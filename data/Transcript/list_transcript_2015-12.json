      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Alicia. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's 2016 outlook conference call. With me here today is Senior Vice President and CFO, Tom Szlosek. This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com/investor. Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings. This morning, we will review our financial expectations for the remainder of 2015 and discuss our 2016 planning, building on the framework we gave you back in October. Finally, as always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end. \r\nSo with that, I will turn the call over to Tom.\n\n---\n\nOkay, thanks, Mark, and good morning everyone. Let's begin on Slide 3 by confirming that our fourth quarter earnings guidance is on track, while core organic sales are coming in slightly lower than we guided. The sales outlook for Aerospace remains in line, but we're experiencing lower volumes in ACS and continued weakness in PMT as a result of lower conversion of the backlog. The good news is that we continue to expect strong segment margin and earnings performance in the quarter, and we are reaffirming our guidance of approximately $1.58 per share before any pension mark-to-market adjustments, so up 10% year-on-year. And based on the current interest rates and year-to-date asset returns in our pension fund, we expect a minimal mark-to-market adjustment in our U.S. pension plans. Free cash flow in the quarter, approximately $1.4 billion, reflecting conversion of 115%, and building on our strong cash performance in the second half of the year. For the full year, we're expecting core organic sales to be up approximately 1% to $38.5 billion. The execution across our portfolio has allowed us to drive continuous margin expansion, and we anticipate closing the year up approximately 220 basis points to 18.8% or 180 basis points, excluding the fourth quarter 2014 OEM incentives. Our strong segment margin performance and continued cost management will drive another year of double-digit earnings growth, up approximately 10% year-on-year to an estimated $6.10 before the pension mark-to-market adjustment. We're expecting free cash flow of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, so up 8% to 10% versus 2014, as we benefit from higher net income and an improvement in working capital. This represents full year conversion of approximately 88%, which includes an elevated level of CapEx at a reinvestment ratio of roughly 165%. So we remain confident in our ability to execute on the earnings guidance we set last December, continuing our track record of delivering strong performance in an even more challenging environment. \r\nMoving to Slide 4. There are number of other important accomplishments for 2015 that don't make it into the core financial numbers, and I want to take a moment to recap some of them. For starters, the upgrades we made to our M&A organization and processes are bearing fruit across the entire portfolio. We announced 5 acquisitions in 4 months and will deploy around $5.5 billion in capital when the transactions close. We're very excited about the software and satellite communication offerings of COM DEV, Satcom 1 and Aviaso. The broad product portfolio that Sigma Aldrich offers -- or adds to our Fine Chemicals business, and the differentiated technologies that Elster will bring to our ACS and PMT portfolios. We also continue to invest in organic growth with over $1 billion in capital expenditures, which is driving above-market growth in the portfolio, particularly in UOP's catalysts business and in Fluorine Products. We maintained our R&D spend at approximately 5% of sales. That's 7% including the customer-funded R&D in our Aerospace business. Last week, we announced that 100% of our global software divisions are compatible with CMMI or Capability Maturity Model Integration Level 5. CMMI maturity Level 5 is the pinnacle of software development excellence and improves software quality, user experience and predictability of schedule and cost. More than half of our 22,000 engineers globally are focused on software development. And as we continue to rollout HOS Gold, we're identifying and funding restructuring projects with attractive paybacks. We expect to invest over $130 million in new restructuring projects this year alone, and expect to see $150 million to $175 million in 2016 benefits. After a 15% increase in 2014, we again increased our annual dividend rate by 15% in 2015, representing the 11th increase in the past 10 years, reflecting our commitment to grow the dividend faster than our earnings growth. And we repurchased almost $2 billion in Honeywell stock or about 2.5% of our market cap, lowering our weighted average share count for the full year to 789 million shares. All-in for 2015, we're deploying approximately $10 billion in capital through CapEx, dividend, M&A and share repurchases or roughly 2.5x the amount we deployed in 2014. So in addition to the strong operational performance, an exciting year for Honeywell in terms of putting our capital to work, and we still have significant balance sheet firepower as we head into 2016. \r\nLet's turn to Slide 5 to provide a little more color around the surge in M&A activity we experienced in the second half of 2015. It's been a good year for Honeywell's M&A. Under Roger Fradin and Anne Madden's leadership, we've reinforced our global M&A team and are looking at broader spaces and adjacencies in our businesses. What hasn't changed is our disciplined M&A approach and our rigorous financial framework. We continue to focus on Great Positions in Good Industries. The businesses we acquired this year align well to key growth themes, including connectivity, energy efficiency and differentiated technology. Our ability to integrate and execute on our synergy plans will continue to drive attractive returns for our shareholders. Since July, we've announced approximately $5.5 billion in acquisitions. In Aerospace, we continued our investments in connectivity with the acquisitions of COM DEV 1 and Satcom 1. COM DEV, a leader in the satellite components market, positions us well as the demand for higher bandwidth drives the need for more components for satellite. Satcom 1 enables us to offer an end-to-end solution for in-flight connectivity, from hardware to airtime and service. We also acquired Aviaso, which bolsters our software offerings to our airline customers to drive fuel savings. In PMT, we're acquiring Sigma Aldrich's research chemicals business, which strengthens our portfolio of high purity research chemicals, adding industry-leading brands to our well-established Fine Chemicals business. And of course, we're looking forward to the Elster close, and making progress on all fronts in that regard working through the antitrust clearance processes and staffing our integration teams. Elster boasts a leading portfolio in gas heating, controls, metering and advanced technologies, and we're confident that our deployment of HOS Gold to the operations of Elster will drive enhanced global growth and attractive cost synergies. We'll provide further color on the integration and plans for growth at our 2016 Investor Day on March 2. Even with a banner year for M&A nearly behind us, there are no signs of slowdown and our pipeline of potential targets is robust. \r\nLet's turn to Slide 6. As we close out 2015, it's also worth reminding everyone of the long-term targets we set in 2014 and how we performed so far against those targets. Now from a top line perspective, it's no revelation that our key end markets have been slower than anticipated, particularly in our energy-related businesses. But we have generated decent growth in certain businesses including Fluorine Products, Transportation Systems and in our high-growth regions. We are far outpacing our 5-year plan of 45 to 75 basis points per year of margin expansion, with improvements across all the businesses. We expect that the permanent improvements to our factories, footprint and supply chain through the deployment of HOS Gold will continue to drive margin expansion over the course of the plan and beyond. From an earnings perspective, the higher margin expansion has more than offset the impact of lower sales, and 2015 should mark our sixth consecutive year of double-digit earnings per share growth. With this performance, our EPS growth was beat -- in the median of our peer group in each of the last 5 years, and we've done it without using our capital to reduce share count. So we've preserved the firepower that we're now putting to work to enhance shareowner returns. \r\nI'm on Slide 7 highlighting how we're thinking about our end markets for 2016. Before I touch on the individual verticals here, I want to point out that our diverse portfolio with its mix of short- and long-cycle businesses that span the globe, provides our shareowners with broad vertical exposure. So for example, while our heritage is B2B, our businesses do have good exposure to consumer, such as through our aero aftermarket, turbocharger and HVAC businesses. And we're aligned to enduring macro trends, that is energy efficiency, clean energy generation, safety and security, urbanization and customer productivity, which means that we can grow even in slower environments. So on balance, we expect a slower growth environment to persist in 2016. In nonresidential construction, we expect demand to remain stable. The Commercial Aftermarket industry will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace as flight hours for air transport and regional are expected to be up 3.5% to 4.5% and for large cabin business jets up 4% to 5% in 2016. But increased airline efficiency and the retirement of older aircraft will temper demand. Defense & Space will be neutral with strong international demand, while U.S. DoD budgets begin to grow. Oil and gas, which represents only 11% of the Honeywell portfolio, will continue to experience headwinds in 2016 as customers aggressively manage their OpEx and CapEx budgets and delay investment decisions as a result of lower oil prices. In vehicles, global auto production has been robust, with good demand for passenger vehicles in the U.S., Europe and China. In addition, global turbo adoption continues to accelerate and we expect global penetration of diesel and gas turbocharger technology in roughly half of all vehicles on the road by 2020. We continue to monitor the Volkswagen emissions matter very closely for implications to our business. Sales to VW represent less than 1% of total Honeywell sales and we are well-positioned from our 40%-plus win rate to benefit from any market shifts. Turbocharging will continue to be a compelling technology to enable OEMs to meet fuel efficiency and emission standards, while enhancing engine performance. On the OE side of Commercial Aero, our air transport customers have healthy backlogs, with a ramp in production that -- expected across several platforms, while business jet growth overall will be lower. For the rest of our key end markets, we're expecting a slight improvement as customers continue to demand products that are safer, more secure and energy-efficient. Our planning philosophy for 2016 is similar to what's worked for the last couple of years. We'll be cautious in our sales planning, while investing to support long-term growth in new products and technologies, including UOP Catalysts and Fluorine Products, as well as further penetration in high-growth regions. But it also means continuing to plan conservatively in terms of our cost structure. So in addition to the ongoing productivity initiatives in our supply chain and function through -- HOS Gold, we're prepared to leverage the flexibility we have to quickly adjust cost levels as the need arises. \r\nSo with that, I'll turn to Slide 8 to talk through our guidance for 2016. We expect core organic sales growth of 1% to 2% for the next year. Reported sales growth will be higher, in the range of 4% to 6%, primarily due to the favorable impact of M&A. We expect Elster to close earlier than anticipated as we're making good progress on the regulatory approvals. Of course, this will not impact our core organic sales rate for the full year. The stronger dollar will be a roughly 1% to 2% headwind to reported sales growth. Segment margins expected to be 18.9% to 19.3%. That's up 10 to 50 basis points on a reported basis, 80 to 110 basis points excluding M&A. Our continued deployment of HOS Gold and key process initiatives will drive further productivity improvements. We also will benefit significantly from executing on the approximate $300 million pool of funded restructuring projects. \r\nEPS excluding pension mark-to-market is expected to be $6.45 to $6.70. So up 6% to 10% assuming a tax rate of approximately 26.5% and share count roughly flat to 2015 full year average. We've discussed previously the FX headwind we're facing in 2016. Our largest exposure remains the euro, which we've hedged roughly 85% of at a rate of approximately $1.10 versus approximately $1.24 in 2015. So FX will be a headwind of roughly $0.15 per share in 2016. For the below the line items, the only significant change in 2016 is our November 15 move from a single weighted average discount rate approach for accruing the interest component of pension expense to the alternative spot rate approach. This will reduce our service and interest cost in 2016 on all plans. As a result, our 2016 pension income will be approximately $125 million higher than 2015 and approximately $25 million higher in the fourth quarter of 2015 than previously guided. We will offset this incremental pension income with funding of new restructuring projects, which in turn will drive further productivity and margin enhancement. \r\nOn cash flow, we expect to generate between $4.6 billion and $4.8 billion free cash flow or an increase of 8% to 13%. CapEx investments will be roughly flat to 2015. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be approximately 90% and we expect to achieve a 100% conversion run rate by the end of 2017, driven by a more normalized rate of CapEx, increasing net income and continued working capital improvements. \r\nNow on Slide 9 to provide more specifics on the 2016 sales plan. We're exiting 2015 at a slower growth rates than we had anticipated at this time last year, in large part due to the market headwinds we faced in our oil and gas businesses. We are planning for a roughly 1% decline associated with these businesses in 2016. Also, for prudency, our planning includes an approximate 1% sales contingency covering approximately 2/3 of our portfolio. For the other 1/3 of the portfolio, we have good visibility to above average growth rates based on orders in backlog, improving end market trends and new wins. For example, we expect good growth in our Solstice products and advanced materials, in transportation systems, in our short-cycle commercial and residential products businesses and in our high-growth regions. All told, these factors should contribute 3% to 4% of growth. We've built a credible and attainable plan predicated on cautious sales planning, conservatism on cost and focused execution. However, if sales trended to the lower end of our range or worse, we are prepared with contingency restructuring capacity and the flexibility to make quick adjustments to our cost structure as necessary to protect our earnings commitment. \r\nMoving to M&A. The 5% to 6% impact represents the additions of Elster, COM DEV, Sigma Aldrich's Fine Chemicals business, Satcom 1 and Aviaso to our portfolio. The positive M&A impact is offset in part by the top line headwind from FX. From a sales perspective, we're conservatively planning the euro at approximately $1 for all of 2016 versus an average of approximately $1.11 in 2015. We expect total reported sales growth to be 4% to 6% in 2016 as a result. \r\nLet's move to Slide 10. Our margin performance has stood out, but it's not coming at the expense of future growth. Reinvesting in our businesses both organically and inorganically is an imperative for the Honeywell leadership team. Every initiative you see on this page reflects this priority. For example, with HOS Gold, we're driving breakthrough initiatives, which are smart bets to create new technologies and new markets to outperform our peers. HOS Gold also creates operating efficiency, which begets further restructuring opportunity, and we expect to see a minimum of $150 million in restructuring benefit in 2016. \r\nLet me move to Slide 11, the segment margin drivers. We're always being probed on segment margins in the businesses. What inning are we in? How much juice is in the lemon? Aren't you already at your long-term targets, and so forth. To give you an idea, to date there are approximately 50 ISC plants in our portfolio that are in full-scale HOS deployment, but are not even yet at bronze status. And an additional 85 plants that have not yet reached silver certification. Another example of the opportunity would be the recent portfolio alignments. While announced, we barely scratched the surface on the commercial and productivity improvements we will obtain from the realignment of the ACS portfolio as an example. And in Aerospace, you heard us talk about how inefficient and slow the industry is. Tim and his team are just getting ramped up at making our own aero supply chain more efficient. And we're already starting to see improvement where it matters most: on-time delivery to our customers. There are plenty of examples where we can improve our operations and cost structure, and thereby expand segment margin even in a slow-growth environment. And there are also plenty of levers to do so. The Honeywell User Experience is driving new products at higher margins. Our factories and sourcing organizations continue to mature under HOS Gold. We're leveraging the favorable commodities-driven sourcing environment. We continue to re-engineer our products to make them easier and less expensive to manufacture. Our functional transformation has been reinvigorated to improve the quality of our back-office while reducing its cost. And we continue to manage our indirect spend stringently. With these drivers in mind, we see 2016 as another year of meaningful margin expansion for Honeywell. Excluding the dilutive impact of the announced acquisitions, we expect margin will expand in a range of 80 to 110 basis points above the long-term targets of 45 to 75 basis points per year we originally set in 2014. On a reported basis, the margins are expected to expand 10 to 50 basis points, reflecting the year one dilutive impacts of M&A. \r\nI'm now on Slide 12, which bridges our 2015 earnings per share to that of 2016. We have a credible path to the EPS guidance for '16. Most of the EPS growth comes from the business segments through commercial excellence, new product introductions, continued productivity and the savings from prior period restructuring. In addition, the announced M&A deals, depending on the timing of their closing, will drive between $0.05 and $0.15 of earnings per share growth in 2016. On a run-rate basis, excluding onetime M&A costs and amortization, Elster is expected to eventually provide approximately $0.40 to $0.50 of EPS within a couple of years once the business is integrated and the synergies are achieved. I've discussed the 2016 FX headwind. Items below segment margin, including pension income and restructuring, are expected to be net flat and our tax rate is expected to remain at 26.5%. Of course, there will be puts and takes across the portfolio over the course of 2016, but our focus on growth where we can get it, conservative sales planning, continued productivity and balance sheet capacity give us the confidence that we built a credible plan. \r\nLet's turn to the strategic business units for some additional color. I'm on Slide 13, with the Aerospace outlook. Starting with the industry drivers on the left, flight hours are expected to grow at a similar pace in '16 as in '15. On the business jet side, the large cabin flight hours reflect continued demand in the cabin size sector where we have the most strength. Defense spending is expected to grow, particularly in the U.S , and should also continue to grow internationally given continuing global and regional tensions. We expect a modest pickup in vehicle production globally, while turbo penetration is expected to accelerate on light vehicle gas applications, particularly in the U.S. and China where we see healthy adoption rates. For aero, sales are expected in the range of $15.3 billion to $15.6 billion, up 1% to 2% on a reported and core organic basis with a 1 point benefit from M&A, offset by a 1 point headwind from foreign exchange. In Commercial OE, we're expecting core organic sales to be down mid-single-digit overall, driven by an increase in OEM incentives year-over-year. We have won significant content in the air transport and business aviation sectors, and this pickup in incentives reflects the ongoing cost of developing and growing our installed base in this industry. These incentives can vary from year-to-year and are fully incorporated into all of our planning, including the 2018 targets we shared with you in 2014. We point these incentives out when they create significant variation as we did in last year's fourth quarter. And depending on their nature, the incentives are treated as a reduction of revenue or as a cost. Either way, they reduce segment profit when incurred. This is in contrast to others in the industry who capitalize these costs on the balance sheet and gradually amortize them as a charge to earnings over future periods. We believe that our approach gives the greatest transparency to these incentives and avoid the unnecessary burden on future profits that comes with balance sheet capitalization. Now excluding the impact of the 2016 OEM incentives, Commercial OE sales are expected to increase low single digit. We're planning for low single-digit growth in BGA following a terrific year of double-digit growth in 2015, driven by strong engine shipments. We have very strong positions, but the BGA OE environment is softer. We're expecting improvement in ATR OE, with a ramp-up of key platforms like the Airbus A350 and A320 and the Boeing 737 and 787. Our Commercial Aftermarket business is expected to grow low single-digit again in 2016, with more volumes in airline repair and overhaul activity and higher maintenance events in BGA. On the spare side, we expect growth in line with flight hours. In Defense & Space, we're encouraged by the continued wins on the international side as well as the expected growth in our U.S. DoD business. In Transportation Systems, we expect to maintain our 40% plus win rate in competitions in 2015, which will help the business grow mid- or low to mid-single digits in 2016. However, commercial vehicles, which represent only about 15% of TS portfolio, continue to face headwinds from a downmarket. Aerospace segment margin is expected to be up 60 to 100 basis points or 80 to 120 basis points, excluding the impact of M&A, with contributions from both the legacy aerospace business and Transportation Systems. This business is doing it through the deployment of our T&A [ph] orders, with a particular focus on supply chain productivity, continued cost discipline and driving further efficiency across the segment. \r\nI'm now on Slide 14 with the ACS outlook. On the left, we have split the segment into the main verticals: residential, commercial and industrial. And as you can see, we're expecting a similar macro environment in '16, with improving residential construction growth, slow industrial production and moderating growth in commercial spending. Parts of our ACS portfolio, for example, industrial safety and sensing and productivity solutions, are driven by a variety of factors other than those indicated here, including spend by utilities, retailers and governments. We're expecting ACS core organic sales to be up 1% to 2% or 9% to 12% on a reported basis, with the difference primarily driven by the Elster acquisition. In ESS, we expect new product introductions and continued high-growth region penetration to drive the growth in 2016. Acceleration will come from our energy efficiency and connected products and technologies, along with continued growth in our Security and Fire business. After 4 straight quarters of double-digit growth, SNPS will see difficult comps beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 as we lap the benefits of the U.S. Postal Service win. Our ACS China business unit will continue to grow strongly, driven by our One ACS China business strategy, localized business decision making and new product development, as well as continued penetration of Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. We've also maintained our investments, adding resources in sales, marketing and engineering locally to drive further growth in China. On the industrial side, we expect continued headwinds in industrial safety driven by the oil and gas softness. In BSD, we're expecting improvement in Building Solutions driven by backlog and service bank conversion, while the Americas Distribution business should continue its strong top line growth. ACS segment margins expected to grow between 110 and 140 basis points, excluding the impact from M&A. So a continuation of the good margin expansion we saw in '15. The connected ACS initiative is driving results as we continue to identify and implement opportunities to leverage our scale in the supply chain, R&D, marketing and back office. As expected, Elster will be dilutive to ACS segment margin in 2016. The healthy margins underlying this acquisition will be offset by the typical first year impacts from purchase accounting and integration costs. To be clear, this was reflected in the deal model, which continues to meet our return expectations, including greater than 10% ROI in year 5. \r\nMoving to Slide 15 with the PMT outlook. You can see expectations for the key market drivers. After significant declines this year, we expect continued cuts in CapEx and minimal improvement in operating expenditures despite the easier comps. We expect the oil and gas environment will remain difficult with project delays, lower oil and gas rig counts, and as we've again experienced in the last few weeks, lower and more volatile oil prices. These conditions are likely to remain, and we've build our plans accordingly. PMT sales are expected to be $9.3 billion to $9.5 billion in 2016, a range of down 1% to up 1% on a core organic basis or up 1% to 4% reported, driven by the impacts of the Elster and Sigma Aldrich transactions. In UOP, as you're aware, the business comprises 4 primary revenue streams: technology licensing, engineering and services, equipment and catalysts. And for most of 2015, equipment orders were down in UOP, particularly in our U.S. midstream gas processing business, as well as in refining and petrochemicals. On the other hand, orders and sales for our catalyst products were robust throughout 2015. This quarter, we've continued to see growth in catalyst orders and as well an uptick in licensing, engineering and equipment orders, including for modular gas processing technology. As a result, total orders in UOP will be up significantly in the fourth quarter and will serve to keep our backlog, heading into 2016, down less than 10% from 2015 year-end levels. However, we are planning for generally slow conversion in this backlog and the possibility for continued deferral of investment decisions. With this backdrop, UOP 2016 sales are expected to be down mid-single-digits on a core organic basis. We expect continued demand for our catalyst technologies in both initial loads and reloads and the declines in our technology licensing and equipment businesses will moderate off an easier comparison. International orders for modular equipment in our gas processing business partially offset the softness we continue to experience in the U.S. In Process Solutions, with global megaprojects and reasonable stability in our service bank, we expect to enter 2016 with backlog up high single digit. Like UOP, the conversion of orders from HPS backlog has also been slower. However, we have seen some positive momentum recently on projects that were previously on hold. Our new product introductions, particularly in software and cybersecurity, along with improved win rates from joint HPS-UOP bids, will drive an improvement in 2016 sales growth rates for HPS. In Advanced Materials, sales are expected to increase mid-single digit on a core organic basis, driven by the ramp in Solstice product deliveries. This growth in Solstice technology is accelerating as we had anticipated and will be an even bigger driver to growth next year. We also expect improved volumes in Resins & Chemicals from better plant performance and an increase in specialty products volumes from new applications. PMT segment margins are expected to be up 30 to 60 basis points, excluding the impact of M&A. We expect to drive benefits from commercial excellence and continued productivity initiatives. PMT also continues to aggressively pursue further cost reduction opportunities, which should help further support margin expansion. \r\nLet me wrap up on Slide 16 before turning it back over to Mark for Q&A. In a couple of weeks, we'll complete another terrific year. We overcame significant macro headwinds and our businesses are executing well. We're finishing 2015 strongly with fourth quarter earnings tracking to our previous guidance, despite continued market slowness. We continue to deploy capital smartly, setting us up for further improvement and shareowner return. We've built a conservative and credible plan for 2016. Our growth assumptions are conservative, our productivity initiatives are working, and we have demonstrated the ability to perform in tough markets. We've also got a robust pipeline of funded restructuring, M&A tailwinds and a very healthy balance sheet. So while 2016 will be far from easy, we are confident that we'll once again perform well for our shareowners. \r\nSo with that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.\n\n---\n\nThank you, operator. If you can open up the line for questions.",

Let's begin on Slide 3 by confirming that our fourth quarter earnings guidance is on track, while core organic sales are coming in slightly lower than we guided. The sales outlook for Aerospace remains in line, but we're experiencing lower volumes in ACS and continued weakness in PMT as a result of lower conversion of the backlog. The good news is that we continue to expect strong segment margin and earnings performance in the quarter, and we are reaffirming our guidance of approximately $1.58 per share before any pension mark-to-market adjustments, so up 10% year-on-year. And based on the current interest rates and year-to-date asset returns in our pension fund, we expect a minimal mark-to-market adjustment in our U.S. pension plans. Free cash flow in the quarter, approximately $1.4 billion, reflecting conversion of 115%, and building on our strong cash performance in the second half of the year. For the full year, we're expecting core organic sales to be up approximately 1% to $38.5 billion. The execution across our portfolio has allowed us to drive continuous margin expansion, and we anticipate closing the year up approximately 220 basis points to 18.8% or 180 basis points, excluding the fourth quarter 2014 OEM incentives. Our strong segment margin performance and continued cost management will drive another year of double-digit earnings growth, up approximately 10% year-on-year to an estimated $6.10 before the pension mark-to-market adjustment. We're expecting free cash flow of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, so up 8% to 10% versus 2014, as we benefit from higher net income and an improvement in working capital. This represents full year conversion of approximately 88%, which includes an elevated level of CapEx at a reinvestment ratio of roughly 165%. So we remain confident in our ability to execute on the earnings guidance we set last December, continuing our track record of delivering strong performance in an even more challenging environment. \r\nMoving to Slide 4. There are number of other important accomplishments for 2015 that don't make it into the core financial numbers, and I want to take a moment to recap some of them. For starters, the upgrades we made to our M&A organization and processes are bearing fruit across the entire portfolio. We announced 5 acquisitions in 4 months and will deploy around $5.5 billion in capital when the transactions close. We're very excited about the software and satellite communication offerings of COM DEV, Satcom 1 and Aviaso. The broad product portfolio that Sigma Aldrich offers -- or adds to our Fine Chemicals business, and the differentiated technologies that Elster will bring to our ACS and PMT portfolios. We also continue to invest in organic growth with over $1 billion in capital expenditures, which is driving above-market growth in the portfolio, particularly in UOP's catalysts business and in Fluorine Products. We maintained our R&D spend at approximately 5% of sales. That's 7% including the customer-funded R&D in our Aerospace business. Last week, we announced that 100% of our global software divisions are compatible with CMMI or Capability Maturity Model Integration Level 5. CMMI maturity Level 5 is the pinnacle of software development excellence and improves software quality, user experience and predictability of schedule and cost. More than half of our 22,000 engineers globally are focused on software development. And as we continue to rollout HOS Gold, we're identifying and funding restructuring projects with attractive paybacks. We expect to invest over $130 million in new restructuring projects this year alone, and expect to see $150 million to $175 million in 2016 benefits. After a 15% increase in 2014, we again increased our annual dividend rate by 15% in 2015, representing the 11th increase in the past 10 years, reflecting our commitment to grow the dividend faster than our earnings growth. And we repurchased almost $2 billion in Honeywell stock or about 2.5% of our market cap, lowering our weighted average share count for the full year to 789 million shares. All-in for 2015, we're deploying approximately $10 billion in capital through CapEx, dividend, M&A and share repurchases or roughly 2.5x the amount we deployed in 2014. So in addition to the strong operational performance, an exciting year for Honeywell in terms of putting our capital to work, and we still have significant balance sheet firepower as we head into 2016. \r\nLet's turn to Slide 5 to provide a little more color around the surge in M&A activity we experienced in the second half of 2015. It's been a good year for Honeywell's M&A. Under Roger Fradin and Anne Madden's leadership, we've reinforced our global M&A team and are looking at broader spaces and adjacencies in our businesses. What hasn't changed is our disciplined M&A approach and our rigorous financial framework. We continue to focus on Great Positions in Good Industries. The businesses we acquired this year align well to key growth themes, including connectivity, energy efficiency and differentiated technology. Our ability to integrate and execute on our synergy plans will continue to drive attractive returns for our shareholders. Since July, we've announced approximately $5.5 billion in acquisitions. In Aerospace, we continued our investments in connectivity with the acquisitions of COM DEV 1 and Satcom 1. COM DEV, a leader in the satellite components market, positions us well as the demand for higher bandwidth drives the need for more components for satellite. Satcom 1 enables us to offer an end-to-end solution for in-flight connectivity, from hardware to airtime and service. We also acquired Aviaso, which bolsters our software offerings to our airline customers to drive fuel savings. In PMT, we're acquiring Sigma Aldrich's research chemicals business, which strengthens our portfolio of high purity research chemicals, adding industry-leading brands to our well-established Fine Chemicals business. And of course, we're looking forward to the Elster close, and making progress on all fronts in that regard working through the antitrust clearance processes and staffing our integration teams. Elster boasts a leading portfolio in gas heating, controls, metering and advanced technologies, and we're confident that our deployment of HOS Gold to the operations of Elster will drive enhanced global growth and attractive cost synergies. We'll provide further color on the integration and plans for growth at our 2016 Investor Day on March 2. Even with a banner year for M&A nearly behind us, there are no signs of slowdown and our pipeline of potential targets is robust. \r\nLet's turn to Slide 6. As we close out 2015, it's also worth reminding everyone of the long-term targets we set in 2014 and how we performed so far against those targets. Now from a top line perspective, it's no revelation that our key end markets have been slower than anticipated, particularly in our energy-related businesses. But we have generated decent growth in certain businesses including Fluorine Products, Transportation Systems and in our high-growth regions. We are far outpacing our 5-year plan of 45 to 75 basis points per year of margin expansion, with improvements across all the businesses. We expect that the permanent improvements to our factories, footprint and supply chain through the deployment of HOS Gold will continue to drive margin expansion over the course of the plan and beyond. From an earnings perspective, the higher margin expansion has more than offset the impact of lower sales, and 2015 should mark our sixth consecutive year of double-digit earnings per share growth. With this performance, our EPS growth was beat -- in the median of our peer group in each of the last 5 years, and we've done it without using our capital to reduce share count. So we've preserved the firepower that we're now putting to work to enhance shareowner returns. \r\nI'm on Slide 7 highlighting how we're thinking about our end markets for 2016. Before I touch on the individual verticals here, I want to point out that our diverse portfolio with its mix of short- and long-cycle businesses that span the globe, provides our shareowners with broad vertical exposure. So for example, while our heritage is B2B, our businesses do have good exposure to consumer, such as through our aero aftermarket, turbocharger and HVAC businesses. And we're aligned to enduring macro trends, that is energy efficiency, clean energy generation, safety and security, urbanization and customer productivity, which means that we can grow even in slower environments. So on balance, we expect a slower growth environment to persist in 2016. In nonresidential construction, we expect demand to remain stable. The Commercial Aftermarket industry will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace as flight hours for air transport and regional are expected to be up 3.5% to 4.5% and for large cabin business jets up 4% to 5% in 2016. But increased airline efficiency and the retirement of older aircraft will temper demand. Defense & Space will be neutral with strong international demand, while U.S. DoD budgets begin to grow. Oil and gas, which represents only 11% of the Honeywell portfolio, will continue to experience headwinds in 2016 as customers aggressively manage their OpEx and CapEx budgets and delay investment decisions as a result of lower oil prices. In vehicles, global auto production has been robust, with good demand for passenger vehicles in the U.S., Europe and China. In addition, global turbo adoption continues to accelerate and we expect global penetration of diesel and gas turbocharger technology in roughly half of all vehicles on the road by 2020. We continue to monitor the Volkswagen emissions matter very closely for implications to our business. Sales to VW represent less than 1% of total Honeywell sales and we are well-positioned from our 40%-plus win rate to benefit from any market shifts. Turbocharging will continue to be a compelling technology to enable OEMs to meet fuel efficiency and emission standards, while enhancing engine performance. On the OE side of Commercial Aero, our air transport customers have healthy backlogs, with a ramp in production that -- expected across several platforms, while business jet growth overall will be lower. For the rest of our key end markets, we're expecting a slight improvement as customers continue to demand products that are safer, more secure and energy-efficient. Our planning philosophy for 2016 is similar to what's worked for the last couple of years. We'll be cautious in our sales planning, while investing to support long-term growth in new products and technologies, including UOP Catalysts and Fluorine Products, as well as further penetration in high-growth regions. But it also means continuing to plan conservatively in terms of our cost structure. So in addition to the ongoing productivity initiatives in our supply chain and function through -- HOS Gold, we're prepared to leverage the flexibility we have to quickly adjust cost levels as the need arises. \r\nSo with that, I'll turn to Slide 8 to talk through our guidance for 2016. We expect core organic sales growth of 1% to 2% for the next year. Reported sales growth will be higher, in the range of 4% to 6%, primarily due to the favorable impact of M&A. We expect Elster to close earlier than anticipated as we're making good progress on the regulatory approvals. Of course, this will not impact our core organic sales rate for the full year. The stronger dollar will be a roughly 1% to 2% headwind to reported sales growth. Segment margins expected to be 18.9% to 19.3%. That's up 10 to 50 basis points on a reported basis, 80 to 110 basis points excluding M&A. Our continued deployment of HOS Gold and key process initiatives will drive further productivity improvements. We also will benefit significantly from executing on the approximate $300 million pool of funded restructuring projects. \r\nEPS excluding pension mark-to-market is expected to be $6.45 to $6.70. So up 6% to 10% assuming a tax rate of approximately 26.5% and share count roughly flat to 2015 full year average. We've discussed previously the FX headwind we're facing in 2016. Our largest exposure remains the euro, which we've hedged roughly 85% of at a rate of approximately $1.10 versus approximately $1.24 in 2015. So FX will be a headwind of roughly $0.15 per share in 2016. For the below the line items, the only significant change in 2016 is our November 15 move from a single weighted average discount rate approach for accruing the interest component of pension expense to the alternative spot rate approach. This will reduce our service and interest cost in 2016 on all plans. As a result, our 2016 pension income will be approximately $125 million higher than 2015 and approximately $25 million higher in the fourth quarter of 2015 than previously guided. We will offset this incremental pension income with funding of new restructuring projects, which in turn will drive further productivity and margin enhancement. \r\nOn cash flow, we expect to generate between $4.6 billion and $4.8 billion free cash flow or an increase of 8% to 13%. CapEx investments will be roughly flat to 2015. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be approximately 90% and we expect to achieve a 100% conversion run rate by the end of 2017, driven by a more normalized rate of CapEx, increasing net income and continued working capital improvements. \r\nNow on Slide 9 to provide more specifics on the 2016 sales plan. We're exiting 2015 at a slower growth rates than we had anticipated at this time last year, in large part due to the market headwinds we faced in our oil and gas businesses. We are planning for a roughly 1% decline associated with these businesses in 2016. Also, for prudency, our planning includes an approximate 1% sales contingency covering approximately 2/3 of our portfolio. For the other 1/3 of the portfolio, we have good visibility to above average growth rates based on orders in backlog, improving end market trends and new wins. For example, we expect good growth in our Solstice products and advanced materials, in transportation systems, in our short-cycle commercial and residential products businesses and in our high-growth regions. All told, these factors should contribute 3% to 4% of growth. We've built a credible and attainable plan predicated on cautious sales planning, conservatism on cost and focused execution. However, if sales trended to the lower end of our range or worse, we are prepared with contingency restructuring capacity and the flexibility to make quick adjustments to our cost structure as necessary to protect our earnings commitment. \r\nMoving to M&A. The 5% to 6% impact represents the additions of Elster, COM DEV, Sigma Aldrich's Fine Chemicals business, Satcom 1 and Aviaso to our portfolio. The positive M&A impact is offset in part by the top line headwind from FX. From a sales perspective, we're conservatively planning the euro at approximately $1 for all of 2016 versus an average of approximately $1.11 in 2015. We expect total reported sales growth to be 4% to 6% in 2016 as a result. \r\nLet's move to Slide 10. Our margin performance has stood out, but it's not coming at the expense of future growth. Reinvesting in our businesses both organically and inorganically is an imperative for the Honeywell leadership team. Every initiative you see on this page reflects this priority. For example, with HOS Gold, we're driving breakthrough initiatives, which are smart bets to create new technologies and new markets to outperform our peers. HOS Gold also creates operating efficiency, which begets further restructuring opportunity, and we expect to see a minimum of $150 million in restructuring benefit in 2016. \r\nLet me move to Slide 11, the segment margin drivers. We're always being probed on segment margins in the businesses. What inning are we in? How much juice is in the lemon? Aren't you already at your long-term targets, and so forth. To give you an idea, to date there are approximately 50 ISC plants in our portfolio that are in full-scale HOS deployment, but are not even yet at bronze status. And an additional 85 plants that have not yet reached silver certification. Another example of the opportunity would be the recent portfolio alignments. While announced, we barely scratched the surface on the commercial and productivity improvements we will obtain from the realignment of the ACS portfolio as an example. And in Aerospace, you heard us talk about how inefficient and slow the industry is. Tim and his team are just getting ramped up at making our own aero supply chain more efficient. And we're already starting to see improvement where it matters most: on-time delivery to our customers. There are plenty of examples where we can improve our operations and cost structure, and thereby expand segment margin even in a slow-growth environment. And there are also plenty of levers to do so. The Honeywell User Experience is driving new products at higher margins. Our factories and sourcing organizations continue to mature under HOS Gold. We're leveraging the favorable commodities-driven sourcing environment. We continue to re-engineer our products to make them easier and less expensive to manufacture. Our functional transformation has been reinvigorated to improve the quality of our back-office while reducing its cost. And we continue to manage our indirect spend stringently. With these drivers in mind, we see 2016 as another year of meaningful margin expansion for Honeywell. Excluding the dilutive impact of the announced acquisitions, we expect margin will expand in a range of 80 to 110 basis points above the long-term targets of 45 to 75 basis points per year we originally set in 2014. On a reported basis, the margins are expected to expand 10 to 50 basis points, reflecting the year one dilutive impacts of M&A. \r\nI'm now on Slide 12, which bridges our 2015 earnings per share to that of 2016. We have a credible path to the EPS guidance for '16. Most of the EPS growth comes from the business segments through commercial excellence, new product introductions, continued productivity and the savings from prior period restructuring. In addition, the announced M&A deals, depending on the timing of their closing, will drive between $0.05 and $0.15 of earnings per share growth in 2016. On a run-rate basis, excluding onetime M&A costs and amortization, Elster is expected to eventually provide approximately $0.40 to $0.50 of EPS within a couple of years once the business is integrated and the synergies are achieved. I've discussed the 2016 FX headwind. Items below segment margin, including pension income and restructuring, are expected to be net flat and our tax rate is expected to remain at 26.5%. Of course, there will be puts and takes across the portfolio over the course of 2016, but our focus on growth where we can get it, conservative sales planning, continued productivity and balance sheet capacity give us the confidence that we built a credible plan. \r\nLet's turn to the strategic business units for some additional color. I'm on Slide 13, with the Aerospace outlook. Starting with the industry drivers on the left, flight hours are expected to grow at a similar pace in '16 as in '15. On the business jet side, the large cabin flight hours reflect continued demand in the cabin size sector where we have the most strength. Defense spending is expected to grow, particularly in the U.S , and should also continue to grow internationally given continuing global and regional tensions. We expect a modest pickup in vehicle production globally, while turbo penetration is expected to accelerate on light vehicle gas applications, particularly in the U.S. and China where we see healthy adoption rates. For aero, sales are expected in the range of $15.3 billion to $15.6 billion, up 1% to 2% on a reported and core organic basis with a 1 point benefit from M&A, offset by a 1 point headwind from foreign exchange. In Commercial OE, we're expecting core organic sales to be down mid-single-digit overall, driven by an increase in OEM incentives year-over-year. We have won significant content in the air transport and business aviation sectors, and this pickup in incentives reflects the ongoing cost of developing and growing our installed base in this industry. These incentives can vary from year-to-year and are fully incorporated into all of our planning, including the 2018 targets we shared with you in 2014. We point these incentives out when they create significant variation as we did in last year's fourth quarter. And depending on their nature, the incentives are treated as a reduction of revenue or as a cost. Either way, they reduce segment profit when incurred. This is in contrast to others in the industry who capitalize these costs on the balance sheet and gradually amortize them as a charge to earnings over future periods. We believe that our approach gives the greatest transparency to these incentives and avoid the unnecessary burden on future profits that comes with balance sheet capitalization. Now excluding the impact of the 2016 OEM incentives, Commercial OE sales are expected to increase low single digit. We're planning for low single-digit growth in BGA following a terrific year of double-digit growth in 2015, driven by strong engine shipments. We have very strong positions, but the BGA OE environment is softer. We're expecting improvement in ATR OE, with a ramp-up of key platforms like the Airbus A350 and A320 and the Boeing 737 and 787. Our Commercial Aftermarket business is expected to grow low single-digit again in 2016, with more volumes in airline repair and overhaul activity and higher maintenance events in BGA. On the spare side, we expect growth in line with flight hours. In Defense & Space, we're encouraged by the continued wins on the international side as well as the expected growth in our U.S. DoD business. In Transportation Systems, we expect to maintain our 40% plus win rate in competitions in 2015, which will help the business grow mid- or low to mid-single digits in 2016. However, commercial vehicles, which represent only about 15% of TS portfolio, continue to face headwinds from a downmarket. Aerospace segment margin is expected to be up 60 to 100 basis points or 80 to 120 basis points, excluding the impact of M&A, with contributions from both the legacy aerospace business and Transportation Systems. This business is doing it through the deployment of our T&A [ph] orders, with a particular focus on supply chain productivity, continued cost discipline and driving further efficiency across the segment. \r\nI'm now on Slide 14 with the ACS outlook. On the left, we have split the segment into the main verticals: residential, commercial and industrial. And as you can see, we're expecting a similar macro environment in '16, with improving residential construction growth, slow industrial production and moderating growth in commercial spending. Parts of our ACS portfolio, for example, industrial safety and sensing and productivity solutions, are driven by a variety of factors other than those indicated here, including spend by utilities, retailers and governments. We're expecting ACS core organic sales to be up 1% to 2% or 9% to 12% on a reported basis, with the difference primarily driven by the Elster acquisition. In ESS, we expect new product introductions and continued high-growth region penetration to drive the growth in 2016. Acceleration will come from our energy efficiency and connected products and technologies, along with continued growth in our Security and Fire business. After 4 straight quarters of double-digit growth, SNPS will see difficult comps beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 as we lap the benefits of the U.S. Postal Service win. Our ACS China business unit will continue to grow strongly, driven by our One ACS China business strategy, localized business decision making and new product development, as well as continued penetration of Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. We've also maintained our investments, adding resources in sales, marketing and engineering locally to drive further growth in China. On the industrial side, we expect continued headwinds in industrial safety driven by the oil and gas softness. In BSD, we're expecting improvement in Building Solutions driven by backlog and service bank conversion, while the Americas Distribution business should continue its strong top line growth. ACS segment margins expected to grow between 110 and 140 basis points, excluding the impact from M&A. So a continuation of the good margin expansion we saw in '15. The connected ACS initiative is driving results as we continue to identify and implement opportunities to leverage our scale in the supply chain, R&D, marketing and back office. As expected, Elster will be dilutive to ACS segment margin in 2016. The healthy margins underlying this acquisition will be offset by the typical first year impacts from purchase accounting and integration costs. To be clear, this was reflected in the deal model, which continues to meet our return expectations, including greater than 10% ROI in year 5. \r\nMoving to Slide 15 with the PMT outlook. You can see expectations for the key market drivers. After significant declines this year, we expect continued cuts in CapEx and minimal improvement in operating expenditures despite the easier comps. We expect the oil and gas environment will remain difficult with project delays, lower oil and gas rig counts, and as we've again experienced in the last few weeks, lower and more volatile oil prices. These conditions are likely to remain, and we've build our plans accordingly. PMT sales are expected to be $9.3 billion to $9.5 billion in 2016, a range of down 1% to up 1% on a core organic basis or up 1% to 4% reported, driven by the impacts of the Elster and Sigma Aldrich transactions. In UOP, as you're aware, the business comprises 4 primary revenue streams: technology licensing, engineering and services, equipment and catalysts. And for most of 2015, equipment orders were down in UOP, particularly in our U.S. midstream gas processing business, as well as in refining and petrochemicals. On the other hand, orders and sales for our catalyst products were robust throughout 2015. This quarter, we've continued to see growth in catalyst orders and as well an uptick in licensing, engineering and equipment orders, including for modular gas processing technology. As a result, total orders in UOP will be up significantly in the fourth quarter and will serve to keep our backlog, heading into 2016, down less than 10% from 2015 year-end levels. However, we are planning for generally slow conversion in this backlog and the possibility for continued deferral of investment decisions. With this backdrop, UOP 2016 sales are expected to be down mid-single-digits on a core organic basis. We expect continued demand for our catalyst technologies in both initial loads and reloads and the declines in our technology licensing and equipment businesses will moderate off an easier comparison. International orders for modular equipment in our gas processing business partially offset the softness we continue to experience in the U.S. In Process Solutions, with global megaprojects and reasonable stability in our service bank, we expect to enter 2016 with backlog up high single digit. Like UOP, the conversion of orders from HPS backlog has also been slower. However, we have seen some positive momentum recently on projects that were previously on hold. Our new product introductions, particularly in software and cybersecurity, along with improved win rates from joint HPS-UOP bids, will drive an improvement in 2016 sales growth rates for HPS. In Advanced Materials, sales are expected to increase mid-single digit on a core organic basis, driven by the ramp in Solstice product deliveries. This growth in Solstice technology is accelerating as we had anticipated and will be an even bigger driver to growth next year. We also expect improved volumes in Resins & Chemicals from better plant performance and an increase in specialty products volumes from new applications. PMT segment margins are expected to be up 30 to 60 basis points, excluding the impact of M&A. We expect to drive benefits from commercial excellence and continued productivity initiatives. PMT also continues to aggressively pursue further cost reduction opportunities, which should help further support margin expansion. \r\nLet me wrap up on Slide 16 before turning it back over to Mark for Q&A. In a couple of weeks, we'll complete another terrific year. We overcame significant macro headwinds and our businesses are executing well. We're finishing 2015 strongly with fourth quarter earnings tracking to our previous guidance, despite continued market slowness. We continue to deploy capital smartly, setting us up for further improvement and shareowner return. We've built a conservative and credible plan for 2016. Our growth assumptions are conservative, our productivity initiatives are working, and we have demonstrated the ability to perform in tough markets. We've also got a robust pipeline of funded restructuring, M&A tailwinds and a very healthy balance sheet. So while 2016 will be far from easy, we are confident that we'll once again perform well for our shareowners. \r\nSo with that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Macaluso (Executives)】\nThank you, operator. If you can open up the line for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Congrats on the good finish of '15. First, I mean you really picked up the deal flow this year and pretty interesting transactions and you talked about still having some balance sheet firepower. I mean you put $5.5 billion to work this year, and presumably the M&A market maybe gets a little bit better in the next year even than it's been in the last. I mean what kind of firepower are we talking that you'd be comfortable and putting to work?\n\n---\n\nTo be honest with you, Scott, I don't think it's changed that much from what we've talked about before. I mean, we're generating close to $5 billion in cash a year that we can put to work before CapEx. So to the extent we lever and we've added -- we will have added a little bit more debt for Elster, we can quickly delever. So it's that strong cash flow, it's that solid balance sheet, the capacity is strong and we're not really limiting ourselves in any way, shape or form. And the businesses have very robust pipelines, so I...\n\n---\n\nSomething in the neighborhood of another $5.5 billion year is possible? Is that -- I hate to pin you down on numbers, but trying to think in terms of what you guys think is...\n\n---\n\nYes, I wouldn't want to commit to that, but that's always possible. Knowing what's in our pipeline, I could easily see that happening.\n\n---\n\nAnd then, just as a follow-up, UOP has been a business, I think many of us probably have struggled to model. How does it stress test at $30 oil and $2 gas? I see your assumptions, but certainly your $45 to $55 oil number, I don't see a gas assumption here. But how does that business, at least historically, stand up at these types of commodity levels? Or just -- I've been told sometimes it doesn't correlate, and I struggle to understand that too. So maybe you could explain how you guys think about it?\n\n---\n\nThe way I'm looking at it is that you have to look at where UOP is positioned in that whole energy segment. So mostly in that mid- and downstream. And when you think of the customers it's serving, whether it's gas pipelines or refineries or petrochemical plants, they're all operating. And they're operating well. And so they need, certainly, the support from aftermarket on catalysts. And you're seeing that this year. We've got significant catalyst activity, which is a high-profit business for us. I think also you'll start to see the need for more equipment as these downstream operations need to come offline for maintenance. So I think it will hold in. What we've got planned for 2016, I think, reflects still a tough environment and it will be down mid-single digits in '16, but the profitability of business holds up pretty well given the conditions I described.\n\n---\n\nCan you just walk through the Elster dynamics? I think something in kind of a low single-digit range for the margin there, and I assume that's all encapsulated in ACS. Is there any related restructuring that's coming in below the line in the restructuring segment? I just wanted to kind of be clear on the Elster geography and then just at the end, the related accretion. It sounds like you're calling for a little bit of accretion here versus the no impact prior.\n\n---\n\nRight. So just to make it clear, Steve, I won't get the exact numbers right, but if it's a $2 billion portfolio, about $1.7 billion or so ends up in ACS. The gas processing business in Elster goes to HPS, which is in PMT. But with that said, the margin rates of Elster, as you know, are quite attractive on their own. And in the -- but in the first year, we typically get that M&A-related dilution in the margins from purchase accounting with the one-time write-offs as well as the cost of the integration team. We will fund the required restructuring for Elster on an ongoing basis. So the restructuring provisions that we've got in the plan for 2016 that we've described, the part that offsets the increase in the pension income, that in part, will be used for Elster. But I just want to emphasize that our visibility on the precise integration plan is not much deeper than when we first announced the deal because it's a public company, and we've been kept at the appropriate arm's length. But as soon as it closes, which we expect to be shortly here, we'll be putting those restructuring plans together and hoping -- putting to work the restructuring slots [ph] that were in the plan.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So deal charge is above the line, related restructuring to get the synergies as part of your total below the line restructuring number?\n\n---\n\nThat's the way to think about it, yes.\n\n---\n\nAnd then one last quick question. You guys spent about $1.9 billion on buyback this year, and your calling for share count to be flat next year. What's going on there? Because in the presentation, when you guys talk about deploying capital and every $1 billion represents $0.10 of earnings or whatever, I mean, it's not like the stock has been a barn-burner this year. So I'm not sure what's going on with options. But I mean, is that just conservatism? Is there math around there that I'm missing on -- is there more dilution expected? It just seems like an awful lot of spending for no benefit.\n\n---\n\nYes. Let me explain how we built the plan, Steve. We've historically said and actually operated on the same basis, which is to keep our share count flat. And so what we've done from a share buyback perspective, on an ongoing basis, is really just to buy sufficient shares to offset the dilution from the option exercises that you referred to as well as contributions to our other benefit plans. In the third -- towards the tail end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter when we saw some market disruptions, there were some buying opportunities for us. And we looked ahead at the dilution that we know is coming in the fourth quarter, in the first quarter and the second quarter and said, we can buy ahead for those -- for that expected dilution. So it's -- we think of it as getting ahead of ourselves on dilution when we see opportunistic market conditions, and that's how we're going to approach it. So with that, we've got an acceleration of buyback, and if we've already offset dilution in the third quarter, fourth quarter and first quarter, the subsequent exercises in contributions will moderate that share count back to 2015 levels.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So it's like -- so there's, essentially, some freed up capital, I guess, is what you're saying relative to what you usually do going forward?\n\n---\n\nNo -- well, I mean, let's put it this way. If -- say we were -- say we didn't see market conditions in a way that we would consider opportunistic. We wouldn't really engage in the share buyback activity that you've seen us do historically, because we've already covered the dilution for the fourth quarter, the first quarter, the second quarter -- actually through most of 2016. However, that's not to say that if there were more opportunities in the market, that we wouldn't jump back in and go after, opportunistically, those opportunities.\n\n---\n\nSo tell me, you mentioned -- I think you mentioned $0.40, $0.50 long-term accretion from Elster once this fully embedded, et cetera. How is the profile on getting to that number? Because obviously, '16 has been impacted by deal charges, restructuring, et cetera. Do we get sort of into a $0.25, $0.30 range in '17? And I'm not looking for '17 guidance here but I'm just thinking about the profile to get to that kind of level of accretion.\n\n---\n\nYes, first of all, I want to be clear that, that $0.40 to $0.50 was on an amortization and purchase accounting adjusted basis. So when you factor in the amortization, that will bring that accretion down a bit. But with that said, we're going to be, knock on wood, hopefully, getting to work earlier on trying to drive some of those synergies. And the biggest ones are on the sourcing side as you would imagine. So day one as soon as this thing closes, which we're on the cusp of, we'll be engaging and that will be the primary basis for driving that accretion in Elster. Of course, as we -- as our integration teams get into the operation of the supply chain, the back office and so forth, those activities tend to lag a little bit, but those will continue to be a contributor to that ongoing improvement in Elster. Not ready yet to say what the '17 impact will be because, again, we're sort of early days in terms of the detailed visibility we need to make those assessments.\n\n---\n\nYes, fair enough. And then just wanted to dig into your comments about the HPS backlog momentum. Can you maybe just give some color on where you're seeing that -- some momentum, where you're seeing projects starting to break free. Perhaps the kinds of profiles, refineries versus -- refinery versus maybe downstream chemical. Where you are seeing that momentum, Tom?\n\n---\n\nI'd say it's across the various verticals. Remember, HPS serves more than just the oil and gas vertical. And so if you think of a little bit of upstream, midstream as well as the downstream core DCS, we're seeing it across. We've gotten a couple of nice megaproject orders as well that have contributed to that backlog. I'd say, outside of the U.S. probably growing stronger than inside the U.S. from a backlog perspective.\n\n---\n\nOkay. A quick clarification on the UOP backlog. You mentioned down less than 10%. Is that organic? Or is that in dollar terms?\n\n---\n\nYes, that's organic. Yes.\n\n---\n\nThat's organic, yes.\n\n---\n\nJust a question, could you give us some more detailed view on what you are guys seeing in emerging markets and, specifically, China? Just a lot of conflicting data coming out of the region.\n\n---\n\nYes, that's a good question. For us, we've had some really strong results in ACS China as we talked about. As we've -- so 2015, when you look at ACS, it's been good double-digit earnings growth, and we expect that -- or double-digit sales growth. We expect that to continue in 2016. We're excited about really having put all those ACS businesses together, and the demand is there. We have feet on the street, we have marketing resources and we have a leadership team that's working together instead of in 5 or 6 different business silos. That's making a big difference for us. We're going into those Tier 2, Tier 3 cities and it's across. I wouldn't single out any ACS business that's leading any other. So really good comprehensive story, and that will continue. In terms of aerospace, we're in line -- we're mostly an aftermarket business there, as you know. And we're mostly in line with flight hours. That will continue into 2016. The one thing I'll point out there is that there is a lot of flight activity. Consumers are becoming more mobile, but I'd also point out that the airlines are getting smarter, either working together on their inventory levels and like. So that does create a little bit of a headwind for us, but overall, I think, we're okay in aerospace. PMT, it has been a tough year in PMT in China and that's not unlike the rest of the globe. So UOP and HPS both have experienced that. But looking into 2016, we do see some improvement. UOP, I think, should be flat to low single digit. I think HPS will be in that similar range. And aftermarket -- sorry, Advanced Materials will have low single-digit growth as well, particularly from Fluorine Products. So it's -- I'd say, it's stronger than what you're hearing in ACS. I think, in line in Aero, and PMT has got some opportunities and probably a lower baseline of comparison from '15 to '16.\n\n---\n\nTerrific. And just a follow-up question on non-res outlook, you sort of highlighted commercial slowing down a little bit versus 2015. Could you just give a little bit more color there?\n\n---\n\nYes, when you look at 2015, I mean, we did well. But I think, when you look at '16, you look at -- you consider each of the businesses that we've got. So ECC, Security and Fire and Building Solutions. Security and Fire had a great 2015, I mean, up -- it's definitely been the growth for ACS throughout the year. So I think we're being a bit conservative, but not planning on that being as robust as it was throughout the year, but we continue to develop channels and we have nice new products there. In HPS, it's -- we have a very strong service backlog, as you know. But our Projects business, orders wise, has been little bit softer this year, and that gives us visibility into next year that maybe we'll see a little bit of a slower environment there as well. So overall, it's going to be in that kind of 3%, 3.5% kind of growth for commercial, a little bit less than 2015 but nothing significantly different.\n\n---\n\nYes and I would just add to that, Andrew, the other piece we've seen is good growth on the distribution side. So in ADI, throughout '15 and that's based on what we see and expect that will continue into next year as well.\n\n---\n\nTom, this is really helpful detail as well. So -- on Page 9, you talked about conservative planning and other markets being negative 1%, and it's a little bit different. You talked about it as contingency on the call. Is that just the difference between the business unit rollup and your corporate decision to kind of temper it down by contingency? And if so, how -- what was sort of the natural rollup? And how much contingency should I think in there? And what is it? Where are we talking about kind of the most conservatism?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, I think, what we're saying is that if you look at the Honeywell portfolio, we've got maybe 1/3 of it that really has some nice growth prospects.  And that's growing in that 3% to 4% range, and we're fairly confident in what we're seeing there. The other 2/3 of the portfolio, probably, rolls up to something less robust, probably 0% to 1%. And what we're saying is that from a prudency perspective kind of at the corporate level that we believe we need to be a little bit less enthusiastic about both elements. And that -- so I would consider that to be broad contingency as opposed to specific on a particular segment. We've also got some conservatism in the business rollups themselves, I'm sure. But I think the sales line, we feel, knock on wood, if the current market conditions were to remain stable, that we've planned this prudently.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And just so I'm clear as a follow-up there. When I sort of extend that to the 5-year outlook page, the prior 4% to 6%. Obviously, a 3%, 1% and 1% to 2% this year -- or next year, you're talking 7% to 8% just to get the low end and 12% at the high end. So that's going to get updated or you're just saying, I guess in March. Is that how you're thinking about that?\n\n---\n\nYes, we're not going to alter the 5-year plan guidance. We're going to stick to that. We'll continue to aspire to be in that 4% to 6% range, to the extent our markets will allow it. Of course, you rightly point out that the markets haven't allowed it. Particularly, when you look at the headwinds we faced from oil and gas and UOP and HPS. When you have negative growth rates in big business like that it's tough to overcome that to get to the 4% to 6%. But we want to leave it out there. We want that to be the aspiration. That's what our HOS Gold enterprises are using to calibrate their plans.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just on FX, if I could. The $0.15 impact, how much of that is translation, transaction and hedge rolling off? Can you just maybe break that out a little bit for us now?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's a combination of all of it because as we explained in our hedging strategy, last year -- maybe we should update this at the Investor Day. But we take a combination of both transaction exposure and translation exposure, net them out and our hedging is done on that basis. It's the way to think about it.\n\n---\n\nSo maybe starting on just 4Q for a second. I know you call out ACS and PMT as the reasons for the lower growth guide. But anymore color you can provide there, Tom?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, PMT, I would say, when you look at what we guided to, we had some assumptions around some orders in UOP, actually coming in and converting. And despite what I describe as a very robust fourth quarter for UOP orders, and it has been tracking very nicely in the last couple of weeks. Timing of such is that they're not going to commit in a way that's going to enable us to impact 2015 fourth quarter like we had anticipated. So that's, I'd say, the biggest factor in PMT. As far as ACS is concerned, it's not any one significant factor. I mean, I look outside and see the 60-degree weather, I know that's not helpful for our businesses that are in the HVAC side of things as well for our retail business on the safety side. And I'd say, also the overall oil and gas is benefactor on demand. It's tempered that more than we had anticipated. So that's the color we have right now.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That's helpful, Tom. I guess, my one follow-up question, and I know that you guys have made some conservative planning assumptions on the growth side for next year. But if the conversion of some of that backlog continues to get deferred, it seems like you can still make some pretty good cost adjustments to hit the higher end of your numbers. I'm just curious maybe you can just kind of comment on that? And also, maybe discuss what that means relative to the investments that you're making across your businesses as well? Because there's some sense from the investment community or some concern that you could be pulling forward earnings in the near term at the cost of sacrificing future returns.\n\n---\n\nYes, well, I mean, I'd like to dispel that notion. When Dave does his reviews of AOP and STRAP, that's the first thing he's looking at is growth investments, whether it's in technology or high-growth regions, new products, that's his focus. We're basically not allowed to reduce and anywhere that there's headcount adds it is in R&D, sales and marketing, so the front end of the business. So if you look at it from a numerical perspective, we are still at that 7% of our sales that we've talked about. So that's not how we're doing it. To answer your question about what happens if we're at the lower end of our growth range, we think our guidance contemplates that with that 6% to 10%. We've also got some contingency built into even that if you say that 6% because we've got robust restructuring. With the $125 million increase in pension income, we'll get $125 million more in restructuring as well. And don't forget, when you study our EPS walk, you'll see that the restructuring this year doesn't go away. So the contemplation is that what we would've funded this year, the $100-plus million, will also be in place next year. So you have a very robust pipeline of restructuring as well that we can work with, again, in the case that sales don't materialize to where what we thought. So we feel comfortable with it. I mean, if the world falls apart, that's a different story. But in this environment, if it kind of stays -- if our markets that we serve stay sort of in the state that they're in today and we feel very comfortable with the amount of contingency that we have.\n\n---\n\nA lot of ground covered. Just a couple of quick things from me. Just back to aerospares and aftermarket in general, Tom. Have you guys -- I mean, obviously the forecast of kind of trimming your sales a little bit so to speak on growth there relative to industry trends to reflect parts harvesting and inventory collaboration and the like makes a heck of a lot of sense. But I'm wondering if you've actually been able to quantify that. Is this kind of a plausible gut estimate on where this stuff is at? Or have you really been able to kind of demographically work through the fleets and what's been retired and what might be harvested? And where these airlines are in the process of kind of paring inventory and sharing inventory?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, certainly, all those factors are considered when we arrive at our growth rates. I mean, we, of course, consider North America is the most efficient when it comes to airline efficiency. But the high-growth regions, whether it's India, China or wherever, are trying to pattern themselves after what you see in North America. So those management techniques around spare parts, around aircraft turnaround time, around inventory levels, certainly finding their way to those other markets. We're prepared with it, we're dealing with it and our growth rates do contemplate that.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just one other one just to get totally baselined on UOP. So how much has UOP been down for 2015? And typically, how much of your forward -- your sales are kind of backlog-dependent versus kind of licensing and other kind of flow things that might happen over the course of the year?\n\n---\n\nYes, so from a revenue perspective, UOP for '15 will be down mid-single digits, and that's going to be comparable for 2016 is the way I'd say it. And then when you think about the different elements of UOP, I'd say the catalysts we do expect to continue over the course of the year. It's a very lumpy business, so you -- maybe you won't see it in the first quarter. But we think catalysts that are at sort of a record level now will kind of stay at that level. So you won't see significant growth there, but we'll continue to see some equipment declines across the portfolio and overall that low single-digit decline or mid-single-digit decline.\n\n---\n\nA couple of cleanup questions. So.\r\n[Technical Difficulty]\n\n---\n\nYou hear me now?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nSorry about that. Just on the topic of restructuring plans for the year and we know it's being offset with pension, but what would be the cadence of the restructuring actions for the quarters? And I doubt it's going to be neatly offset for pension. Might there be some quarters with negative restructuring?\n\n---\n\nI can't -- I wouldn't rule that out, Dean, but I wouldn't say that that's probably a likely outcome. When you look at the timing of Elster, I wouldn't expect to have much restructuring in the first quarter, given the recency of the closing. But I do think, if you look at a cadence perspective, I think starting the second and really ramping up in the second half, you'd see more of that restructuring related to the M&A. And then we'd have our ongoing HOS Gold-related restructuring identification opportunities throughout the course of the year.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then just one other one on the free cash flow conversion at 90%. What has to change to get to that benchmark 100? I know you've got some outsized CapEx coming up, but you also mentioned working capital initiatives.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think it's those 2 things precisely. Working capital -- sorry, CapEx, we're still 1.5x, 1.6x our rate of depreciation, and that starts to taper off in the second half of 2016. And it's then that you'll start to see the attendant improvement in free cash flow. But I would also want to just take a second and emphasize that the surge in CapEx that you're seeing is really very attractive opportunity that I consider akin to M&A. In fact, the returns on the projects, if you look through them, whether it's the Catalysts projects in UOP or you look at the Fluorine Projects to add the production for mobile air-conditioning and the like, the returns on those are very, very attractive, like north of 30%. And we hit 80% run rate when we open those plants. I can't find an acquisition that would ever give me those kinds of returns. So it's very, very attractive. And it's just an unfortunate accounting requirement that the CapEx has to go against free cash flow but M&A doesn't. I see it as strong as M&A. So we feel while we want to get to 100% conversion, we're going to continue to pursue attractive opportunities like this that may put us in periods of decline. On working capital, we have opportunity, and we are going after it hard. Like we'll have a great fourth quarter when it comes to working capital, as an example. I would say that our working capital is adversely impacted by the declines in backlogs that we have in our long-cycle businesses. A lot of those backlogs come with advances. So you get the cash and that -- you're holding the cash that is an offset to your working capital. But when I look at Honeywell's working capital performance compared to our peer group, when you normalize it for advances and the like, we've actually performed very, very well in total working capital. I'm not trying to say there's more opportunity, but I think when you benchmark it we've done really well. But a lot of opportunities I've said, particularly, in our most inefficient business when it comes to the industry and the supply chain in aero and we are really hard at work trying to make some differences there. Those will be the 2, Deane: the CapEx, which I think is really a positive story for us, and working capital also positive.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Alicia. This concludes our outlook call. As always, we're available throughout the day for any follow-up. So thank you, and have a wonderful holiday season.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Scott Davis (Analysts)】\nCongrats on the good finish of '15. First, I mean you really picked up the deal flow this year and pretty interesting transactions and you talked about still having some balance sheet firepower. I mean you put $5.5 billion to work this year, and presumably the M&A market maybe gets a little bit better in the next year even than it's been in the last. I mean what kind of firepower are we talking that you'd be comfortable and putting to work?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nTo be honest with you, Scott, I don't think it's changed that much from what we've talked about before. I mean, we're generating close to $5 billion in cash a year that we can put to work before CapEx. So to the extent we lever and we've added -- we will have added a little bit more debt for Elster, we can quickly delever. So it's that strong cash flow, it's that solid balance sheet, the capacity is strong and we're not really limiting ourselves in any way, shape or form. And the businesses have very robust pipelines, so I...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Davis (Analysts)】\nSomething in the neighborhood of another $5.5 billion year is possible? Is that -- I hate to pin you down on numbers, but trying to think in terms of what you guys think is...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, I wouldn't want to commit to that, but that's always possible. Knowing what's in our pipeline, I could easily see that happening.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Davis (Analysts)】\nAnd then, just as a follow-up, UOP has been a business, I think many of us probably have struggled to model. How does it stress test at $30 oil and $2 gas? I see your assumptions, but certainly your $45 to $55 oil number, I don't see a gas assumption here. But how does that business, at least historically, stand up at these types of commodity levels? Or just -- I've been told sometimes it doesn't correlate, and I struggle to understand that too. So maybe you could explain how you guys think about it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nThe way I'm looking at it is that you have to look at where UOP is positioned in that whole energy segment. So mostly in that mid- and downstream. And when you think of the customers it's serving, whether it's gas pipelines or refineries or petrochemical plants, they're all operating. And they're operating well. And so they need, certainly, the support from aftermarket on catalysts. And you're seeing that this year. We've got significant catalyst activity, which is a high-profit business for us. I think also you'll start to see the need for more equipment as these downstream operations need to come offline for maintenance. So I think it will hold in. What we've got planned for 2016, I think, reflects still a tough environment and it will be down mid-single digits in '16, but the profitability of business holds up pretty well given the conditions I described.\n\n---\n\n【質問: C. Stephen Tusa (Analysts)】\nCan you just walk through the Elster dynamics? I think something in kind of a low single-digit range for the margin there, and I assume that's all encapsulated in ACS. Is there any related restructuring that's coming in below the line in the restructuring segment? I just wanted to kind of be clear on the Elster geography and then just at the end, the related accretion. It sounds like you're calling for a little bit of accretion here versus the no impact prior.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nRight. So just to make it clear, Steve, I won't get the exact numbers right, but if it's a $2 billion portfolio, about $1.7 billion or so ends up in ACS. The gas processing business in Elster goes to HPS, which is in PMT. But with that said, the margin rates of Elster, as you know, are quite attractive on their own. And in the -- but in the first year, we typically get that M&A-related dilution in the margins from purchase accounting with the one-time write-offs as well as the cost of the integration team. We will fund the required restructuring for Elster on an ongoing basis. So the restructuring provisions that we've got in the plan for 2016 that we've described, the part that offsets the increase in the pension income, that in part, will be used for Elster. But I just want to emphasize that our visibility on the precise integration plan is not much deeper than when we first announced the deal because it's a public company, and we've been kept at the appropriate arm's length. But as soon as it closes, which we expect to be shortly here, we'll be putting those restructuring plans together and hoping -- putting to work the restructuring slots [ph] that were in the plan.\n\n---\n\n【質問: C. Stephen Tusa (Analysts)】\nOkay. So deal charge is above the line, related restructuring to get the synergies as part of your total below the line restructuring number?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nThat's the way to think about it, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: C. Stephen Tusa (Analysts)】\nAnd then one last quick question. You guys spent about $1.9 billion on buyback this year, and your calling for share count to be flat next year. What's going on there? Because in the presentation, when you guys talk about deploying capital and every $1 billion represents $0.10 of earnings or whatever, I mean, it's not like the stock has been a barn-burner this year. So I'm not sure what's going on with options. But I mean, is that just conservatism? Is there math around there that I'm missing on -- is there more dilution expected? It just seems like an awful lot of spending for no benefit.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes. Let me explain how we built the plan, Steve. We've historically said and actually operated on the same basis, which is to keep our share count flat. And so what we've done from a share buyback perspective, on an ongoing basis, is really just to buy sufficient shares to offset the dilution from the option exercises that you referred to as well as contributions to our other benefit plans. In the third -- towards the tail end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter when we saw some market disruptions, there were some buying opportunities for us. And we looked ahead at the dilution that we know is coming in the fourth quarter, in the first quarter and the second quarter and said, we can buy ahead for those -- for that expected dilution. So it's -- we think of it as getting ahead of ourselves on dilution when we see opportunistic market conditions, and that's how we're going to approach it. So with that, we've got an acceleration of buyback, and if we've already offset dilution in the third quarter, fourth quarter and first quarter, the subsequent exercises in contributions will moderate that share count back to 2015 levels.\n\n---\n\n【質問: C. Stephen Tusa (Analysts)】\nOkay. So it's like -- so there's, essentially, some freed up capital, I guess, is what you're saying relative to what you usually do going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nNo -- well, I mean, let's put it this way. If -- say we were -- say we didn't see market conditions in a way that we would consider opportunistic. We wouldn't really engage in the share buyback activity that you've seen us do historically, because we've already covered the dilution for the fourth quarter, the first quarter, the second quarter -- actually through most of 2016. However, that's not to say that if there were more opportunities in the market, that we wouldn't jump back in and go after, opportunistically, those opportunities.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nigel Coe (Analysts)】\nSo tell me, you mentioned -- I think you mentioned $0.40, $0.50 long-term accretion from Elster once this fully embedded, et cetera. How is the profile on getting to that number? Because obviously, '16 has been impacted by deal charges, restructuring, et cetera. Do we get sort of into a $0.25, $0.30 range in '17? And I'm not looking for '17 guidance here but I'm just thinking about the profile to get to that kind of level of accretion.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, first of all, I want to be clear that, that $0.40 to $0.50 was on an amortization and purchase accounting adjusted basis. So when you factor in the amortization, that will bring that accretion down a bit. But with that said, we're going to be, knock on wood, hopefully, getting to work earlier on trying to drive some of those synergies. And the biggest ones are on the sourcing side as you would imagine. So day one as soon as this thing closes, which we're on the cusp of, we'll be engaging and that will be the primary basis for driving that accretion in Elster. Of course, as we -- as our integration teams get into the operation of the supply chain, the back office and so forth, those activities tend to lag a little bit, but those will continue to be a contributor to that ongoing improvement in Elster. Not ready yet to say what the '17 impact will be because, again, we're sort of early days in terms of the detailed visibility we need to make those assessments.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nigel Coe (Analysts)】\nYes, fair enough. And then just wanted to dig into your comments about the HPS backlog momentum. Can you maybe just give some color on where you're seeing that -- some momentum, where you're seeing projects starting to break free. Perhaps the kinds of profiles, refineries versus -- refinery versus maybe downstream chemical. Where you are seeing that momentum, Tom?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nI'd say it's across the various verticals. Remember, HPS serves more than just the oil and gas vertical. And so if you think of a little bit of upstream, midstream as well as the downstream core DCS, we're seeing it across. We've gotten a couple of nice megaproject orders as well that have contributed to that backlog. I'd say, outside of the U.S. probably growing stronger than inside the U.S. from a backlog perspective.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nigel Coe (Analysts)】\nOkay. A quick clarification on the UOP backlog. You mentioned down less than 10%. Is that organic? Or is that in dollar terms?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, that's organic. Yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Macaluso (Executives)】\nThat's organic, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Obin (Analysts)】\nJust a question, could you give us some more detailed view on what you are guys seeing in emerging markets and, specifically, China? Just a lot of conflicting data coming out of the region.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, that's a good question. For us, we've had some really strong results in ACS China as we talked about. As we've -- so 2015, when you look at ACS, it's been good double-digit earnings growth, and we expect that -- or double-digit sales growth. We expect that to continue in 2016. We're excited about really having put all those ACS businesses together, and the demand is there. We have feet on the street, we have marketing resources and we have a leadership team that's working together instead of in 5 or 6 different business silos. That's making a big difference for us. We're going into those Tier 2, Tier 3 cities and it's across. I wouldn't single out any ACS business that's leading any other. So really good comprehensive story, and that will continue. In terms of aerospace, we're in line -- we're mostly an aftermarket business there, as you know. And we're mostly in line with flight hours. That will continue into 2016. The one thing I'll point out there is that there is a lot of flight activity. Consumers are becoming more mobile, but I'd also point out that the airlines are getting smarter, either working together on their inventory levels and like. So that does create a little bit of a headwind for us, but overall, I think, we're okay in aerospace. PMT, it has been a tough year in PMT in China and that's not unlike the rest of the globe. So UOP and HPS both have experienced that. But looking into 2016, we do see some improvement. UOP, I think, should be flat to low single digit. I think HPS will be in that similar range. And aftermarket -- sorry, Advanced Materials will have low single-digit growth as well, particularly from Fluorine Products. So it's -- I'd say, it's stronger than what you're hearing in ACS. I think, in line in Aero, and PMT has got some opportunities and probably a lower baseline of comparison from '15 to '16.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Obin (Analysts)】\nTerrific. And just a follow-up question on non-res outlook, you sort of highlighted commercial slowing down a little bit versus 2015. Could you just give a little bit more color there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, when you look at 2015, I mean, we did well. But I think, when you look at '16, you look at -- you consider each of the businesses that we've got. So ECC, Security and Fire and Building Solutions. Security and Fire had a great 2015, I mean, up -- it's definitely been the growth for ACS throughout the year. So I think we're being a bit conservative, but not planning on that being as robust as it was throughout the year, but we continue to develop channels and we have nice new products there. In HPS, it's -- we have a very strong service backlog, as you know. But our Projects business, orders wise, has been little bit softer this year, and that gives us visibility into next year that maybe we'll see a little bit of a slower environment there as well. So overall, it's going to be in that kind of 3%, 3.5% kind of growth for commercial, a little bit less than 2015 but nothing significantly different.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Macaluso (Executives)】\nYes and I would just add to that, Andrew, the other piece we've seen is good growth on the distribution side. So in ADI, throughout '15 and that's based on what we see and expect that will continue into next year as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Winoker (Analysts)】\nTom, this is really helpful detail as well. So -- on Page 9, you talked about conservative planning and other markets being negative 1%, and it's a little bit different. You talked about it as contingency on the call. Is that just the difference between the business unit rollup and your corporate decision to kind of temper it down by contingency? And if so, how -- what was sort of the natural rollup? And how much contingency should I think in there? And what is it? Where are we talking about kind of the most conservatism?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, I think, what we're saying is that if you look at the Honeywell portfolio, we've got maybe 1/3 of it that really has some nice growth prospects.  And that's growing in that 3% to 4% range, and we're fairly confident in what we're seeing there. The other 2/3 of the portfolio, probably, rolls up to something less robust, probably 0% to 1%. And what we're saying is that from a prudency perspective kind of at the corporate level that we believe we need to be a little bit less enthusiastic about both elements. And that -- so I would consider that to be broad contingency as opposed to specific on a particular segment. We've also got some conservatism in the business rollups themselves, I'm sure. But I think the sales line, we feel, knock on wood, if the current market conditions were to remain stable, that we've planned this prudently.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Winoker (Analysts)】\nGreat. And just so I'm clear as a follow-up there. When I sort of extend that to the 5-year outlook page, the prior 4% to 6%. Obviously, a 3%, 1% and 1% to 2% this year -- or next year, you're talking 7% to 8% just to get the low end and 12% at the high end. So that's going to get updated or you're just saying, I guess in March. Is that how you're thinking about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, we're not going to alter the 5-year plan guidance. We're going to stick to that. We'll continue to aspire to be in that 4% to 6% range, to the extent our markets will allow it. Of course, you rightly point out that the markets haven't allowed it. Particularly, when you look at the headwinds we faced from oil and gas and UOP and HPS. When you have negative growth rates in big business like that it's tough to overcome that to get to the 4% to 6%. But we want to leave it out there. We want that to be the aspiration. That's what our HOS Gold enterprises are using to calibrate their plans.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Winoker (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just on FX, if I could. The $0.15 impact, how much of that is translation, transaction and hedge rolling off? Can you just maybe break that out a little bit for us now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, it's a combination of all of it because as we explained in our hedging strategy, last year -- maybe we should update this at the Investor Day. But we take a combination of both transaction exposure and translation exposure, net them out and our hedging is done on that basis. It's the way to think about it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Ritchie (Analysts)】\nSo maybe starting on just 4Q for a second. I know you call out ACS and PMT as the reasons for the lower growth guide. But anymore color you can provide there, Tom?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, PMT, I would say, when you look at what we guided to, we had some assumptions around some orders in UOP, actually coming in and converting. And despite what I describe as a very robust fourth quarter for UOP orders, and it has been tracking very nicely in the last couple of weeks. Timing of such is that they're not going to commit in a way that's going to enable us to impact 2015 fourth quarter like we had anticipated. So that's, I'd say, the biggest factor in PMT. As far as ACS is concerned, it's not any one significant factor. I mean, I look outside and see the 60-degree weather, I know that's not helpful for our businesses that are in the HVAC side of things as well for our retail business on the safety side. And I'd say, also the overall oil and gas is benefactor on demand. It's tempered that more than we had anticipated. So that's the color we have right now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Ritchie (Analysts)】\nOkay. That's helpful, Tom. I guess, my one follow-up question, and I know that you guys have made some conservative planning assumptions on the growth side for next year. But if the conversion of some of that backlog continues to get deferred, it seems like you can still make some pretty good cost adjustments to hit the higher end of your numbers. I'm just curious maybe you can just kind of comment on that? And also, maybe discuss what that means relative to the investments that you're making across your businesses as well? Because there's some sense from the investment community or some concern that you could be pulling forward earnings in the near term at the cost of sacrificing future returns.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, well, I mean, I'd like to dispel that notion. When Dave does his reviews of AOP and STRAP, that's the first thing he's looking at is growth investments, whether it's in technology or high-growth regions, new products, that's his focus. We're basically not allowed to reduce and anywhere that there's headcount adds it is in R&D, sales and marketing, so the front end of the business. So if you look at it from a numerical perspective, we are still at that 7% of our sales that we've talked about. So that's not how we're doing it. To answer your question about what happens if we're at the lower end of our growth range, we think our guidance contemplates that with that 6% to 10%. We've also got some contingency built into even that if you say that 6% because we've got robust restructuring. With the $125 million increase in pension income, we'll get $125 million more in restructuring as well. And don't forget, when you study our EPS walk, you'll see that the restructuring this year doesn't go away. So the contemplation is that what we would've funded this year, the $100-plus million, will also be in place next year. So you have a very robust pipeline of restructuring as well that we can work with, again, in the case that sales don't materialize to where what we thought. So we feel comfortable with it. I mean, if the world falls apart, that's a different story. But in this environment, if it kind of stays -- if our markets that we serve stay sort of in the state that they're in today and we feel very comfortable with the amount of contingency that we have.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Sprague (Analysts)】\nA lot of ground covered. Just a couple of quick things from me. Just back to aerospares and aftermarket in general, Tom. Have you guys -- I mean, obviously the forecast of kind of trimming your sales a little bit so to speak on growth there relative to industry trends to reflect parts harvesting and inventory collaboration and the like makes a heck of a lot of sense. But I'm wondering if you've actually been able to quantify that. Is this kind of a plausible gut estimate on where this stuff is at? Or have you really been able to kind of demographically work through the fleets and what's been retired and what might be harvested? And where these airlines are in the process of kind of paring inventory and sharing inventory?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, certainly, all those factors are considered when we arrive at our growth rates. I mean, we, of course, consider North America is the most efficient when it comes to airline efficiency. But the high-growth regions, whether it's India, China or wherever, are trying to pattern themselves after what you see in North America. So those management techniques around spare parts, around aircraft turnaround time, around inventory levels, certainly finding their way to those other markets. We're prepared with it, we're dealing with it and our growth rates do contemplate that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Sprague (Analysts)】\nAnd then just one other one just to get totally baselined on UOP. So how much has UOP been down for 2015? And typically, how much of your forward -- your sales are kind of backlog-dependent versus kind of licensing and other kind of flow things that might happen over the course of the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, so from a revenue perspective, UOP for '15 will be down mid-single digits, and that's going to be comparable for 2016 is the way I'd say it. And then when you think about the different elements of UOP, I'd say the catalysts we do expect to continue over the course of the year. It's a very lumpy business, so you -- maybe you won't see it in the first quarter. But we think catalysts that are at sort of a record level now will kind of stay at that level. So you won't see significant growth there, but we'll continue to see some equipment declines across the portfolio and overall that low single-digit decline or mid-single-digit decline.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Deane Dray (Analysts)】\nA couple of cleanup questions. So.\r\n[Technical Difficulty]\n\n---\n\n【質問: Deane Dray (Analysts)】\nYou hear me now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Deane Dray (Analysts)】\nSorry about that. Just on the topic of restructuring plans for the year and we know it's being offset with pension, but what would be the cadence of the restructuring actions for the quarters? And I doubt it's going to be neatly offset for pension. Might there be some quarters with negative restructuring?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nI can't -- I wouldn't rule that out, Dean, but I wouldn't say that that's probably a likely outcome. When you look at the timing of Elster, I wouldn't expect to have much restructuring in the first quarter, given the recency of the closing. But I do think, if you look at a cadence perspective, I think starting the second and really ramping up in the second half, you'd see more of that restructuring related to the M&A. And then we'd have our ongoing HOS Gold-related restructuring identification opportunities throughout the course of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Deane Dray (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then just one other one on the free cash flow conversion at 90%. What has to change to get to that benchmark 100? I know you've got some outsized CapEx coming up, but you also mentioned working capital initiatives.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Thomas Szlosek (Executives)】\nYes, I think it's those 2 things precisely. Working capital -- sorry, CapEx, we're still 1.5x, 1.6x our rate of depreciation, and that starts to taper off in the second half of 2016. And it's then that you'll start to see the attendant improvement in free cash flow. But I would also want to just take a second and emphasize that the surge in CapEx that you're seeing is really very attractive opportunity that I consider akin to M&A. In fact, the returns on the projects, if you look through them, whether it's the Catalysts projects in UOP or you look at the Fluorine Projects to add the production for mobile air-conditioning and the like, the returns on those are very, very attractive, like north of 30%. And we hit 80% run rate when we open those plants. I can't find an acquisition that would ever give me those kinds of returns. So it's very, very attractive. And it's just an unfortunate accounting requirement that the CapEx has to go against free cash flow but M&A doesn't. I see it as strong as M&A. So we feel while we want to get to 100% conversion, we're going to continue to pursue attractive opportunities like this that may put us in periods of decline. On working capital, we have opportunity, and we are going after it hard. Like we'll have a great fourth quarter when it comes to working capital, as an example. I would say that our working capital is adversely impacted by the declines in backlogs that we have in our long-cycle businesses. A lot of those backlogs come with advances. So you get the cash and that -- you're holding the cash that is an offset to your working capital. But when I look at Honeywell's working capital performance compared to our peer group, when you normalize it for advances and the like, we've actually performed very, very well in total working capital. I'm not trying to say there's more opportunity, but I think when you benchmark it we've done really well. But a lot of opportunities I've said, particularly, in our most inefficient business when it comes to the industry and the supply chain in aero and we are really hard at work trying to make some differences there. Those will be the 2, Deane: the CapEx, which I think is really a positive story for us, and working capital also positive.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Macaluso (Executives)】\nThanks, Alicia. This concludes our outlook call. As always, we're available throughout the day for any follow-up. So thank you, and have a wonderful holiday season.",

Joining me this morning from the U.S. is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President of Aflac Incorporated; Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated; Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S.; and Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Investment Officer. Also from Tokyo joining us today is Paul Amos, President of Aflac; Hiroshi Yamauchi, President and COO of Aflac Japan.\r\nBefore we start, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they're prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at these quarterly earnings releases from some of our -- for some of the various risk factors that can materially impact our results.\r\nNow I'll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some high-level comments and outlines of the company's strategic vision; then Paul will provide the strategic focus for our Japan operations and outlook; Teresa will give an update on the U.S. strategy and focus; and Fred will follow up with comments about our capital management strategy and financial outlook; and then Dan will follow up at the end. Dan?\n\n---\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. Many of you probably heard me speak about the importance of the promises that we make to our policyholders and being there when they need us most. Today, we're going to share with you our outlook for 2016. But before we do that, I'd like to share Aflac's strategic vision: to offer higher-quality voluntary products, solutions and services through diverse distribution outlets. In doing so, we are ultimately building upon our market-leading position to drive long-term shareholder value.\r\nAt Aflac, we've always managed our business for the long term while maintaining a sharp focus on the financial objectives. At the same time, we continue to work on enhancing our customer service and building our book of business. In doing so, we successfully established strategic points of leverage in both Japan and the United States that we will use to grow and drive shareholder value.\r\nOur industry-leading market share and scale in both Japan and the United States drive our administrative efficiencies. This allows us to offer affordable and value coverage to our customers and competitive compensation to our distributors. At the same time, it drives value for our shareholders. Leveraging our leading position in both countries will help position us for growth going forward.\r\nAs product innovators, we've experienced a tremendous amount of success in leveraging the strength of Aflac's recognition and powerful brand to drive sales. About 9 out of 10 people in both countries recognize the Aflac brand. Our brand is a combination of many elements, with the most visible being the Aflac Duck. But it's also made up of trust that we build through relationships with businesses, the policyholders and consumers. In Japan and the U.S., Aflac's established brand has served as an effective door opener. In turn, this serves as a catalyst for customers to be more receptive to hearing how Aflac's products can help them. As just one example, in the United States, One Day Pay, our industry-leading claims initiative, allows us to process, approve and pay eligible claims in just 1 day. Our policyholders and consumers continue to tell us how our commitment to paying claims fast through One Day Pay underscores Aflac's integrity and commitment to delivering on our promise.\r\nHaving diverse and productive distribution channels is a strategic point of leverage and a vital component of our growth strategy in Japan and in the United States. As such, this is one area that we focus a great deal of our efforts. Our goal is to have a presence in all outlets where consumers in both countries want to make their insurance purchasing [ph] decisions. We offer innovative products and high-quality customized service to provide businesses and their employees with solutions that protect financial well-being.\r\nWe've established a strong capital position with stable earnings and cash flow. Our capital ratios demonstrate our commitment to maintain strong capital levels and flexibility on behalf of our policyholders, bondholders and shareholders. We also regularly assess our capital adequacy to ensure we maintain strong, even under economic scenarios.\r\nNow let me turn the program over to Paul, who will talk about Aflac Japan. Paul?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Dan. Japan faces the unprecedented challenges of keeping its economy running against the backdrop of social change and reform. As you are aware, the Japanese economy has recently dipped into a technical recession. At the same time, Japan's government is under increasing financial strain to support a growing number of retirees. Given Japan's aging population, declining birth rate and rising medical treatment cost, their health care system has been under increasing financial pressure. These factors present an opportunity. As health-related expenditures continue to grow, so does the need for insurance across all ages, especially the type of products we offer, insurance for daily living. We believe Aflac's products are more vital than ever before, and we are committed to being there for our policyholders in their time of need.\r\nAnother factor of social change in Japan relates to womenomics or the increased participation of women in the workforce. Womenomics represents the primary way the government is attempting to address challenges of a shrinking workforce. At Aflac Japan, diversity management is an integrable part of our overall management strategy. For example, last year, we implemented a comprehensive leadership initiative called the women's empowerment program, and we are working to raise the percentage of leadership positions held by women. Research from various sources, including McKinsey consulting, has proven that diverse organizations deliver better financial results, which will impact both Japan's economy and continue to help Aflac Japan.\r\nTurning to the third sector market. With many insurance companies seeing growth opportunities, the landscape remains competitive. While the number of competitors has decreased, medical product competitiveness is on the rise with an increasing variety of products that have shorter life cycles. At the same time, the ongoing low interest rate environment has created changes in the first sector marketplace. Amid this evolving market environment, Aflac is determined to maintain and further expand its position as the leading insurance company in Japan's third sector market by providing solutions for our policyholders as they face a heavy financial burden related to health care cost. In 2015, Aflac Japan significantly expanded its third sector product sales and distribution. Notably, we've strengthened our relationship with Japan Post Holdings.\r\nWith respect to third sector products, you will recall at the end of 2014, Aflac Japan introduced the latest version through our cancer product line, New Cancer DAYS, and its strong momentum continued into 2015 across all distribution channels. Then in June 2015, we enhanced our EVER medical insurance with the introduction of riders related to critical illnesses. As we have experienced in the past, the launch of these 2 significant products served to boost sales in 2015. We anticipate that in 2016, the new product schedule will focus on product refinements, including the potential to enter a new area of the third sector market.\r\nIn terms of first sector products, the market is further segmented as the level-premium protection oriented products are largely sold in traditional channels and lump sum savings-oriented products are popular in the bank channel. We are refining our approach and will concentrate on level-premium products for cross-selling and stability of returns. The goal is to split the sector into those products that we want to sell based on their characteristics, profitability and limited capital strain. The low interest rate environment has impacted our view on selling first sector products. And the action we took in 2012 in terms of limiting the sale of WAYS, for instance, was the right path for us to take. Going forward, we believe the sale of level-premium products not only enhances the sale of third sector products through cross-selling, but importantly, the product profitability of a level-premium product is more stable, with returns that exceed our cost of capital and benefit from the cross-sell of higher-return third sector products.\r\nGiven the very strong sales growth in the first 9 months and our expectation for the remainder of the year, we now anticipate that 2015 sales growth for third sector products will be at the high end of the 10% to 13% range. The successful launch of 2 products in the cancer and health lines creates difficult 2015 sales comparison. As such, we anticipate third sector sales in 2016 will be down mid-single digit. While these results from 2015 create a tough comparison, we are looking to drive a compound annual growth rate for third sector product in the range of 4% to 6% over the long term. We believe that a continued revision and expansion of our third sector product line will aid in achieving this objective.\r\nWith respect to first sector sales, 2016 will be a year of transition, making specific guidance more challenging. We expect our proactive approach will drive lump sum product sales down considerably, while level-premium product will essentially track third sector sales down modestly during the year. Recognizing we have an Aflac policy in 1 out of 4 households in Japan, we pay careful attention to the social change and have a track record of developing products and solutions to meet the evolving need of our customers.\r\nThank you, and now let me turn it over to Teresa White, who will be covering Aflac U.S.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Paul. I'd like to begin by sharing some highlights of what we're observing in the U.S. market, much of which has been impacted by the Affordable Care Act, or ACA. We continue to see employers opt for high-deductible health plans to reduce expenses associated with offering employee benefit. Although small employers, meaning those fewer than 50 employees, are not required to offer major medical, they continue to look for ways to assist their employees with health coverage. In addition, mid to large employers are still overwhelmed by the regulatory aspects of ACA. These employers are seeking ways to make coverage affordable while, at the same time, reduce the administrative burden of the regulations. Nevertheless, workers continue to look to employers for health care solutions, especially since 52% of U.S. workers can't even afford $1,000 in out-of-pocket expenses. This dynamic has caused many brokers to look to voluntary to help their clients fill gaps brought by a high-deductible health plan.\r\nFrom a competitive standpoint, the U.S. market remains very dynamic and has been subject to continual change. Group players are entering the voluntary market by either shifting some of their employer-paid offerings to voluntary or creating voluntary products of their own. The ACA has introduced new rules and greater complexity, especially in HR processes, which have led to an increased administrative burden to the employer. In response, this has prompted a renewed focus on technology to help with decision support, HR benefits enrollment, and to help employees to navigate the complex health care system. This environment creates additional opportunities for Aflac, which leads me to our strategic playbook for 2016.\r\nNow as a backdrop, our goal in 2015 was to build out our 2-channel distribution model more specifically by clarifying roles within each channel. Historically, these channels have competed, which created channel conflict. To manage this, we've leveraged the strength of each channel. We've been focusing our career agents on the smaller employers since they typically enjoy the most success by serving employers with less than 50 employees. Here, we're using everwell to drive growth, and I'll talk a little bit more about this in a few minutes. For the mid- to large-case market, we're attracting more brokers than ever before. In fact, the strong performance in many of our successful market operations is due in part to increased collaboration between brokers and career agents. We've made great strides and now have one of the more dynamic value-add distribution models in the industry, which gives us the potential to be unstoppable.\r\nLooking to 2016, we'll continue to focus on enhancing the productivity of our sales distribution. The Affordable Care Act has opened up 2 opportunities for Aflac to fill gaps created by the high-deductible health plans: first, gaps in ACA coverage have allowed us to position Aflac products alongside major medical as a holistic solution; and everwell allows our agents to take a consultative approach to offer this comprehensive solution of major medical and voluntary products to the small-case market. Therefore, we'll continue to focus on recruiting career agents, training them and promoting the use of everwell to support growth in this segment. In addition, as more brokers have entered the voluntary market, we continue to deepen existing relationships with our broker partners who serve the mid- to large-case segment by providing tools and services to support broker needs, such as proposal management tools, improved underwriting systems and enrollment integration.\r\nAs Dan mentioned, One Day Pay will continue to be a key differentiator for us, especially as some of the major medical players have entered the voluntary market. Despite these new entrants, we believe One Day Pay, our industry-leading claim initiative, stands out to consumers because it gets cash in the hands of those consumers when they need it the most. We'll continue to promote One Day Pay to the consumer as we feel that this will help drive increased brand loyalty and account penetration.\r\nLastly, as the voluntary market continues to grow, with the broker channel group products growing at a faster rate, scale and efficiency will become increasingly important. Although we have made some investments in our platform to support our broker partners, we need to make additional technology investments to support continued growth while enhancing persistency and efficiency of the business.\r\nLooking ahead, keep in mind that as our production through brokers grow, we anticipate sales will be increasingly concentrated in the fourth quarter, more specifically the last 4 weeks of the year. In addition, this is the first full year in which the broker sales forecasting model has been in play. We continue to believe that we're on track to meet the lower end of the 3% to 7% range in the U.S. in 2015, and we're assuming that all of the enrollments that are expected will proceed as planned at the end of the year. Now as we look to 2016, we believe sales will increase in the range of 3% to 7%. The voluntary work-site market is currently projected to grow at 5% over the next 3 years. And as you know, we won't be satisfied until we're growing at or above industry rate.\r\nThank you. And now let me turn the call over to Fred.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Teresa. Let me start with a few of the key areas we are focused on in terms of financial management as we enter 2016. We continue to execute on our general account investment strategy, expanding into new asset classes and mandating external managers where we lack the expertise. In terms of core asset classes, we added middle market loans over the last year and are in the process of building out a commercial loan portfolio, and we'll initiate a modest investment in equities in the next few weeks. Additionally, in the coming years, we will take a measured approach to adding growth assets, which include public and private equity, hedge funds and other alterative asset classes that are both consistent with our liability structure and industry practices. This is a slow ramp-up, with growth in assets expected to reach roughly $3 billion in 2017. We expect these new asset classes will add significant excess investment income in the long term, recognizing we will incur near-term expenses during the building process.\r\nIn terms of risk management, we are working to reduce potential volatility in Aflac Japan's regulatory solvency margin ratio, or SMR, which is sensitive to interest rates, spreads and exchange rates. Reducing volatility allows for greater clarity in identifying excess capital, improves consistency in free cash flow generation, and ultimately drives a lower risk profile in cost of capital.\r\nMeasuring our excess capital position includes a block-by-block assessment of the regulatory reserves in Japan and associated reinsurance capacity, testing regulatory capital measures under stress conditions and comprehensive economic capital analysis. We have successfully used reinsurance in the past to unlock excess capital in Japan. We also believe excess capital exists in the U.S. when considering stability and low-risk profile of our business model.\r\nImportantly, we do not see any change in our core principles surrounding risk and capital management. In accordance with our risk appetite, we will maintain strong SMR and RBC ratios at a minimum range of 500% to 600%, leverage at or below 24% and hold roughly $500 million in excess capital and liquidity at the holding company at all times. The plug-in [ph] priorities include supporting our dividend growth track record and a bias towards repurchasing our stock absent compelling alternatives.\r\nTurning to Slide 17 and a discussion of assumptions underlying our 2016 earnings drivers. We expect stability in our core margins. Consistent with comments on our third quarter earnings call, we expect premium growth rates in the low single digits, supported by stable persistency in our sales outlook. Note that Japan premium is somewhat impacted by the combination of reinsurance, the effect of limited pay products reaching paid-up status, and steady decline in first sector sales as we further refine our strategy. I would note that while limited pay product is a headwind to premium growth, it has no impact on profitability as we release deferred profit liability into earnings.\r\nNet investment income primarily in Japan is expected to decline by roughly 1% to 2% in 2016, as a result of calls and maturities of private placement holdings. New money will be reinvested according to our strategic asset allocation, though at lower rates due to lower market yields but arguably will reinforce our strategy of having a more diverse and higher-quality portfolio as we remain cautious on the go-forward credit environment.\r\nWe expect core benefit ratios to remain stable and consistent with our generally favorable experience thus far in 2015, and relative to our forecasted long-term ranges discussed at our May financial analyst briefing. In Japan, we anticipate continued strong claims trends in our cancer block in particular. In the U.S., expense ratios are up modestly as a result of investment in overall IT group administration and everwell platforms.\r\nTurning to Slide 18. We expect overall capital conditions to remain stable but are keeping an eye on credit conditions. We are seeing the early signs of a credit cycle with spreads widening in recent months and downgrades modestly outpacing upgrades. We expect to maintain our SMR and RBC ratios in the mid- to high 800% range subject to market values changes. Our SMR ratio is sensitive to rates and spreads, with a roughly 220 point volatility provision that recognizes the unrealized gains in our AFS portfolio and the potential for stress conditions. Leverage will remain in the 23% to 25% range, and we expect to pre-fund approximately $1 billion of maturities prior to coming due later in the year and early in 2017.\r\nWe have revised our plans for repatriation in 2015 and now expect to repatriate an additional JPY 60 billion this month, which represents the remaining capital released from our 2015 reinsurance transaction. The December repatriation and associated statutory dividends for the holding company support our $1.4 billion of targeted repurchase for 2016, front-end loading roughly $1 billion of our repurchase in the first half of the year. Note that our 2016 repatriation estimate does not currently assume any reinsurance and represents a stable repatriation of after-tax FSA earnings.\r\nWe have reviewed in detail our 2016 and 3-year excess capital position and remain comfortable with a deployable capital range of $6.3 billion to $7.5 billion through 2017. The lower end of the range consistent with our organic free cash flow and the range itself representing additional deployable capital, we believe, is embedded in our Japan and U.S. businesses.\r\nFinally, I'll close with my comments on specific EPS outlook and a few thoughts on driving long-term valuation. We expect stable growth in EPS in the 3% to 7% range, excluding the impact of currency movement. As a basis for our growth rate estimate, for 2015, we assume the midpoint of our $1.36 to $1.56 EPS range for the fourth quarter and normalized for a net $0.05 of positive items called out in our earnings releases during the year. We provide specific EPS guidance and sensitivities to the yen, which remains largely consistent with our third quarter disclosures. We estimate that every JPY 1 move on the annual average exchange rate will equal an approximately $0.025 per share impact on next year's earnings.\r\nROE is expected to remain in the 18% to 21% range, excluding the impact of currency. Our cost of capital is among the lowest in the industry, benefiting from low exposure to more volatile and capital-intensive equity market and interest-rate-sensitive retirement businesses, transparent profit margins and generating yen cash flows, which allows us to borrow in yen at very low rates. In addition, we believe our work in recent years to reduce concentrated and potentially volatile exposures in the general account have also contributed.\r\nOur financial playbook for creating value is straightforward: defend attractive margins in our core supplemental health businesses; in Japan, allocate capital away from more volatile return and capital-intensive businesses to stable businesses that earn comfortably above our cost of capital; invest to improve service and efficiency in our fast-growing U.S. brokerage and group business; manage the risk in our investment portfolio and associated SMR volatility; and finally, identify idle or excess capital for future deployment at higher rates of excess return while returning back to shareholders.\r\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Dan for some closing comments.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Fred. I will close with some thoughts that should be top of mind as we look to next year. Everything that you've heard today is designed around growing our franchise, protecting policyholders and ultimately driving shareholder value.\r\nIn Japan and the United States we dominate our markets, and we plan to keep it that way. Aflac Japan, the leading provider of third sector products, will be focused on new product innovation in the third sector market. While we expect sales of first sector products to decline in 2016, those first sector products we do sell will encourage the cross-selling of third sector products. Aflac U.S. is concentrating on leveraging our brand to fuel our growth and benefit our distribution channels while investing to enhance customer experience and efficiencies.\r\nTo follow up on Fred's comments, our goal is to achieve stable EPS growth while also investing in the business to drive future growth. When it comes to dividend increases, we belong to an elite club. This year marked the 33rd year of increasing our cash dividend. In addition, by the end of 2015, we expect to have repurchased $1.3 billion of common stock and planned for a modest increase in 2016, absent more compelling opportunities.\r\nI want to reiterate what we said at the financial analyst briefing in May: we still believe there's an opportunity to deploy approximately $6.3 billion to $7.5 billion of capital when looking at a 3-year period ending 2017. We will continue to evaluate all options when it comes to deploying capital and growing the business, but as in the past, we remain disciplined. You've already heard me say that my job is to balance the interest of all stakeholders. I think we did a good job of that this year just as we did in the past, and I believe we're going to do it again next year by delivering on our promises to our policyholders and ultimately enhancing shareholder value.\r\nNow I'll turn the program back over to Robin. Robin?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Dan. Now we're ready to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] All right, we're ready to go. We'll take the first question, please.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Robin Wilkey (Executives)】\nGood morning, and welcome to our 2016 outlook call. Joining me this morning from the U.S. is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President of Aflac Incorporated; Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated; Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S.; and Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Investment Officer. Also from Tokyo joining us today is Paul Amos, President of Aflac; Hiroshi Yamauchi, President and COO of Aflac Japan.\r\nBefore we start, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they're prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at these quarterly earnings releases from some of our -- for some of the various risk factors that can materially impact our results.\r\nNow I'll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some high-level comments and outlines of the company's strategic vision; then Paul will provide the strategic focus for our Japan operations and outlook; Teresa will give an update on the U.S. strategy and focus; and Fred will follow up with comments about our capital management strategy and financial outlook; and then Dan will follow up at the end. Dan?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Daniel Amos (Executives)】\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. Many of you probably heard me speak about the importance of the promises that we make to our policyholders and being there when they need us most. Today, we're going to share with you our outlook for 2016. But before we do that, I'd like to share Aflac's strategic vision: to offer higher-quality voluntary products, solutions and services through diverse distribution outlets. In doing so, we are ultimately building upon our market-leading position to drive long-term shareholder value.\r\nAt Aflac, we've always managed our business for the long term while maintaining a sharp focus on the financial objectives. At the same time, we continue to work on enhancing our customer service and building our book of business. In doing so, we successfully established strategic points of leverage in both Japan and the United States that we will use to grow and drive shareholder value.\r\nOur industry-leading market share and scale in both Japan and the United States drive our administrative efficiencies. This allows us to offer affordable and value coverage to our customers and competitive compensation to our distributors. At the same time, it drives value for our shareholders. Leveraging our leading position in both countries will help position us for growth going forward.\r\nAs product innovators, we've experienced a tremendous amount of success in leveraging the strength of Aflac's recognition and powerful brand to drive sales. About 9 out of 10 people in both countries recognize the Aflac brand. Our brand is a combination of many elements, with the most visible being the Aflac Duck. But it's also made up of trust that we build through relationships with businesses, the policyholders and consumers. In Japan and the U.S., Aflac's established brand has served as an effective door opener. In turn, this serves as a catalyst for customers to be more receptive to hearing how Aflac's products can help them. As just one example, in the United States, One Day Pay, our industry-leading claims initiative, allows us to process, approve and pay eligible claims in just 1 day. Our policyholders and consumers continue to tell us how our commitment to paying claims fast through One Day Pay underscores Aflac's integrity and commitment to delivering on our promise.\r\nHaving diverse and productive distribution channels is a strategic point of leverage and a vital component of our growth strategy in Japan and in the United States. As such, this is one area that we focus a great deal of our efforts. Our goal is to have a presence in all outlets where consumers in both countries want to make their insurance purchasing [ph] decisions. We offer innovative products and high-quality customized service to provide businesses and their employees with solutions that protect financial well-being.\r\nWe've established a strong capital position with stable earnings and cash flow. Our capital ratios demonstrate our commitment to maintain strong capital levels and flexibility on behalf of our policyholders, bondholders and shareholders. We also regularly assess our capital adequacy to ensure we maintain strong, even under economic scenarios.\r\nNow let me turn the program over to Paul, who will talk about Aflac Japan. Paul?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Paul Amos (Executives)】\nThank you, Dan. Japan faces the unprecedented challenges of keeping its economy running against the backdrop of social change and reform. As you are aware, the Japanese economy has recently dipped into a technical recession. At the same time, Japan's government is under increasing financial strain to support a growing number of retirees. Given Japan's aging population, declining birth rate and rising medical treatment cost, their health care system has been under increasing financial pressure. These factors present an opportunity. As health-related expenditures continue to grow, so does the need for insurance across all ages, especially the type of products we offer, insurance for daily living. We believe Aflac's products are more vital than ever before, and we are committed to being there for our policyholders in their time of need.\r\nAnother factor of social change in Japan relates to womenomics or the increased participation of women in the workforce. Womenomics represents the primary way the government is attempting to address challenges of a shrinking workforce. At Aflac Japan, diversity management is an integrable part of our overall management strategy. For example, last year, we implemented a comprehensive leadership initiative called the women's empowerment program, and we are working to raise the percentage of leadership positions held by women. Research from various sources, including McKinsey consulting, has proven that diverse organizations deliver better financial results, which will impact both Japan's economy and continue to help Aflac Japan.\r\nTurning to the third sector market. With many insurance companies seeing growth opportunities, the landscape remains competitive. While the number of competitors has decreased, medical product competitiveness is on the rise with an increasing variety of products that have shorter life cycles. At the same time, the ongoing low interest rate environment has created changes in the first sector marketplace. Amid this evolving market environment, Aflac is determined to maintain and further expand its position as the leading insurance company in Japan's third sector market by providing solutions for our policyholders as they face a heavy financial burden related to health care cost. In 2015, Aflac Japan significantly expanded its third sector product sales and distribution. Notably, we've strengthened our relationship with Japan Post Holdings.\r\nWith respect to third sector products, you will recall at the end of 2014, Aflac Japan introduced the latest version through our cancer product line, New Cancer DAYS, and its strong momentum continued into 2015 across all distribution channels. Then in June 2015, we enhanced our EVER medical insurance with the introduction of riders related to critical illnesses. As we have experienced in the past, the launch of these 2 significant products served to boost sales in 2015. We anticipate that in 2016, the new product schedule will focus on product refinements, including the potential to enter a new area of the third sector market.\r\nIn terms of first sector products, the market is further segmented as the level-premium protection oriented products are largely sold in traditional channels and lump sum savings-oriented products are popular in the bank channel. We are refining our approach and will concentrate on level-premium products for cross-selling and stability of returns. The goal is to split the sector into those products that we want to sell based on their characteristics, profitability and limited capital strain. The low interest rate environment has impacted our view on selling first sector products. And the action we took in 2012 in terms of limiting the sale of WAYS, for instance, was the right path for us to take. Going forward, we believe the sale of level-premium products not only enhances the sale of third sector products through cross-selling, but importantly, the product profitability of a level-premium product is more stable, with returns that exceed our cost of capital and benefit from the cross-sell of higher-return third sector products.\r\nGiven the very strong sales growth in the first 9 months and our expectation for the remainder of the year, we now anticipate that 2015 sales growth for third sector products will be at the high end of the 10% to 13% range. The successful launch of 2 products in the cancer and health lines creates difficult 2015 sales comparison. As such, we anticipate third sector sales in 2016 will be down mid-single digit. While these results from 2015 create a tough comparison, we are looking to drive a compound annual growth rate for third sector product in the range of 4% to 6% over the long term. We believe that a continued revision and expansion of our third sector product line will aid in achieving this objective.\r\nWith respect to first sector sales, 2016 will be a year of transition, making specific guidance more challenging. We expect our proactive approach will drive lump sum product sales down considerably, while level-premium product will essentially track third sector sales down modestly during the year. Recognizing we have an Aflac policy in 1 out of 4 households in Japan, we pay careful attention to the social change and have a track record of developing products and solutions to meet the evolving need of our customers.\r\nThank you, and now let me turn it over to Teresa White, who will be covering Aflac U.S.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Teresa White (Executives)】\nThank you, Paul. I'd like to begin by sharing some highlights of what we're observing in the U.S. market, much of which has been impacted by the Affordable Care Act, or ACA. We continue to see employers opt for high-deductible health plans to reduce expenses associated with offering employee benefit. Although small employers, meaning those fewer than 50 employees, are not required to offer major medical, they continue to look for ways to assist their employees with health coverage. In addition, mid to large employers are still overwhelmed by the regulatory aspects of ACA. These employers are seeking ways to make coverage affordable while, at the same time, reduce the administrative burden of the regulations. Nevertheless, workers continue to look to employers for health care solutions, especially since 52% of U.S. workers can't even afford $1,000 in out-of-pocket expenses. This dynamic has caused many brokers to look to voluntary to help their clients fill gaps brought by a high-deductible health plan.\r\nFrom a competitive standpoint, the U.S. market remains very dynamic and has been subject to continual change. Group players are entering the voluntary market by either shifting some of their employer-paid offerings to voluntary or creating voluntary products of their own. The ACA has introduced new rules and greater complexity, especially in HR processes, which have led to an increased administrative burden to the employer. In response, this has prompted a renewed focus on technology to help with decision support, HR benefits enrollment, and to help employees to navigate the complex health care system. This environment creates additional opportunities for Aflac, which leads me to our strategic playbook for 2016.\r\nNow as a backdrop, our goal in 2015 was to build out our 2-channel distribution model more specifically by clarifying roles within each channel. Historically, these channels have competed, which created channel conflict. To manage this, we've leveraged the strength of each channel. We've been focusing our career agents on the smaller employers since they typically enjoy the most success by serving employers with less than 50 employees. Here, we're using everwell to drive growth, and I'll talk a little bit more about this in a few minutes. For the mid- to large-case market, we're attracting more brokers than ever before. In fact, the strong performance in many of our successful market operations is due in part to increased collaboration between brokers and career agents. We've made great strides and now have one of the more dynamic value-add distribution models in the industry, which gives us the potential to be unstoppable.\r\nLooking to 2016, we'll continue to focus on enhancing the productivity of our sales distribution.

Therefore, we'll continue to focus on recruiting career agents, training them and promoting the use of everwell to support growth in this segment.

Despite these new entrants, we believe One Day Pay, our industry-leading claim initiative, stands out to consumers because it gets cash in the hands of those consumers when they need it the most. We'll continue to promote One Day Pay to the consumer as we feel that this will help drive increased brand loyalty and account penetration.\r\nLastly, as the voluntary market continues to grow, with the broker channel group products growing at a faster rate, scale and efficiency will become increasingly important. Although we have made some investments in our platform to support our broker partners, we need to make additional technology investments to support continued growth while enhancing persistency and efficiency of the business.\r\nLooking ahead, keep in mind that as our production through brokers grow, we anticipate sales will be increasingly concentrated in the fourth quarter, more specifically the last 4 weeks of the year. In addition, this is the first full year in which the broker sales forecasting model has been in play. We continue to believe that we're on track to meet the lower end of the 3% to 7% range in the U.S. in 2015, and we're assuming that all of the enrollments that are expected will proceed as planned at the end of the year. Now as we look to 2016, we believe sales will increase in the range of 3% to 7%. The voluntary work-site market is currently projected to grow at 5% over the next 3 years. And as you know, we won't be satisfied until we're growing at or above industry rate.\r\nThank you. And now let me turn the call over to Fred.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Frederick Crawford (Executives)】\nThank you, Teresa.

In addition, by the end of 2015, we expect to have repurchased $1.3 billion of common stock and planned for a modest increase in 2016, absent more compelling opportunities.\r\nI want to reiterate what we said at the financial analyst briefing in May: we still believe there's an opportunity to deploy approximately $6.3 billion to $7.5 billion of capital when looking at a 3-year period ending 2017. We will continue to evaluate all options when it comes to deploying capital and growing the business, but as in the past, we remain disciplined. You've already heard me say that my job is to balance the interest of all stakeholders. I think we did a good job of that this year just as we did in the past, and I believe we're going to do it again next year by delivering on our promises to our policyholders and ultimately enhancing shareholder value.\r\nNow I'll turn the program back over to Robin. Robin?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Robin Wilkey (Executives)】\nThank you, Dan. Now we're ready to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] All right, we're ready to go. We'll take the first question, please.",
      "transcript_text3": "On Japan sales and, I thought, your guidance of sales, I think you mentioned down in the mid-single digits. It seems just slightly more conservative than what I would have assumed. And a big part of your growth in 2015 has been through the Japan Post, where you continue to add new branches. I would have thought that, that would provided -- that would have provided a tailwind to sales. So maybe, Paul, you could be -- give us a few more details on what's behind your expectation of the mid-single-digit decline.\n\n---\n\nSure, Jimmy. I'd be glad to do that. First and foremost, if you look at 2016 in comparison to 2014, we're moving along exactly where we originally expected. The reality is that 2015 came in significantly higher than we expected. As you'll recall, I think we originally had a range of between 1% and 5% for this year. And we moved that up on several different occasions, and we now expect it at the top end of that 2 -- 10% to 13% range. And so 2015 has been a year where we feel we've outperformed our expectations. We do expect to grow long term at a 4% to 6% CAGR, and we expect that to be onward and moving upward. At the same time, we also acknowledge that our product cycles have an effect and impact on our annual sales. We've had back-to-back years where we've launched our new cancer plan as well as some revisions and new riders to our medical plan. This coming year, we expect there to be some product revisions, but we do expect that we could potentially enter a new segment of the third sector market anytime you go into a brand-new product that can create a circumstance where you have to create that market and it can take a period of time to do so. So we feel that we're setting ourselves up for the long term. It does mean the potential for sales being down slightly, but we still feel that we're making the right decisions for growing our sales long term in the compound annual growth rate that we previously mentioned.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then if I could ask just one more. Fred, you mentioned that your guidance doesn't assume anything in terms of reinsurance deals, but what are you looking at in terms of whether you decide to do additional reinsurance deals in 2016? And if you do, do them, what do you view as the most likely use of the capital?\n\n---\n\nYes. Thanks, Jimmy. I think a couple of things about releasing additional excess capital, particularly in Japan, where we've done it before. As you know, what we're doing there essentially is, through reinsurance, we're unlocking the difference in regulatory reserves relative to Japan and U.S. and freeing up that capital. And in some cases, we retain that capital to support our SMR ratios. That's being done on a block-by-block basis, as you know. So it requires assessing each block. And as you move forward and look at additional blocks, the level of complexity increases. And depending on the block of business, you may even see pricing differences, i.e. reinsurance getting more pricey. The reason I point out that complexity in some of the pricing is that it really goes to the main motivation, which is if we're going to go in and unlock additional capital, we want to make sure that we can generate very attractive returns on the deployment of that capital. And so I view that exercise of unlocking excess capital over and above our free cash flow as somewhat opportunistic. We want to see good, attractive excess returns. Now that may be in the form of buying back our stock, but it may be other opportunities. And we want that optionality to look at it. The key is it's available. It's available for the defensive measures. It's available to reinvest back in our model. It's available to take advantage of opportunities, but the key is driving excess capital with that release.\n\n---\n\nI was hoping a follow-up on the new third sector product commentary. Is there any help you can give us on understanding what that might look like?\n\n---\n\nUnfortunately, Randy, we can't comment on that at this time. All I can tell you is that we continue to look at third sector products because of their product characteristics, the strong profitability, and we will be looking to enter a potential product there. But we have to work with our regulators as well as finalizing that product, and we'll look to hopefully launch that sometime in 2016.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then sticking with sales on the U.S. side, the range of 3% to 7% is pretty wide. But what would have to happen, I guess, for you to hit the high end, the 7%? Can you walk us through what all needs to go right for that to happen in 2016?\n\n---\n\n2016 range, I believe I meant to say 3% to 5% -- I never [ph] said 3% to 7%, but the slide deck has the appropriate number. But it's 3% to 5%. And the changes that we've made with the distribution and the growth that we're seeing from a broker perspective, we believe, as we continue to mature, our market offices continue to mature, that we will be on track with meeting the high end of that range.\n\n---\n\nLet me make a comment about U.S. sales. I don't think our biggest challenge is external. I believe it's been internal. One thing I think Teresa has done a stellar job of is we are -- we've got 2 now separate distribution channels. You go back 4 or 5 years ago, we really only had one, and that was our field force, which is very important to us. And it's still the foundation on which everything has been built. But as we're writing the bigger accounts with the brokers, in the past, there has been real conflict. And what we've tried to do is to bring them together as one and use our field force in certain cases to help with the enrollment. And it's working out quite well. The easiest thing we could have done was to have had 2 separate companies, kept them totally apart. The problem was everybody wanted the Aflac brand. So we couldn't separate them. Everyone wanted it. So we brought them together, which has created internal conflict over the last couple of years. It is much, much better. And I give Teresa and Andy and everyone else credit for helping that come together. But it is still -- it's been years of competitiveness, let's call it. And it doesn't just go away overnight. You have to work through it, as you all know. And so that's one of the challenges. So as we continue to make and show examples of people working together and writing big accounts, it's going to only open the door. And then as we are driving our new associates and others to writing the 100 or less, which we've been working on for a couple of years, and as we work on getting the big accounts to be written with the large brokers through the group platform, that continues to work well. The area that's still the conflict is the 100 to about the 1,000 accounts, and those are the ones that we deal with. So as we work through that, I think the opportunity for future growth is tremendous. And again, I give Teresa credit for fighting that battle because it isn't an easy one because they've been in a competitive environment since inception of the company. So I do think it's coming together. Watch out when it does because that's when you'll see the growth.\n\n---\n\nAnd one more on U.S. sales. And sorry if I missed it, but I mean, how significant is the everwell piece of that? I mean, because most of what -- most of what you're talking about is kind of the traditional sales organization and the changes that have been made there over the last year. But is -- with everwell, I believe you're going to hit the high end of the 2017 sales guidance as -- maybe if that was higher, does that become more material then?\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely. everwell becomes very material. One of the things that we're seeing with our adoption of everwell, especially during the pilot, we see a 40% increase in penetration when people utilize everwell. So it positions us quite nicely with the Affordable Care Act, where we have major medical and the high-deductible health plans being presented alongside voluntary. So it gives the small-case market something that they've not had, which is an opportunity to shop for their coverage on one exchange that allows them to see voluntary and major medical.\n\n---\n\nI was -- I want to turn back to Slide 17 if we could, the key assumptions on earnings drivers. I'm trying to understand the comment that Aflac expects current benefit ratios in the U.S. and Japan to benefit from favorable claims trends. But at the same time, it looks like the benefit ratio, 2016 relative to 2015, this can be largely unchanged.\n\n---\n\nYes. And that's in -- what we're saying there is if you go back to FAB, the FAB Meeting, this year, I'd call your attention to some of the long ranges -- or long-term ranges that we put in for benefit ratios both in the U.S. and Japan. And what you will notice is that, year-to-date in 2015, we've been tracking in a fairly material way at a favorable -- the favorable end of those ranges. And really, what we're saying in our 2016 projections is that relative to our year-to-date performance, we would expect to move forward with continued favorability. Now it moves a little bit from what we're seeing year-to-date, but realize how much more favorable it is relative to our FAB guidance. So for example, our guidance on U.S. benefit ratios at FAB was 50% to 52%. We've been, year-to-date, tracking very low at roughly 48%, and we're suggesting 47% to 49% as the range. So that's really what I mean by that comment. It's the continuation of what we believe to be really favorable or net favorable performance in 2015.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Thanks for clarifying that. And then on the Japan Post opportunity, I guess following up on an earlier question, I would have thought that, that would have continued momentum into 2016. Am I thinking about that the wrong way?\n\n---\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot comment on Japan Post. I can tell you that we continue to be very happy with the relationship. We continue to succeed in not only the implementation of the 20,000 post offices but the use of the additional product and -- as well as the Aflac core product and the sale of that channel, along with selling to combo [ph] insurance. And all 3 of those continue to meet or exceed our expectations, and we're happy with what's happening there. At the same time, we can't give any comments on specifics or numbers related to our Japan Post relationship.\n\n---\n\nIn Japan, the next year, you've indicated that you plan to focus, at least on the life insurance side if I understand your comments correctly, on level-premium as opposed to the single premium. To me, this sounds like primitive life insurance and that you'll be going head-to-head against companies whose brand's in this area than with largest career-agent-oriented companies in the country, whose brands are as strong as yours are in that corner of the market. So my one question is twofold. One, what is Aflac's history in successfully selling level-premium FIRST sector products? To what extent have you done them? And to what extent have you been successful? And why should we think that, given the different competitive nature and the relative less strength of your brand in the first sector market and the third sector, that you can be successful?\n\n---\n\nThis is Paul, Eric. Let me say that our exclusive agencies have always been offered a well-rounded product portfolio that was, of course, driven first and foremost by third sector products beginning with cancer and now medical but also with first sector products, both lump sum and level-premium. And as I have said on several calls, we have made a commitment to continue to offer those to our exclusive agencies, all forms of those products, because we believe that is what's necessary for them to be competitive in the marketplace and part of their commitment to us by providing us the exclusivity of only offering Aflac products. What we are saying, however, is that in the highly competitive bank channel and other markets, when it comes to lump sum premium products, we believe we want to significantly deemphasize those products. We're taking measures in order to continue the decline in the sale of those products, but we have seen such a high cross-sell ratio between our level-premium first sector as well to our third sector products by our associates and other traditional channels that we believe that selling those products is not only an enhancement because it exceeds our cost of capital, but it's also an enhancement because it drives the additional premium at the higher profit margin that we're achieving through the third sector sale.\n\n---\n\nIf I could just get one in quickly actually for Teresa, and it is that I have always looked at your tally, your regularly reported tally of producing agents because I've just viewed that, historically, as an important indicator of the future of sales. Those numbers have not been going in the right direction. They've been declining in the United States for some time. As we look forward into 2016 -- whether you, Teresa or Dan or whoever feels appropriate to answer this question, will then -- will the count of producing agents be as important in terms of understanding Aflac in the future as it was in the past? And what should we expect for this, this census, this count of producing agents?\n\n---\n\nEric, this is Teresa. One of the things that I've discussed in the past is how the bifurcation of the model, creating the career agent distribution and then separating it from the broker distribution, will, I think, help you in doing exactly what you're attempting to do. One of the things that we've done this year is we started to separate those, and yes, we will continue to drive career recruiting. Today, that number is a holistic number that represents career recruiting and brokers. And what we wanted to do is we wanted to separate those numbers. And I believe in 2016, that's the plan -- and Robin is shaking her head yes, that's our plan for the briefing go forward. We have this year where we basically had to settle in and get everybody in the right bucket. But from there, go forward, the plan is to continue career recruiting. And then you heard me express, from a broker perspective, deepening the relationship with our current, existing brokers. We will continue to grow our broker relationships, but quite frankly, what I wanted to concentrate on in 2015 and in 2016 is deepening the relationship that we have with our current broker partners. We have a number of broker partners out there that we're not selling a lot of Aflac insurance. And I think there is tremendous opportunity there, and so that's the plan.\n\n---\n\nI'd like to follow up on the discussion around margins. Could you clarify exactly what the dynamics are that are going to lead to, again, beneficial experience in 2016? And then maybe more specifically, what it is you're expecting that changes in actually 2017 and beyond that causes that to come back down to the margin ranges that you gave earlier this year at FAB?\n\n---\n\nSure. Seth, it's Fred. A couple of things. So in Japan, what we're seeing is really predominantly a continuation of the favorable experience we've been enjoying really in the cancer block of business. And as that continues, we would expect that to generate the lower end of the benefit ratio. And if you recall back to our third quarter discussion, you have a couple of dynamics going on there. Not only do you have favorable claims dynamics due to hospitalization rates and other issues that are trending in Japan, but you also have to constantly review and look at your reserving dynamics as well, IBNR and the like. And so it's not uncommon for us to see quarter-to-quarter benefits from both the trends and the review of the reserves, particularly year-to-year. So that's really what's driving Japan. Otherwise, we see relative stability across the other lines of business in terms of benefit ratio, including first sector, which, as you know, carries naturally higher benefit ratio and lower expense ratio. In the U.S., it's really a general continuation of good performance, nothing unusual spiking out in 2016, just an overall continuation as we track that business. I think that the bigger mover to pay attention to in the U.S. as it relates to margins is actually the expense ratio. As I noted in my comments, it remains a little elevated, about 100 basis points or so elevated, and that's actually predominantly due to what Teresa commented on in terms of our proactive need to invest in both IT, automation and end-to-end administration around our fast-growing, broker-driven group product sales. And so that is really a proactive decision on our part, which adds about 80 basis points to our expense ratio but obviously has very tight return on investment characteristics with it as we roll forward. What I would comment on in terms of 2017 and '18 is we'll obviously refresh all of our margin views at this year's FAB and roll forward a 3-year look. And so yes, at the moment, we're sticking with the current ranges that were discussed earlier in the year, but obviously, as we grow quarter-to-quarter and year-by-year, we'll continue to review those trends and whether or not we expect them to stay around longer or deteriorate or improve.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So is it fair to categorize those longer-term trends that there's some conservatism built in, a provision for that?\n\n---\n\nSure. I mean, when we use the term favorable, what we're suggesting to you is that indeed, they're running favorable to what we otherwise would have expected over a long run. And that is true. And we've been enjoying that in 2015. You've seen that in our results. And so as we sit here today, we think we are traveling on the favorable end of benefit ratios both in Japan and in the U.S. And that should be noted. But we're going to continue to monitor that for what we think is more sustainable going forward or whether or not we would see some natural leakage. Keep in mind that when I think about these benefit ratios, these are still supporting extremely strong return on equity and return on overall IRRs on all of our voluntary supplemental health businesses.\n\n---\n\nFred, the -- I wanted to discuss Japan revenues. I know you mentioned NII is expected to be down a bit, and you mentioned what you expect on overall margins in Japan. How about premium revenue growth in '16 versus '15?\n\n---\n\nSure, a couple of things and then I will, maybe, add a little more color on the NII in the process, too. But in terms of Japan revenue, a couple of things to be mindful of. I think it's natural for you to come to the table, saying -- coming up with particularly a year of very strong sales in the third sector that we would see a little more robust growth in Japan revenue. But we've got a couple of things going on. One is mass, meaning with the very, very large in-force size of our business that's generating in and around JPY 1.5 trillion a year of earned premium, when you have even the very strong persistency we enjoy or roughly, say, 5% lapse rates, you've got to have one whole heck of a growth engine, if you will, to just keep pace with the natural lapsation. For example, if you look at third sector, we would expect to see something in the way of 5% natural runoff or lapsation, and that's on a JPY 1.1 trillion earned premium book. And so that suggests to you that your third sector sales engine alone needs to be doing much better than JPY 55 billion or JPY 60 billion of sales just to keep some growth rate going. Now as you look more expansive -- and the good news is that Paul and his team have generated a very good engine. I mean, if you look at that chart, if you go back a couple of years, the distribution platform was generating in and around JPY 60 billion to JPY 65 billion a year of new sales. That engine now, even as we look forward to 2016, is now approaching a $75 billion to as high as $80 billion (sic) [ JPY 75 billion to as high as JPY 80 billion ] distribution engine, and that's going to serve to help grow third sector premium. Earned premium in and around the 1.5% to 2% range would be my estimate. When you look at first sector, however, you've got a couple of things going on. One, naturally, you're going to see premium come down because as Paul has outlined, we're refining our approach to it, moving away from lump sum. But the other thing you have going on is you also have some of the more limited pay product. If you recall back to this year's FAB Meeting, we have limited pay product. When it reaches paid-up status, you'll see a more drop-off in the premium levels. And in fact, moving from 2015 to '16, we're seeing about JPY 30 billion of drop-off just related to the paid-up status of this limited premium pay product. Now again, remember, that doesn't impact profitability because we have a liability that we release into earnings, which keeps profitability constant, but it does pressure premium. So when you think of the combination of reinsurance, which is now tailing off, we had reinsurance effect this year compared to next year probably around JPY 5 billion or so of depressed growth related to reinsurance. If you look at that plus the first sector, plus the limited pay product now starting to reach paid-up status, all of those things are contributing to a muted premium growth rate in Japan.\n\n---\n\nAnd Fred, if you just -- following you on that math with the JPY 30 billion drop-off, are we getting like a point or 2 of a decline in premium revenue? Was that directionally close?\n\n---\n\nYes. If you just isolate first sector business, which runs about JPY 0.5 billion a year in earned premium, that -- just that paid-up status is contributing to roughly a 1% decline year-over-year in the earned premium. That's for '16.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And you said third sector is supposed to grown 1.5% to 2%. So is it fair to say that you'd still get -- you get kind of flattish to maybe modest growth overall then?\n\n---\n\nWell, as I said in my comments, we're expecting about 1% growth in premium overall.\n\n---\n\n1% growth, got it, okay. That's helpful color. I appreciate it. And then just my follow-up is, on the -- in terms of the product shift, moving away from lump sum sales in first sector, can you all remind us what percent of Japanese sales this year in first sector were lump sum versus level pay?\n\n---\n\nI don't have that handy. I don't know if any -- if -- Paul, if you happen to have that handy or not?\n\n---\n\nWe're looking for it right here, just 1 second.\n\n---\n\nI'm thinking roughly 1/3.\n\n---\n\n1/3 would have been lump sum? Or 1/3 would have been level pay?\n\n---\n\n1/3 lump sum.\n\n---\n\n1/3 lump sum, got it.\n\n---\n\nAnd if we need to correct that, Tom, we'll do that. We'll look at it and verify that.\n\n---\n\nOkay.\n\n---\n\nReally quickly, just looking in our projections, just to verify, it's about half and half. It's split almost down the middle on premium, on an AP basis.\n\n---\n\nAnd -- Paul, and that roughly half of the first sector sales, is that going to go to 0? Is that -- or is that just a substantial decline but you'll still have some level of lump sum sales?\n\n---\n\nWe are going to have some for a couple of different reasons, Tom. First of all, as I mentioned earlier, when Eric asked, we're going to continue to allow our exclusive agencies to offer that lump sum product because they have to have it in order to be competitive, but we are going to significantly change certain rate in order to make that happen. At the same time, we also have commitments to the bank channel, and those commitments tend to last 6 months at a time. And so we'll continue to see that happen through the first quarter of next year because as you know, the Japan fiscal calendar begins April 1. And so we'll probably see a slower tapering in the first quarter with a faster tapering beyond the first quarter.\n\n---\n\nA question on Japan sales and the long-term target of 4% to 6% for the third sector. It just seems like in recent years, we've been experiencing really strong growth in a particular year when you've had a new product introduction and then when you faced comps that were difficult in the subsequent year, had less robust sales growth. So I guess my question is, as we think about this 4% to 6% long-term guidance and the shortening product cycle that the industry is experiencing, Paul, do you think that we can get to a point where you're generating 4% to 6% third sector sales growth on a consistent basis?\n\n---\n\nThat would certainly be the ideal situation. That said, certain products are going to have a higher level of attractiveness than others. The reaction to our cancer plan exceeded all of our expectations, and we certainly want to take that premium and offer those products that exceeded our total sales number. What I would tell you is that one of the reasons we'd like to enter an additional product line in the third sector is we'd like to see our vision on an annual basis on a 3-year cycle. And so if we add 3 core products in third sector with 1 product revision every year, that would put a -- hopefully, a smoother number for us in attempting to achieve that CAGR. That said, it's very difficult to predict market receptiveness, but that is the objective. As I said, part of the reason this year that we not only face difficult comps but in trying to launch a brand new product in an industry and in -- with a sales distribution that tends to be slower to adapt new products as opposed to new product revisions, we're just trying to be mindful of that as we head into 2016 and think that we can prepare ourselves better for the longer term in achieving that CAGR.\n\n---\n\nI want to say something. Suneet, this is Dan. In the old days, I would have had a contest that started in the first quarter to shift some of the business from the fourth quarter to the first quarter to try to level it out. It was a conference call that we had with all of you, where everyone said, \"Get the business when you can, as quick as you can.\" And so we shifted back to getting the business as fast and as quick as we can. And we felt like it's better to have the 13% now than if we'd ended up with 6% and 5%, so -- or whatever those totals might be to sum up. But ultimately, we were just trying to get it in. So we could have made it more level by shifting the context, not literally holding business, but just shifting things. So it is our outstanding production in the fourth quarter that's causing our problem for 2016. And so I just want to be clear on that.\n\n---\n\nIt's appreciated. One quick follow-up on Japan. I know you can't give us any specifics about Japan Post, and I appreciate that. But if I go back, Dan, to the relationship that you had with Dai-ichi years ago when you first started it, my recollection is that sales growth was quite strong in that first year and then the relationship became somewhat of a drag on growth in subsequent years because even though you were generating new business, it wasn't quite at the level of that extremely strong first year. So I guess my question is directionally, should we think that Japan Post will be any different from that situation that you experienced?\n\n---\n\nAnd the reason you should is with Dai-ichi Life, we hit it all at once. It's been rolled out and -- Japan Post has been rolled out by over a period of years, not just one quick shot. Will it eventually slow down? Probably so unless we come up with something else, new, innovative that we can get together with them on. But let me just say that I give our relationship with Japan Post from what I thought it would be to where it is today, an A. And that's all I can say about that. But I think Aflac Japan and the leadership that Paul and Yamauchi, the sales force, all the people, get an A on what's been going on. And our relationship is stronger today with Japan Post than it has ever been, and I look for it continuing to be strong because it's helping not only us, but it's helping Japan Post and it's helping the policyholders in Japan.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much for joining us this morning.

      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Jamminder Bhullar (Analysts)】\nOn Japan sales and, I thought, your guidance of sales, I think you mentioned down in the mid-single digits. It seems just slightly more conservative than what I would have assumed. And a big part of your growth in 2015 has been through the Japan Post, where you continue to add new branches. I would have thought that, that would provided -- that would have provided a tailwind to sales. So maybe, Paul, you could be -- give us a few more details on what's behind your expectation of the mid-single-digit decline.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Amos (Executives)】\nSure, Jimmy. I'd be glad to do that. First and foremost, if you look at 2016 in comparison to 2014, we're moving along exactly where we originally expected. The reality is that 2015 came in significantly higher than we expected. As you'll recall, I think we originally had a range of between 1% and 5% for this year. And we moved that up on several different occasions, and we now expect it at the top end of that 2 -- 10% to 13% range. And so 2015 has been a year where we feel we've outperformed our expectations. We do expect to grow long term at a 4% to 6% CAGR, and we expect that to be onward and moving upward. At the same time, we also acknowledge that our product cycles have an effect and impact on our annual sales. We've had back-to-back years where we've launched our new cancer plan as well as some revisions and new riders to our medical plan. This coming year, we expect there to be some product revisions, but we do expect that we could potentially enter a new segment of the third sector market anytime you go into a brand-new product that can create a circumstance where you have to create that market and it can take a period of time to do so. So we feel that we're setting ourselves up for the long term. It does mean the potential for sales being down slightly, but we still feel that we're making the right decisions for growing our sales long term in the compound annual growth rate that we previously mentioned.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jamminder Bhullar (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then if I could ask just one more. Fred, you mentioned that your guidance doesn't assume anything in terms of reinsurance deals, but what are you looking at in terms of whether you decide to do additional reinsurance deals in 2016? And if you do, do them, what do you view as the most likely use of the capital?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frederick Crawford (Executives)】\nYes. Thanks, Jimmy. I think a couple of things about releasing additional excess capital, particularly in Japan, where we've done it before. As you know, what we're doing there essentially is, through reinsurance, we're unlocking the difference in regulatory reserves relative to Japan and U.S. and freeing up that capital. And in some cases, we retain that capital to support our SMR ratios. That's being done on a block-by-block basis, as you know. So it requires assessing each block. And as you move forward and look at additional blocks, the level of complexity increases. And depending on the block of business, you may even see pricing differences, i.e. reinsurance getting more pricey. The reason I point out that complexity in some of the pricing is that it really goes to the main motivation, which is if we're going to go in and unlock additional capital, we want to make sure that we can generate very attractive returns on the deployment of that capital. And so I view that exercise of unlocking excess capital over and above our free cash flow as somewhat opportunistic. We want to see good, attractive excess returns. Now that may be in the form of buying back our stock, but it may be other opportunities. And we want that optionality to look at it. The key is it's available. It's available for the defensive measures. It's available to reinvest back in our model. It's available to take advantage of opportunities, but the key is driving excess capital with that release.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Randy Binner (Analysts)】\nI was hoping a follow-up on the new third sector product commentary. Is there any help you can give us on understanding what that might look like?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Amos (Executives)】\nUnfortunately, Randy, we can't comment on that at this time. All I can tell you is that we continue to look at third sector products because of their product characteristics, the strong profitability, and we will be looking to enter a potential product there. But we have to work with our regulators as well as finalizing that product, and we'll look to hopefully launch that sometime in 2016.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Randy Binner (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then sticking with sales on the U.S. side, the range of 3% to 7% is pretty wide. But what would have to happen, I guess, for you to hit the high end, the 7%? Can you walk us through what all needs to go right for that to happen in 2016?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Teresa White (Executives)】\n2016 range, I believe I meant to say 3% to 5% -- I never [ph] said 3% to 7%, but the slide deck has the appropriate number. But it's 3% to 5%. And the changes that we've made with the distribution and the growth that we're seeing from a broker perspective, we believe, as we continue to mature, our market offices continue to mature, that we will be on track with meeting the high end of that range.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Daniel Amos (Executives)】\nLet me make a comment about U.S. sales. I don't think our biggest challenge is external. I believe it's been internal. One thing I think Teresa has done a stellar job of is we are -- we've got 2 now separate distribution channels. You go back 4 or 5 years ago, we really only had one, and that was our field force, which is very important to us. And it's still the foundation on which everything has been built. But as we're writing the bigger accounts with the brokers, in the past, there has been real conflict. And what we've tried to do is to bring them together as one and use our field force in certain cases to help with the enrollment. And it's working out quite well. The easiest thing we could have done was to have had 2 separate companies, kept them totally apart. The problem was everybody wanted the Aflac brand. So we couldn't separate them. Everyone wanted it. So we brought them together, which has created internal conflict over the last couple of years. It is much, much better. And I give Teresa and Andy and everyone else credit for helping that come together. But it is still -- it's been years of competitiveness, let's call it. And it doesn't just go away overnight. You have to work through it, as you all know. And so that's one of the challenges. So as we continue to make and show examples of people working together and writing big accounts, it's going to only open the door. And then as we are driving our new associates and others to writing the 100 or less, which we've been working on for a couple of years, and as we work on getting the big accounts to be written with the large brokers through the group platform, that continues to work well. The area that's still the conflict is the 100 to about the 1,000 accounts, and those are the ones that we deal with. So as we work through that, I think the opportunity for future growth is tremendous. And again, I give Teresa credit for fighting that battle because it isn't an easy one because they've been in a competitive environment since inception of the company. So I do think it's coming together. Watch out when it does because that's when you'll see the growth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Randy Binner (Analysts)】\nAnd one more on U.S. sales. And sorry if I missed it, but I mean, how significant is the everwell piece of that? I mean, because most of what -- most of what you're talking about is kind of the traditional sales organization and the changes that have been made there over the last year. But is -- with everwell, I believe you're going to hit the high end of the 2017 sales guidance as -- maybe if that was higher, does that become more material then?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Teresa White (Executives)】\nAbsolutely. everwell becomes very material. One of the things that we're seeing with our adoption of everwell, especially during the pilot, we see a 40% increase in penetration when people utilize everwell. So it positions us quite nicely with the Affordable Care Act, where we have major medical and the high-deductible health plans being presented alongside voluntary. So it gives the small-case market something that they've not had, which is an opportunity to shop for their coverage on one exchange that allows them to see voluntary and major medical.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jay Gelb (Analysts)】\nI was -- I want to turn back to Slide 17 if we could, the key assumptions on earnings drivers. I'm trying to understand the comment that Aflac expects current benefit ratios in the U.S. and Japan to benefit from favorable claims trends. But at the same time, it looks like the benefit ratio, 2016 relative to 2015, this can be largely unchanged.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frederick Crawford (Executives)】\nYes. And that's in -- what we're saying there is if you go back to FAB, the FAB Meeting, this year, I'd call your attention to some of the long ranges -- or long-term ranges that we put in for benefit ratios both in the U.S. and Japan. And what you will notice is that, year-to-date in 2015, we've been tracking in a fairly material way at a favorable -- the favorable end of those ranges. And really, what we're saying in our 2016 projections is that relative to our year-to-date performance, we would expect to move forward with continued favorability. Now it moves a little bit from what we're seeing year-to-date, but realize how much more favorable it is relative to our FAB guidance. So for example, our guidance on U.S. benefit ratios at FAB was 50% to 52%. We've been, year-to-date, tracking very low at roughly 48%, and we're suggesting 47% to 49% as the range. So that's really what I mean by that comment. It's the continuation of what we believe to be really favorable or net favorable performance in 2015.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jay Gelb (Analysts)】\nAll right. Thanks for clarifying that. And then on the Japan Post opportunity, I guess following up on an earlier question, I would have thought that, that would have continued momentum into 2016. Am I thinking about that the wrong way?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Amos (Executives)】\nUnfortunately, we cannot comment on Japan Post. I can tell you that we continue to be very happy with the relationship. We continue to succeed in not only the implementation of the 20,000 post offices but the use of the additional product and -- as well as the Aflac core product and the sale of that channel, along with selling to combo [ph] insurance. And all 3 of those continue to meet or exceed our expectations, and we're happy with what's happening there. At the same time, we can't give any comments on specifics or numbers related to our Japan Post relationship.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Berg (Analysts)】\nIn Japan, the next year, you've indicated that you plan to focus, at least on the life insurance side if I understand your comments correctly, on level-premium as opposed to the single premium. To me, this sounds like primitive life insurance and that you'll be going head-to-head against companies whose brand's in this area than with largest career-agent-oriented companies in the country, whose brands are as strong as yours are in that corner of the market. So my one question is twofold. One, what is Aflac's history in successfully selling level-premium FIRST sector products? To what extent have you done them? And to what extent have you been successful? And why should we think that, given the different competitive nature and the relative less strength of your brand in the first sector market and the third sector, that you can be successful?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Amos (Executives)】\nThis is Paul, Eric. Let me say that our exclusive agencies have always been offered a well-rounded product portfolio that was, of course, driven first and foremost by third sector products beginning with cancer and now medical but also with first sector products, both lump sum and level-premium. And as I have said on several calls, we have made a commitment to continue to offer those to our exclusive agencies, all forms of those products, because we believe that is what's necessary for them to be competitive in the marketplace and part of their commitment to us by providing us the exclusivity of only offering Aflac products. What we are saying, however, is that in the highly competitive bank channel and other markets, when it comes to lump sum premium products, we believe we want to significantly deemphasize those products. We're taking measures in order to continue the decline in the sale of those products, but we have seen such a high cross-sell ratio between our level-premium first sector as well to our third sector products by our associates and other traditional channels that we believe that selling those products is not only an enhancement because it exceeds our cost of capital, but it's also an enhancement because it drives the additional premium at the higher profit margin that we're achieving through the third sector sale.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Berg (Analysts)】\nIf I could just get one in quickly actually for Teresa, and it is that I have always looked at your tally, your regularly reported tally of producing agents because I've just viewed that, historically, as an important indicator of the future of sales. Those numbers have not been going in the right direction. They've been declining in the United States for some time. As we look forward into 2016 -- whether you, Teresa or Dan or whoever feels appropriate to answer this question, will then -- will the count of producing agents be as important in terms of understanding Aflac in the future as it was in the past? And what should we expect for this, this census, this count of producing agents?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Teresa White (Executives)】\nEric, this is Teresa. One of the things that I've discussed in the past is how the bifurcation of the model, creating the career agent distribution and then separating it from the broker distribution, will, I think, help you in doing exactly what you're attempting to do. One of the things that we've done this year is we started to separate those, and yes, we will continue to drive career recruiting. Today, that number is a holistic number that represents career recruiting and brokers. And what we wanted to do is we wanted to separate those numbers. And I believe in 2016, that's the plan -- and Robin is shaking her head yes, that's our plan for the briefing go forward. We have this year where we basically had to settle in and get everybody in the right bucket. But from there, go forward, the plan is to continue career recruiting. And then you heard me express, from a broker perspective, deepening the relationship with our current, existing brokers. We will continue to grow our broker relationships, but quite frankly, what I wanted to concentrate on in 2015 and in 2016 is deepening the relationship that we have with our current broker partners. We have a number of broker partners out there that we're not selling a lot of Aflac insurance. And I think there is tremendous opportunity there, and so that's the plan.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Weiss (Analysts)】\nI'd like to follow up on the discussion around margins. Could you clarify exactly what the dynamics are that are going to lead to, again, beneficial experience in 2016? And then maybe more specifically, what it is you're expecting that changes in actually 2017 and beyond that causes that to come back down to the margin ranges that you gave earlier this year at FAB?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frederick Crawford (Executives)】\nSure. Seth, it's Fred. A couple of things. So in Japan, what we're seeing is really predominantly a continuation of the favorable experience we've been enjoying really in the cancer block of business. And as that continues, we would expect that to generate the lower end of the benefit ratio. And if you recall back to our third quarter discussion, you have a couple of dynamics going on there. Not only do you have favorable claims dynamics due to hospitalization rates and other issues that are trending in Japan, but you also have to constantly review and look at your reserving dynamics as well, IBNR and the like. And so it's not uncommon for us to see quarter-to-quarter benefits from both the trends and the review of the reserves, particularly year-to-year. So that's really what's driving Japan. Otherwise, we see relative stability across the other lines of business in terms of benefit ratio, including first sector, which, as you know, carries naturally higher benefit ratio and lower expense ratio. In the U.S., it's really a general continuation of good performance, nothing unusual spiking out in 2016, just an overall continuation as we track that business. I think that the bigger mover to pay attention to in the U.S. as it relates to margins is actually the expense ratio. As I noted in my comments, it remains a little elevated, about 100 basis points or so elevated, and that's actually predominantly due to what Teresa commented on in terms of our proactive need to invest in both IT, automation and end-to-end administration around our fast-growing, broker-driven group product sales. And so that is really a proactive decision on our part, which adds about 80 basis points to our expense ratio but obviously has very tight return on investment characteristics with it as we roll forward. What I would comment on in terms of 2017 and '18 is we'll obviously refresh all of our margin views at this year's FAB and roll forward a 3-year look. And so yes, at the moment, we're sticking with the current ranges that were discussed earlier in the year, but obviously, as we grow quarter-to-quarter and year-by-year, we'll continue to review those trends and whether or not we expect them to stay around longer or deteriorate or improve.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Weiss (Analysts)】\nOkay. So is it fair to categorize those longer-term trends that there's some conservatism built in, a provision for that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frederick Crawford (Executives)】\nSure. I mean, when we use the term favorable, what we're suggesting to you is that indeed, they're running favorable to what we otherwise would have expected over a long run. And that is true. And we've been enjoying that in 2015. You've seen that in our results. And so as we sit here today, we think we are traveling on the favorable end of benefit ratios both in Japan and in the U.S. And that should be noted. But we're going to continue to monitor that for what we think is more sustainable going forward or whether or not we would see some natural leakage. Keep in mind that when I think about these benefit ratios, these are still supporting extremely strong return on equity and return on overall IRRs on all of our voluntary supplemental health businesses.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gallagher (Analysts)】\nFred, the -- I wanted to discuss Japan revenues. I know you mentioned NII is expected to be down a bit, and you mentioned what you expect on overall margins in Japan. How about premium revenue growth in '16 versus '15?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frederick Crawford (Executives)】\nSure, a couple of things and then I will, maybe, add a little more color on the NII in the process, too. But in terms of Japan revenue, a couple of things to be mindful of. I think it's natural for you to come to the table, saying -- coming up with particularly a year of very strong sales in the third sector that we would see a little more robust growth in Japan revenue. But we've got a couple of things going on. One is mass, meaning with the very, very large in-force size of our business that's generating in and around JPY 1.5 trillion a year of earned premium, when you have even the very strong persistency we enjoy or roughly, say, 5% lapse rates, you've got to have one whole heck of a growth engine, if you will, to just keep pace with the natural lapsation. For example, if you look at third sector, we would expect to see something in the way of 5% natural runoff or lapsation, and that's on a JPY 1.1 trillion earned premium book. And so that suggests to you that your third sector sales engine alone needs to be doing much better than JPY 55 billion or JPY 60 billion of sales just to keep some growth rate going. Now as you look more expansive -- and the good news is that Paul and his team have generated a very good engine. I mean, if you look at that chart, if you go back a couple of years, the distribution platform was generating in and around JPY 60 billion to JPY 65 billion a year of new sales. That engine now, even as we look forward to 2016, is now approaching a $75 billion to as high as $80 billion (sic) [ JPY 75 billion to as high as JPY 80 billion ] distribution engine, and that's going to serve to help grow third sector premium. Earned premium in and around the 1.5% to 2% range would be my estimate. When you look at first sector, however, you've got a couple of things going on. One, naturally, you're going to see premium come down because as Paul has outlined, we're refining our approach to it, moving away from lump sum. But the other thing you have going on is you also have some of the more limited pay product. If you recall back to this year's FAB Meeting, we have limited pay product. When it reaches paid-up status, you'll see a more drop-off in the premium levels. And in fact, moving from 2015 to '16, we're seeing about JPY 30 billion of drop-off just related to the paid-up status of this limited premium pay product. Now again, remember, that doesn't impact profitability because we have a liability that we release into earnings, which keeps profitability constant, but it does pressure premium. So when you think of the combination of reinsurance, which is now tailing off, we had reinsurance effect this year compared to next year probably around JPY 5 billion or so of depressed growth related to reinsurance. If you look at that plus the first sector, plus the limited pay product now starting to reach paid-up status, all of those things are contributing to a muted premium growth rate in Japan.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gallagher (Analysts)】\nAnd Fred, if you just -- following you on that math with the JPY 30 billion drop-off, are we getting like a point or 2 of a decline in premium revenue? Was that directionally close?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frederick Crawford (Executives)】\nYes. If you just isolate first sector business, which runs about JPY 0.5 billion a year in earned premium, that -- just that paid-up status is contributing to roughly a 1% decline year-over-year in the earned premium. That's for '16.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gallagher (Analysts)】\nGot it. And you said third sector is supposed to grown 1.5% to 2%. So is it fair to say that you'd still get -- you get kind of flattish to maybe modest growth overall then?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frederick Crawford (Executives)】\nWell, as I said in my comments, we're expecting about 1% growth in premium overall.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gallagher (Analysts)】\n1% growth, got it, okay. That's helpful color. I appreciate it. And then just my follow-up is, on the -- in terms of the product shift, moving away from lump sum sales in first sector, can you all remind us what percent of Japanese sales this year in first sector were lump sum versus level pay?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frederick Crawford (Executives)】\nI don't have that handy. I don't know if any -- if -- Paul, if you happen to have that handy or not?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Amos (Executives)】\nWe're looking for it right here, just 1 second.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frederick Crawford (Executives)】\nI'm thinking roughly 1/3.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gallagher (Analysts)】\n1/3 would have been lump sum? Or 1/3 would have been level pay?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frederick Crawford (Executives)】\n1/3 lump sum.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gallagher (Analysts)】\n1/3 lump sum, got it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robin Wilkey (Executives)】\nAnd if we need to correct that, Tom, we'll do that. We'll look at it and verify that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gallagher (Analysts)】\nOkay.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Amos (Executives)】\nReally quickly, just looking in our projections, just to verify, it's about half and half. It's split almost down the middle on premium, on an AP basis.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gallagher (Analysts)】\nAnd -- Paul, and that roughly half of the first sector sales, is that going to go to 0? Is that -- or is that just a substantial decline but you'll still have some level of lump sum sales?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Amos (Executives)】\nWe are going to have some for a couple of different reasons, Tom. First of all, as I mentioned earlier, when Eric asked, we're going to continue to allow our exclusive agencies to offer that lump sum product because they have to have it in order to be competitive, but we are going to significantly change certain rate in order to make that happen. At the same time, we also have commitments to the bank channel, and those commitments tend to last 6 months at a time. And so we'll continue to see that happen through the first quarter of next year because as you know, the Japan fiscal calendar begins April 1. And so we'll probably see a slower tapering in the first quarter with a faster tapering beyond the first quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Suneet Kamath (Analysts)】\nA question on Japan sales and the long-term target of 4% to 6% for the third sector. It just seems like in recent years, we've been experiencing really strong growth in a particular year when you've had a new product introduction and then when you faced comps that were difficult in the subsequent year, had less robust sales growth. So I guess my question is, as we think about this 4% to 6% long-term guidance and the shortening product cycle that the industry is experiencing, Paul, do you think that we can get to a point where you're generating 4% to 6% third sector sales growth on a consistent basis?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Amos (Executives)】\nThat would certainly be the ideal situation. That said, certain products are going to have a higher level of attractiveness than others. The reaction to our cancer plan exceeded all of our expectations, and we certainly want to take that premium and offer those products that exceeded our total sales number. What I would tell you is that one of the reasons we'd like to enter an additional product line in the third sector is we'd like to see our vision on an annual basis on a 3-year cycle. And so if we add 3 core products in third sector with 1 product revision every year, that would put a -- hopefully, a smoother number for us in attempting to achieve that CAGR. That said, it's very difficult to predict market receptiveness, but that is the objective. As I said, part of the reason this year that we not only face difficult comps but in trying to launch a brand new product in an industry and in -- with a sales distribution that tends to be slower to adapt new products as opposed to new product revisions, we're just trying to be mindful of that as we head into 2016 and think that we can prepare ourselves better for the longer term in achieving that CAGR.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Daniel Amos (Executives)】\nI want to say something. Suneet, this is Dan. In the old days, I would have had a contest that started in the first quarter to shift some of the business from the fourth quarter to the first quarter to try to level it out. It was a conference call that we had with all of you, where everyone said, \"Get the business when you can, as quick as you can.\" And so we shifted back to getting the business as fast and as quick as we can. And we felt like it's better to have the 13% now than if we'd ended up with 6% and 5%, so -- or whatever those totals might be to sum up. But ultimately, we were just trying to get it in. So we could have made it more level by shifting the context, not literally holding business, but just shifting things. So it is our outstanding production in the fourth quarter that's causing our problem for 2016. And so I just want to be clear on that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Suneet Kamath (Analysts)】\nIt's appreciated. One quick follow-up on Japan. I know you can't give us any specifics about Japan Post, and I appreciate that. But if I go back, Dan, to the relationship that you had with Dai-ichi years ago when you first started it, my recollection is that sales growth was quite strong in that first year and then the relationship became somewhat of a drag on growth in subsequent years because even though you were generating new business, it wasn't quite at the level of that extremely strong first year. So I guess my question is directionally, should we think that Japan Post will be any different from that situation that you experienced?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Daniel Amos (Executives)】\nAnd the reason you should is with Dai-ichi Life, we hit it all at once. It's been rolled out and -- Japan Post has been rolled out by over a period of years, not just one quick shot. Will it eventually slow down? Probably so unless we come up with something else, new, innovative that we can get together with them on. But let me just say that I give our relationship with Japan Post from what I thought it would be to where it is today, an A. And that's all I can say about that. But I think Aflac Japan and the leadership that Paul and Yamauchi, the sales force, all the people, get an A on what's been going on. And our relationship is stronger today with Japan Post than it has ever been, and I look for it continuing to be strong because it's helping not only us, but it's helping Japan Post and it's helping the policyholders in Japan.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robin Wilkey (Executives)】\nThank you very much for joining us this morning.

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. \r\nRegarding the first quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.\r\nTo begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter. The first quarter has been very busy for us. We continue to organically grow our business while expanding our initiatives designed to drive sales. We expanded our U.S. retail footprint with the opening of another 22 net new stores. Our commercial business continues to gain traction, growing sales 10% with 55 net new programs opened for the quarter. \r\nWe had the commercial program in 81% of our domestic stores, and we continue to expand our presence in Mexico, opening 1 store in the quarter. Also, in Brazil, we opened an additional store and now have 8 stores in operation. Lastly, we opened 2 new IMC branches. \r\nWhile we currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores, we believe we have great growth opportunities with both electronic commerce and store openings outside the U.S. for many years to come. \r\nAlong with our key strategic investments, we continue to spend a lot of time on initiatives to drive our core domestic retail business. The DIY operations remain our #1 priority, and the business did quite well in the first quarter. We generated positive traffic and ticket on a same-store basis, and performance was generally consistent across the country. \r\nWhile the macro economy is favorable for DIY performance right now, we continue to gain share and would attribute those share gains to our investments in store labor and our inventory availability initiatives. We are committed to providing WOW! Customer Service at every store with every customer. \r\nRegarding commercial, we've continued with our inventory placement and distribution strategies to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts proliferation in the industry. Over the past 2 years, we implemented new methodologies to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. We continued the rollout of more frequent deliveries to an additional 80 net new stores in the quarter. As we discussed in our last quarterly conference call, this rollout focuses on increasing from once-a-week deliveries from our distribution centers to either 3x or 5x. \r\nOur results continued to confirm that this new strategy is appropriate. With the varying weekly sales volumes of our stores, replenishment needs vary as well. Over the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to approximately 1,000 additional stores, ending the fiscal year with approximately 2,000 stores with this enhanced service level. \r\nThe implementation of this initiative will create a gross margin headwind of approximately 30 basis points each quarter until we complete the rollout. While this effort will take a few years to complete, we would ultimately expect about 2/3 of our stores to have increased frequency in deliveries. This quarter, we only implemented this initiative in 80 net new stores. This past quarter, our focus was on rolling out multiple deliveries to our hub stores. We focused our efforts on this group of stores because they service so many other stores. \r\nAdditionally, we continue to be very pleased with our sales results from the MegaHub stores. We ended the quarter with 5 MegaHubs in operation with no new openings this quarter, although we expect to add a handful of additional MegaHubs over the balance of the fiscal year. As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs of inventory, approximately twice what a normal hub store carries. They provide coverage to most surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. \r\nOur sales results, thus far, in our open MegaHubs are exceeding our expectations. We have been pleasantly surprised to see the sales generated by the new unique SKU additions to their markets lifting both our retail and commercial businesses. \r\nWhile there's incremental cost to these rollouts and payroll and fuel to execute the extra deliveries, we feel their cost deleverage is relatively modest. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2016. \r\nCurrently, 5 MegaHubs support approximately 2,000 stores on a same-day or overnight basis. And once built out, we'd expect to have a network of MegaHubs in the neighborhood of 25 to 40 locations. Consistent with the increased frequency of delivery from our distribution centers, we expect to complete our MegaHub expansion over the next few years.\r\nWe also continued to roll out our new store prototype that significantly expands the hard part holding capacity in our stores. All new stores are opening now with this new prototype, and we've remodeled 29 additional constrained stores and now have 126 completed locations. Each of these efforts that are focused on improving our availability of inventory have resulted in an increase to our store-level inventories. They've also added incremental costs. Sales have justified our investments though and offered convincing proof that we remain on the right track.\r\nAlong with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders.\r\nAs I mentioned a few minutes ago, we continue to invest in store labor in order to say, \"Yes! We've Got It.\" more frequently. \"Yes! We've Got It.\" is a new operating mantra for us in 2016. We've made material and meaningful enhancements in the last few years to our availability of inventory, and now it is time to ensure our customers' experience and see that substantial change. \r\nWith traffic up across our stores, we understand and appreciate the need to be appropriately staffed to handle our customers' needs. When a customer has a request for a part, product or simply advice, our objective is to say to them, \"Yes! We've Got It.\" While early in the implementation phase, our team has enthusiastically embraced this notion. And with the current positive macro environment, we want to make sure our AutoZoners have the tools and specifically the staff necessary to provide our customers with WOW! Customer Service experience they deserve.\r\nWe also continue to make significant investments -- systems investments and enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We believe it is essential to be able to share information and processes seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs. \r\nWhile we are in the early stages of this work, we believe having a holistic and seamless enterprise-wide perspective of our customers will benefit us greatly over the next several years. In order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as the MegaHubs, we expect to open 2 or 3 distribution centers over the next 2 or 3 years. \r\nFor your modeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost from $40 million to $45 million. At present, we are in the early stages of planning their openings, and we don't expect any domestic distribution center to come online until early fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 will incur some capital and operating expenses related to development, but the larger portion of capital spend will be in fiscal 2017 and '18.\r\nTo summarize our plans, we expect to roll out more frequent distribution center deliveries and more MegaHub locations over the next few years. We also expect to open 2 or 3 new domestic distribution centers over this time. While our total company CapEx will not be materially different this year from the past, we do expect to incur an approximate 20 to 30 basis point gross margin headwind from these investments alone. \r\nIn fiscal year 2015, we faced headwinds to our gross margin, and we were able to overcome them and post improvements in each of our quarters. We believe, in fiscal 2016, we continue to have opportunities for improvement but we also have new headwinds.\r\nNow turning to the first quarter's results. Our sales increased 5.6% on top of 8% growth in Q1 of last year. Our domestic same-store sales were up 3.5%. This quarter's sales results were very consistent throughout the quarter, excluding the last 2 weeks. The last 2 weeks of Q1 last year were particularly strong due to the extreme cold across much of the country. Remember the polar vortex? Every year, when the first significant cold spell arrives, we experience significant growth in hard part sales, and customers are reminded of the importance of doing the maintenance work necessary to prepare their vehicles for the winter driving season. \r\nLast year, that first cold weather event was pulled forward into Q1 when it usually occurs early in Q2. While weather is always an important factor for sales, over time, the impact evens out. Regionally, the Northwest, Northeast and Midwest performed slightly below the overall chain. However, these 2 markets were better the year before. \r\nIn regard to our 3 primary merchandise category splits, discretionary product sales performed the best, maintenance followed and then failure-related merchandise. We attribute the recent strength in discretionary category to be due to lower gas prices freeing up money for our customers. \r\nWhile important, discretionary remains our lowest mix of sales, approximately 80% of total domestic store sales. So the impact of accelerated growth in these categories is not the most significant driver of our overall sales. \r\nWe are still a failure parts-driven retailer, representing approximately 50% of total sales. And the lack of early winter this year muted our sales in failure-related categories. As I said earlier, both traffic and ticket were positive for our DIY and commercial businesses. \r\nFor the quarter, we opened 55 net new programs in commercial and have the commercial program in 81% of our domestic store base. While our sales grew 10% on the quarter, our programs opened grew by 7%.\r\nWhile the commercial business -- commercial sales growth rate was a bit slower than last quarter's pace, we continue to be pleased with the progress we are making. We believe our future in this business remains bright. \r\nAs part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter, we opened 2 additional hub locations and now operate 178 traditional hubs. In addition to our opening more MegaHub locations, we also expect to open additional standard hub locations. Over time, we expect to operate as many as 200 to 225 stores as hubs.\r\nRegarding IMC, we opened 2 new branches this quarter and are excited by our opportunities. This year, IMC will be busy. We'll open a few more locations this year and expand access to their original equipment inventory to more AutoZone stores. The IMC parts catalog is accessible to around 600 AutoZone locations today, so we see great sales growth opportunities in the future for both our retail and commercial customers. \r\nRegarding Mexico, we opened 1 store this quarter and now have 442 total locations. While foreign currency headwinds persist, Mexico's peso sales have done well. Assuming the peso stabilizes, we expect the pressure on U.S. dollar earnings from our Mexico business to abate starting next summer in the June, July time frame as we begin to lap the exchange rate increases. \r\nFor the quarter, the foreign currency headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by more than a percentage point. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 4% over last year. As a reminder, ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses -- as a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. Regarding online sales opportunities, there continue to be great opportunities for growth on both a business-to-business basis and to individual customers, or B2C.\r\nWith the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices on average are down materially, miles driven continue to increase. The lower-income customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging. \r\nWhile we understand recent weather has been warmer and we're up against a quite cold winter last year, we are still optimistic we can grow sales for upcoming quarters. While we focus on both short-term and long-term performance, we remain committed to delivering consistent strong earnings performance and extending our streak of 37 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth is an important milestone for us. \r\nWhile our delivery frequency initiative and expansion of our MegaHubs will add some headwinds on our operating margin for the remainder of the fiscal year, our focus remains growing operating profit dollars at acceptable return levels. \r\nNow let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, Live the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were: Great People Providing Great Service!; profitably growing our commercial business; leveraging the Internet; improving inventory availability; and \"Yes! We've Got It.\" \r\nOn the retail front this past quarter under the Great People Providing Great Service! priority, we increased staffing levels in our stores. We've also been focused on improving our mobile app and autozone.com to increase our relevancy across our fastest-growing online category. We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a long-term basis. \r\nWe realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead the sales growth across all of our businesses. On the \"Yes! We've Got It.\" front, we've added training, metrics, and most importantly, share of voice to educate our store-level AutoZoners to help all of our customers with any part, product or advice needs they have. We are very excited about what this initiative can mean.\r\nWe should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish the quarter at 31.2%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of Hardlines retail. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. \r\nBefore I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank our entire organization for their commitment to managing the business appropriately and prudently. \r\nNow I'll turn it over to Bill.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 22 IMC branches, increased 5.6%. \r\nNow switching over to macro trends. During the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $2.51 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.09 a gallon, $0.42 decrease. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.64 per gallon during the first quarter, starting at $3.46 and ending at $2.82 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles. And as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income.\r\nWe also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 11 years old, the current average is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 2.3% in August and 4.3% in September. Now we don't have October or November data yet. The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-and-older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor.\r\nFor the trailing 4 quarters, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,773,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry. \r\nFor the quarter, total commercial sales increased 10%. In the first quarter, commercial represented 18% of our total sales and grew $39 million over last year's Q1. While the sales trajectory of the business slowed a bit in Q1, we are continuing our efforts to grow this business. This past quarter, we opened 55 new programs versus 61 programs opened in our first quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,196 stores supported by 178 hub stores. Approximately 1,106 of our programs are 3 years old or younger or 26% of the base.\r\nLet me take a moment and discuss our commercial program performance. While our average weekly sales per program for the last 12 months are below some peers in our industry at $8,800, our productivity continues to improve. Our focus remains on growing both sales and profits at an accelerated rate compared to our retail business. \r\nLooking specifically at mature programs, those at least 5 years old, they averaged $10,000 per week this past year and grew mid-single digit over last year. While we will continue to open additional programs over the next several years, we will remain focused on improving the productivity of all of our existing programs. We also feel very good about the success we've had in profitably growing the commercial business.\r\nWith our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisition, we are well positioned to grow our base business. Over the last several years, a significant amount of our focus has been on opening new programs and that will continue to be the case albeit at a slightly moderated pace. We have a very talented sales force, and we are enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. \r\nIn summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share. We believe we can scale this business in a profitable manner and are excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come.\r\nOur Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 1 new store during the first quarter. We currently have 442 stores in Mexico. For the year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores, and we are on target to open a new distribution center. This will mark our second DC in the country and support Central Mexico store growth. \r\nWhile sales in base currency were above plan this past quarter, the devaluation in the peso remains a material headwind to U.S. dollars reported for operating profit. The peso finished Q1 21% below last year's quarter end rate. This weakness created a significant headwind on our reported U.S. dollars and EBIT. \r\nAs Bill previously mentioned, for the quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by more than 1 percentage point. While we cannot control movements in functional currency versus planned assumptions, the Mexico leadership continues to do an excellent job managing the peso-denominated business. As the peso stays at these elevated levels, it will continue to pressure our U.S. dollar earnings for the next few quarters.\r\nNow regarding Brazil, we opened 1 store in the quarter resulting in 8 stores opened at the end of the quarter. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars as well. While the peso devalued 21%, the real devalued 48% this year versus last. This extraordinary volatility was managed as best as possible. We remain in test phase in Brazil, but have been encouraged by our operating performance.  \r\nRecapping this past quarter's performance for the company. In total, our sales were $2,386,000,000, an increase of 5.6% over last year's first quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than 1 year were up 3.5% for the quarter. \r\nGross margin for the quarter was 52.5% of sales, up 45 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives. \r\nIn regards to inflation, it remains subdued at basically a flat level to last year across merchandise categories with pockets of deflation. Currently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. \r\nLooking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses. But our commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate and it has lower margins, which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins. It is important to note, we do not manage to target a gross margin percentage. And we also understand the headwinds expanding our distribution center deliveries will cause. We will continue to work diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lower acquisition costs. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.\r\nSG&A for the quarter was 34.2% of sales, higher by 17 basis points from last year's first quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher domestic payroll and the impact of IMC, which were partially offset by the favorable comparison to last year's higher legal cost. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. \r\nEBIT for the quarter was $438 million, up 7.2% over last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin was 18.4%. Interest expense for the quarter was $35 million compared with $37.1 million in Q1 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,754,000,000 or approximately $350 million more than last year's balance of $4,402,000,000. \r\nOur adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.\r\nFor the quarter, our tax rate was slightly higher than last year's Q1 tax rate. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.5% on an ongoing basis as the deviation result is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arise.\r\nNet income for the quarter was $258 million and up 8.3% over last year. Our diluted share count of 31.1 million was down 5% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $8.29, up 14% over the prior year's first quarter. \r\nRelating to the cash flow statement, for the first fiscal quarter, we generated $324 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $87 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 27 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and MegaHub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. \r\nWith the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,163 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 442 stores in Mexico and 8 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 5,613. We also had 22 IMC branches opened at fiscal quarter end, taking our total locations to 5,635.\r\nDepreciation totaled $66 million for the quarter versus last year's first quarter expense of $61 million, in line with recent quarter growth rates. \r\nWith our excess cash flow, we repurchased $400 million of AutoZone stock in the first quarter. At quarter end, we have $698 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.5x at year-end. Again, I want to stress we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. \r\nAccounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 110.6%. \r\nNext, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-location basis. The company's inventory increased 7.2% over the same period last year, driven by increased product placement and new stores during the fiscal year. Inventory per location was $624,000 versus $604,000 last year and $610,000 last quarter.\r\nFinally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.2%. We have and we'll continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.\r\nNow I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Bill. We are very pleased to report our 37th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 14% over last year. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. While we study the external environment and react where appropriate, we must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail and exceptional execution. \r\nWe are confident in our initiatives, and we are pleased with the progress we are making in rolling out our new supply chain model by delivering inventory to our stores on a more frequent basis. In addition, the performance of our MegaHubs has been strong, and we look forward to opening more. We believe these initiatives will benefit both our retail and commercial businesses. \r\nOur long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. \r\nWe feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning in the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is that solid consistent strategy, combined with superior execution, drives success. \r\nOur charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past quarter, but we must not be content. We have a lot of work in front of us over the next 3 quarters, but the future looks bright.\r\nBefore moving to the Q&A section, I'd like to address some of our recent organizational changes. In late September, Larry Roesel informed us that he was retiring this fall. Larry led our commercial business for 8.5 years, and we experienced tremendous growth during his tenure. We thank Larry for his incredible contributions to our success and wish he and his wife, Beverly, all the best in retirement. \r\nAdditionally, Mike Womack recently informed us that he and his family will be moving back to their home in Ohio. Mike has led our Human Resources organization for 3.5 years. Under his leadership, our HR processes have continued to improve. We wish Mike and his family all the best as they return home.\r\nIn light of these changes, we have elevated 3 long-term AutoZoners to Executive Vice President, and we've promoted 5 AutoZoners to Senior Vice President. I am very excited about these individuals, their promotions and the impact they will have on our business. These are very talented leaders, and they have tremendous AutoZone tenure. On average, these 8 AutoZone leaders have over 25 years of AutoZone tenure. This is a great testament to our unique and powerful culture, and it highlights that our diligent work around succession planning is paying dividends. \r\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions.",

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. \r\nRegarding the first quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.\r\nTo begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter. The first quarter has been very busy for us. We continue to organically grow our business while expanding our initiatives designed to drive sales. We expanded our U.S. retail footprint with the opening of another 22 net new stores. Our commercial business continues to gain traction, growing sales 10% with 55 net new programs opened for the quarter. \r\nWe had the commercial program in 81% of our domestic stores, and we continue to expand our presence in Mexico, opening 1 store in the quarter. Also, in Brazil, we opened an additional store and now have 8 stores in operation. Lastly, we opened 2 new IMC branches. \r\nWhile we currently have approximately 90% of our total company sales coming from our domestic AutoZone stores, we believe we have great growth opportunities with both electronic commerce and store openings outside the U.S. for many years to come. \r\nAlong with our key strategic investments, we continue to spend a lot of time on initiatives to drive our core domestic retail business. The DIY operations remain our #1 priority, and the business did quite well in the first quarter. We generated positive traffic and ticket on a same-store basis, and performance was generally consistent across the country. \r\nWhile the macro economy is favorable for DIY performance right now, we continue to gain share and would attribute those share gains to our investments in store labor and our inventory availability initiatives. We are committed to providing WOW! Customer Service at every store with every customer. \r\nRegarding commercial, we've continued with our inventory placement and distribution strategies to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts proliferation in the industry. Over the past 2 years, we implemented new methodologies to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. We continued the rollout of more frequent deliveries to an additional 80 net new stores in the quarter. As we discussed in our last quarterly conference call, this rollout focuses on increasing from once-a-week deliveries from our distribution centers to either 3x or 5x. \r\nOur results continued to confirm that this new strategy is appropriate. With the varying weekly sales volumes of our stores, replenishment needs vary as well. Over the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect to roll this increased frequency model to approximately 1,000 additional stores, ending the fiscal year with approximately 2,000 stores with this enhanced service level. \r\nThe implementation of this initiative will create a gross margin headwind of approximately 30 basis points each quarter until we complete the rollout. While this effort will take a few years to complete, we would ultimately expect about 2/3 of our stores to have increased frequency in deliveries. This quarter, we only implemented this initiative in 80 net new stores. This past quarter, our focus was on rolling out multiple deliveries to our hub stores. We focused our efforts on this group of stores because they service so many other stores. \r\nAdditionally, we continue to be very pleased with our sales results from the MegaHub stores. We ended the quarter with 5 MegaHubs in operation with no new openings this quarter, although we expect to add a handful of additional MegaHubs over the balance of the fiscal year. As a reminder, these supersized AutoZone stores carry 80,000 to 100,000 unique SKUs of inventory, approximately twice what a normal hub store carries. They provide coverage to most surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis. \r\nOur sales results, thus far, in our open MegaHubs are exceeding our expectations. We have been pleasantly surprised to see the sales generated by the new unique SKU additions to their markets lifting both our retail and commercial businesses. \r\nWhile there's incremental cost to these rollouts and payroll and fuel to execute the extra deliveries, we feel their cost deleverage is relatively modest. Our current assumption on this rollout is that we won't experience meaningful deleverage from this initiative in fiscal 2016. \r\nCurrently, 5 MegaHubs support approximately 2,000 stores on a same-day or overnight basis. And once built out, we'd expect to have a network of MegaHubs in the neighborhood of 25 to 40 locations. Consistent with the increased frequency of delivery from our distribution centers, we expect to complete our MegaHub expansion over the next few years.\r\nWe also continued to roll out our new store prototype that significantly expands the hard part holding capacity in our stores. All new stores are opening now with this new prototype, and we've remodeled 29 additional constrained stores and now have 126 completed locations. Each of these efforts that are focused on improving our availability of inventory have resulted in an increase to our store-level inventories. They've also added incremental costs. Sales have justified our investments though and offered convincing proof that we remain on the right track.\r\nAlong with improving our local parts availability and assortment, we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement and ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders.\r\nAs I mentioned a few minutes ago, we continue to invest in store labor in order to say, \"Yes! We've Got It.\" more frequently. \"Yes! We've Got It.\" is a new operating mantra for us in 2016. We've made material and meaningful enhancements in the last few years to our availability of inventory, and now it is time to ensure our customers' experience and see that substantial change. \r\nWith traffic up across our stores, we understand and appreciate the need to be appropriately staffed to handle our customers' needs. When a customer has a request for a part, product or simply advice, our objective is to say to them, \"Yes! We've Got It.\" While early in the implementation phase, our team has enthusiastically embraced this notion. And with the current positive macro environment, we want to make sure our AutoZoners have the tools and specifically the staff necessary to provide our customers with WOW! Customer Service experience they deserve.\r\nWe also continue to make significant investments -- systems investments and enhancements to capture data about our customers' shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We believe it is essential to be able to share information and processes seamlessly between our stores, commercial shops, phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers' needs. \r\nWhile we are in the early stages of this work, we believe having a holistic and seamless enterprise-wide perspective of our customers will benefit us greatly over the next several years. In order to support more frequent deliveries to new stores as well as the MegaHubs, we expect to open 2 or 3 distribution centers over the next 2 or 3 years. \r\nFor your modeling purposes, each new distribution center is expected to cost from $40 million to $45 million. At present, we are in the early stages of planning their openings, and we don't expect any domestic distribution center to come online until early fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 will incur some capital and operating expenses related to development, but the larger portion of capital spend will be in fiscal 2017 and '18.\r\nTo summarize our plans, we expect to roll out more frequent distribution center deliveries and more MegaHub locations over the next few years. We also expect to open 2 or 3 new domestic distribution centers over this time. While our total company CapEx will not be materially different this year from the past, we do expect to incur an approximate 20 to 30 basis point gross margin headwind from these investments alone. \r\nIn fiscal year 2015, we faced headwinds to our gross margin, and we were able to overcome them and post improvements in each of our quarters. We believe, in fiscal 2016, we continue to have opportunities for improvement but we also have new headwinds.\r\nNow turning to the first quarter's results. Our sales increased 5.6% on top of 8% growth in Q1 of last year. Our domestic same-store sales were up 3.5%. This quarter's sales results were very consistent throughout the quarter, excluding the last 2 weeks. The last 2 weeks of Q1 last year were particularly strong due to the extreme cold across much of the country. Remember the polar vortex? Every year, when the first significant cold spell arrives, we experience significant growth in hard part sales, and customers are reminded of the importance of doing the maintenance work necessary to prepare their vehicles for the winter driving season. \r\nLast year, that first cold weather event was pulled forward into Q1 when it usually occurs early in Q2. While weather is always an important factor for sales, over time, the impact evens out. Regionally, the Northwest, Northeast and Midwest performed slightly below the overall chain. However, these 2 markets were better the year before. \r\nIn regard to our 3 primary merchandise category splits, discretionary product sales performed the best, maintenance followed and then failure-related merchandise. We attribute the recent strength in discretionary category to be due to lower gas prices freeing up money for our customers. \r\nWhile important, discretionary remains our lowest mix of sales, approximately 80% of total domestic store sales. So the impact of accelerated growth in these categories is not the most significant driver of our overall sales. \r\nWe are still a failure parts-driven retailer, representing approximately 50% of total sales. And the lack of early winter this year muted our sales in failure-related categories. As I said earlier, both traffic and ticket were positive for our DIY and commercial businesses. \r\nFor the quarter, we opened 55 net new programs in commercial and have the commercial program in 81% of our domestic store base. While our sales grew 10% on the quarter, our programs opened grew by 7%.\r\nWhile the commercial business -- commercial sales growth rate was a bit slower than last quarter's pace, we continue to be pleased with the progress we are making. We believe our future in this business remains bright. \r\nAs part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter, we opened 2 additional hub locations and now operate 178 traditional hubs. In addition to our opening more MegaHub locations, we also expect to open additional standard hub locations. Over time, we expect to operate as many as 200 to 225 stores as hubs.\r\nRegarding IMC, we opened 2 new branches this quarter and are excited by our opportunities. This year, IMC will be busy. We'll open a few more locations this year and expand access to their original equipment inventory to more AutoZone stores. The IMC parts catalog is accessible to around 600 AutoZone locations today, so we see great sales growth opportunities in the future for both our retail and commercial customers. \r\nRegarding Mexico, we opened 1 store this quarter and now have 442 total locations. While foreign currency headwinds persist, Mexico's peso sales have done well. Assuming the peso stabilizes, we expect the pressure on U.S. dollar earnings from our Mexico business to abate starting next summer in the June, July time frame as we begin to lap the exchange rate increases. \r\nFor the quarter, the foreign currency headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by more than a percentage point. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 4% over last year. As a reminder, ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses -- as a reminder, our ALLDATA and eCommerce businesses, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales. Regarding online sales opportunities, there continue to be great opportunities for growth on both a business-to-business basis and to individual customers, or B2C.\r\nWith the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. As new vehicle sales are reaching all-time highs and gas prices on average are down materially, miles driven continue to increase. The lower-income customer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging. \r\nWhile we understand recent weather has been warmer and we're up against a quite cold winter last year, we are still optimistic we can grow sales for upcoming quarters. While we focus on both short-term and long-term performance, we remain committed to delivering consistent strong earnings performance and extending our streak of 37 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth is an important milestone for us. \r\nWhile our delivery frequency initiative and expansion of our MegaHubs will add some headwinds on our operating margin for the remainder of the fiscal year, our focus remains growing operating profit dollars at acceptable return levels. \r\nNow let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2016, Live the Pledge. The key priorities for the year were: Great People Providing Great Service!; profitably growing our commercial business; leveraging the Internet; improving inventory availability; and \"Yes! We've Got It.\" \r\nOn the retail front this past quarter under the Great People Providing Great Service! priority, we increased staffing levels in our stores. We've also been focused on improving our mobile app and autozone.com to increase our relevancy across our fastest-growing online category. We've been aggressive on our technology investments and believe these initiatives will help differentiate us on a long-term basis. \r\nWe realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead the sales growth across all of our businesses. On the \"Yes! We've Got It.\" front, we've added training, metrics, and most importantly, share of voice to educate our store-level AutoZoners to help all of our customers with any part, product or advice needs they have. We are very excited about what this initiative can mean.\r\nWe should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish the quarter at 31.2%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of Hardlines retail. However, our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital. \r\nBefore I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank our entire organization for their commitment to managing the business appropriately and prudently. \r\nNow I'll turn it over to Bill.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Giles (Executives)】\nThanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico and Brazil stores and our 22 IMC branches, increased 5.6%. \r\nNow switching over to macro trends. During the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $2.51 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.09 a gallon, $0.42 decrease. Last year, gas prices decreased $0.64 per gallon during the first quarter, starting at $3.46 and ending at $2.82 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles. And as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to continue to benefit from this increase in disposable income.\r\nWe also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 11 years old, the current average is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 2.3% in August and 4.3% in September. Now we don't have October or November data yet. The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-and-older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor.\r\nFor the trailing 4 quarters, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,773,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry. \r\nFor the quarter, total commercial sales increased 10%. In the first quarter, commercial represented 18% of our total sales and grew $39 million over last year's Q1. While the sales trajectory of the business slowed a bit in Q1, we are continuing our efforts to grow this business. This past quarter, we opened 55 new programs versus 61 programs opened in our first quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 4,196 stores supported by 178 hub stores. Approximately 1,106 of our programs are 3 years old or younger or 26% of the base.\r\nLet me take a moment and discuss our commercial program performance. While our average weekly sales per program for the last 12 months are below some peers in our industry at $8,800, our productivity continues to improve. Our focus remains on growing both sales and profits at an accelerated rate compared to our retail business. \r\nLooking specifically at mature programs, those at least 5 years old, they averaged $10,000 per week this past year and grew mid-single digit over last year. While we will continue to open additional programs over the next several years, we will remain focused on improving the productivity of all of our existing programs. We also feel very good about the success we've had in profitably growing the commercial business.\r\nWith our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisition, we are well positioned to grow our base business. Over the last several years, a significant amount of our focus has been on opening new programs and that will continue to be the case albeit at a slightly moderated pace. We have a very talented sales force, and we are enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends. \r\nIn summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share. We believe we can scale this business in a profitable manner and are excited about our opportunities in this business for many years to come.\r\nOur Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 1 new store during the first quarter. We currently have 442 stores in Mexico. For the year, we expect to open approximately 40 new stores, and we are on target to open a new distribution center. This will mark our second DC in the country and support Central Mexico store growth. \r\nWhile sales in base currency were above plan this past quarter, the devaluation in the peso remains a material headwind to U.S. dollars reported for operating profit. The peso finished Q1 21% below last year's quarter end rate. This weakness created a significant headwind on our reported U.S. dollars and EBIT. \r\nAs Bill previously mentioned, for the quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds lowered our EBIT growth rate by more than 1 percentage point. While we cannot control movements in functional currency versus planned assumptions, the Mexico leadership continues to do an excellent job managing the peso-denominated business. As the peso stays at these elevated levels, it will continue to pressure our U.S. dollar earnings for the next few quarters.\r\nNow regarding Brazil, we opened 1 store in the quarter resulting in 8 stores opened at the end of the quarter. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we have been challenged by a weak Brazilian real relative to U.S. dollars as well. While the peso devalued 21%, the real devalued 48% this year versus last. This extraordinary volatility was managed as best as possible. We remain in test phase in Brazil, but have been encouraged by our operating performance.  \r\nRecapping this past quarter's performance for the company. In total, our sales were $2,386,000,000, an increase of 5.6% over last year's first quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than 1 year were up 3.5% for the quarter. \r\nGross margin for the quarter was 52.5% of sales, up 45 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives. \r\nIn regards to inflation, it remains subdued at basically a flat level to last year across merchandise categories with pockets of deflation. Currently, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We will remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise. \r\nLooking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses. But our commercial business is growing at an accelerated rate and it has lower margins, which is adding pressure to our overall gross margins. It is important to note, we do not manage to target a gross margin percentage. And we also understand the headwinds expanding our distribution center deliveries will cause. We will continue to work diligently to offset these headwinds with a focus on lower acquisition costs. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.\r\nSG&A for the quarter was 34.2% of sales, higher by 17 basis points from last year's first quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher domestic payroll and the impact of IMC, which were partially offset by the favorable comparison to last year's higher legal cost. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment. \r\nEBIT for the quarter was $438 million, up 7.2% over last year's first quarter. Our EBIT margin was 18.4%. Interest expense for the quarter was $35 million compared with $37.1 million in Q1 a year ago. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,754,000,000 or approximately $350 million more than last year's balance of $4,402,000,000. \r\nOur adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.\r\nFor the quarter, our tax rate was slightly higher than last year's Q1 tax rate. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.5% on an ongoing basis as the deviation result is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arise.\r\nNet income for the quarter was $258 million and up 8.3% over last year. Our diluted share count of 31.1 million was down 5% from last year's first quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $8.29, up 14% over the prior year's first quarter. \r\nRelating to the cash flow statement, for the first fiscal quarter, we generated $324 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $87 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 27 new locations this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub and MegaHub store remodels or openings, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments. \r\nWith the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 5,163 stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 442 stores in Mexico and 8 in Brazil for a total AutoZone store count of 5,613. We also had 22 IMC branches opened at fiscal quarter end, taking our total locations to 5,635.\r\nDepreciation totaled $66 million for the quarter versus last year's first quarter expense of $61 million, in line with recent quarter growth rates. \r\nWith our excess cash flow, we repurchased $400 million of AutoZone stock in the first quarter. At quarter end, we have $698 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.5x at year-end. Again, I want to stress we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. \r\nAccounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 110.6%. \r\nNext, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-location basis. The company's inventory increased 7.2% over the same period last year, driven by increased product placement and new stores during the fiscal year. Inventory per location was $624,000 versus $604,000 last year and $610,000 last quarter.\r\nFinally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.2%. We have and we'll continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.\r\nNow I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nThank you, Bill. We are very pleased to report our 37th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 14% over last year. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. While we study the external environment and react where appropriate, we must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail and exceptional execution. \r\nWe are confident in our initiatives, and we are pleased with the progress we are making in rolling out our new supply chain model by delivering inventory to our stores on a more frequent basis. In addition, the performance of our MegaHubs has been strong, and we look forward to opening more. We believe these initiatives will benefit both our retail and commercial businesses. \r\nOur long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits. \r\nWe feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning in the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is that solid consistent strategy, combined with superior execution, drives success. \r\nOur charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past quarter, but we must not be content. We have a lot of work in front of us over the next 3 quarters, but the future looks bright.\r\nBefore moving to the Q&A section, I'd like to address some of our recent organizational changes. In late September, Larry Roesel informed us that he was retiring this fall. Larry led our commercial business for 8.5 years, and we experienced tremendous growth during his tenure. We thank Larry for his incredible contributions to our success and wish he and his wife, Beverly, all the best in retirement. \r\nAdditionally, Mike Womack recently informed us that he and his family will be moving back to their home in Ohio. Mike has led our Human Resources organization for 3.5 years. Under his leadership, our HR processes have continued to improve. We wish Mike and his family all the best as they return home.\r\nIn light of these changes, we have elevated 3 long-term AutoZoners to Executive Vice President, and we've promoted 5 AutoZoners to Senior Vice President. I am very excited about these individuals, their promotions and the impact they will have on our business. These are very talented leaders, and they have tremendous AutoZone tenure. On average, these 8 AutoZone leaders have over 25 years of AutoZone tenure. This is a great testament to our unique and powerful culture, and it highlights that our diligent work around succession planning is paying dividends. \r\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "My question is on multiple delivery and DC rollout. I guess, DC eventually will come into this -- I missed some of the prepared remarks, but I guess an expectation of maybe sometime late this fiscal year or next. If you think about the cadence of investment, the 20 to 30 basis points or so from supply chain, how does the DC investments play into that? Does it bump it up? Does it -- will you get some benefits -- other benefits that take it down.\n\n---\n\nYes, a couple of great questions. First of all, we will open our distribution center in Mexico, our second DC in Mexico, hopefully, by -- this fiscal year or first of next fiscal year. The 2 DCs that we're working on, domestically, currently will not open until 2017. Hopefully, one in the first or second quarter and then the second one in the third or fourth quarter. As you know, those things take time. As those distribution centers open, clearly, they will have some capital investments. But on the operating expense front, I don't think that they will be a material contributor to drive our operating expenses up or down. As we do more frequent deliveries,  they're going to have some benefits because the stem miles of the transportation routes will be shorter, but obviously they'll have incremental operating expenses of having the new facility and new management team and all those things. I think those will net out generally.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then one quick follow-up. Granted it's early days with the multiple delivery, but I imagine in store some of the inventory, the complexion is changing a little more depth to maybe less safety stock. Is that the case? How are stores acclimating to it? Are there any protocol in store to minimize disruption? And obviously, that should be translating into sales.\n\n---\n\nYes. I would say that was one of the things that we looked at when we first started our test on this program. The store operators like it. They like it a lot. Number one, when the truck comes in, it's in bite-size pieces. So it's much more easy to work into the daily activities versus being the big event of the week where they have to have all hands on deck. So they like it. Yes, it pulls down safety stock, which one of the challenges we have when we talked about our store. The future trying to eliminate some of the -- this physical constraints that we have in our stores. One thing this does is pull down the safety stock and allows us to put more parts on the shelf. So from an operating standpoint, I think it's all systems go, and they really like it.\n\n---\n\nYou had noted that the -- obviously, the commercial revenue growth of 10% is quite good. But you did note that it decelerated from previous quarters. When you look at the results for the stores that are commercial programs that are still being delivered to once a week compared to those that are on a 3- to 5-week schedule, was there a deviation in their sales performance?\n\n---\n\nYes, Dan, there's clearly a deviation. But I would say, first of all, the benefits that we see from both of the inventory availability initiatives are both on the retail side and the commercial side. I wouldn't say that those stores reacted any differently in comparison than they did in Q4, if that makes sense.\n\n---\n\nSo when you looked at the bit of moderation and revenue growth in commercial from 4Q, it was pretty much the same and whether the stores are being shipped to once a week or 3x or 5x per week.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think that's right. As a reminder, when we do the delivery frequency and the MegaHubs, we see about $1,000 to $1,500 per store if you get both elements of that. That differential seems to be confirmed in everything we've done so far, and we did see a moderation in our sales growth kind of across the board.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just one other follow-up question on the incremental commercial growth. How's that splitting out between doing more business with existing customers? Or are your salespeople now engaging new customers and making them aware of your greater capabilities? But if you could talk about how the split is developing.\n\n---\n\nI think it's a combination of both. I mean, clearly, as we mentioned, we've grown our mature programs in the mid-single-digit rate. So we're getting more productivity out of our existing base programs as they continue to mature. But clearly, with our opportunities to say \"Yes! We've Got It.\" on a more frequent basis and be able to deliver products more timely both through more frequent deliveries as well as the MegaHub network and being able to communicate that to our customers with our sales force is an important thing. We have been able to do that, and I think we'll continue to gain traction over time.\n\n---\n\nAnd if I could just sneak in real quick question. Can you remind us how much -- how important are your commercial customers at Firestone and the service part of Pep Boys to AutoZone?\n\n---\n\nWe don't talk about specifics on our commercial customers, but obviously, Firestone is one of our great customers. We appreciate their business, but I don't want to get into specifics on them. And obviously, don't do much, if any, business with Pep Boys.\n\n---\n\nIt's actually Mark Becks on for Chris. Historically, the DIY category has been sort of a flat to 1% comp industry and you guys are obviously doing much better than that. What if anything has changed on the DIY side outside of the fuel price declines? And what do you think the rate of the growth in the industry is currently?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think, clearly, we are seeing some industry strength currently. I think a part of that has to do with what's going on with gas prices. And while gas prices initially went down, you didn't see the initial correlation with miles driven increasing. But in more recent months starting really strong in the summer and continuing through September, the latest data we have available, it's showing nice strength. Over long periods of time, we've seen that has a nice correlation with our DIY industry growth. But I also say that our performance, I don't think it's solely based on industry. We talked about it in the prepared remarks. We're also gaining market share and I think a lot of these initiatives that we have in place, particularly around inventory availability, are beginning to pay dividends. And remember, we're just very early in the early innings.\n\n---\n\nAnd 2 quick follow-ups to that. Who do you think you're taking share from, whether it be on the independent or the national retailers? And then also, just with the lower gas prices, have you seen any particular lift that you might be able to quantify? Or if you've done any historical correlation? So, for instance, a 1% increase in miles driven would add 25 basis points to comps.\n\n---\n\nYes, I don't think the analysis that we have is that finite. What I would say is we would think that we're getting the benefit of 1% to 2% at this point in time in our DIY business. As for who we're gaining market share from, I don't really want to get into that. I'm more focused on are we gaining market share and what we're going to do to gain more of it.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then just last question. You spoke to still being optimistic about growing sales and then talked about a dip in trends the last 2 quarters. Can you speak to any variability by region that you saw over the last couple of weeks? I think it was 50 here in the Northeast this past weekend and it's supposed to be 60 again this weekend.\n\n---\n\nYes, thank you. Great question. Number one, we wanted to call out what happened in the last 2 weeks of the quarter because it was materially different. It wasn't materially different this year from the other weeks in the quarter. What was materially different was last year. We had that very first significant cold snap and last year was really significant, and it happened in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. Our sales spiked during those last 2 weeks. As we all know, it's been a warm fall. The beginning of winter is warm so far. What happens going forward, we don't know. They're calling for it to be a warmer winter, we'll see what happens. And I don't think, necessarily, when you think about average temperatures, is that really the driver? What we need are a few really abrupt cold snaps because the parts that are on the verge of failing will fail when those cold snaps happen, and we'll get our failure-related business back in those categories.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to ask Bill if you could just help contextualize a little bit, the benefits that you all would have seen in the spring and summer with the last 2 years from what we're sort of, I would say, unusually favorable winter conditions. Just to help us contextualize that as we head into this coming spring and summer period.\n\n---\n\nYes, clearly, we said many times over that a harsh winter does benefit us in the spring and summer. We've never been able to go in and say specifically how much it drives us. But clearly -- and it really happens with the undercar parts. So what happens with the tough and particularly a wet and snowy winter is the roads get a lot of damage, and that puts a lot of pressure on chassis systems, on brake systems and the like. And so we do tend to benefit from those as the spring thaw happens and into early parts of the summer.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And just to understand a little bit more if I could on the cost side. I was a little bit surprised to see the 15 bp hit from IMC just because I thought it would have been cycled more or less. So can you discuss a little bit the ins and outs there and how to look at that moving forward as well as the labor cost, which popped up a little bit? Is that due to increases in terms of pay per hour? What's kind of driving that? Is it hourly rates that drive service, I think, you alluded to?\n\n---\n\nYes. I would say that on the IMC front, we haven't fully anniversaried. It will just anniversary through September -- after September. But we've also opened 5 new locations, so we went from 17 to 22 locations. So those 5 locations are adding some incremental expenses as they begin to get themselves ramped up. So my expectation is that we would see a little bit of headwind from IMC for the next quarter or so as we begin to mature some of the new openings that we have had. From a payroll  perspective, it's really probably better service levels overall. I think that we've increased our payroll hours a little bit across the board. We're not seeing a significant amount of wage inflation yet. We've seen a little bit. We anticipate probably a little bit more going forward. But overall, I would say we've improved our service levels in line with our \"Yes! We've Got It.\" initiative.\n\n---\n\nThis is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. My first question is that some of your competitors called out a benefit from the M&A disruption in the space. Could you perhaps throw some color as to what you're seeing in terms of those trends and any impact that you're getting?\n\n---\n\nAnytime somebody goes through a major acquisition integration, it's a challenge. We're not going to get focused on what they're doing. We're going to focus on what we're doing. I talked about it in our prepared remarks. We've got a great strategy. What's going to matter is whether or not we are able to execute that strategy. I think we're doing that right now. We got to make sure we continue to do it. What happens with others is going to happen. There's nothing we can do to -- do about it, so we're just going to focus.\n\n---\n\nGot it. Okay. And then my next question is about ALLDATA. There were some press releases in the last quarter about some new partnerships and agreements that you got for this ALLDATA business of yours. Could you perhaps talk about these and the potential of this business going forward in general?\n\n---\n\nYes. We've got a few partnerships with a few important vendors and also with customers as well, and that's pretty much ongoing. We will continue to grow the ALLDATA business. We feel good about ALLDATA business. We think that it's a leader in the industry. And we had signed the agreement with AAMCO, you may have seen referring to just recently to provide them with service through all their locations. So it's a great product, well respected in the industry and has good prospects going forward.\n\n---\n\nThis is actually Mark Carden on today for Michael. It looks like the gross margin basis point impact from the more frequent delivery initiative picked up slightly this quarter. Can you guys talk maybe a little bit about what was slightly more costly than expected? And now what's bringing you guys up to the high end of your expected range looking forward?\n\n---\n\nYes, and that's a very good question and that's spot on. So we were 37 basis points deleverage due to supply chain, and we had articulated at 25 to 30. So it was a little bit higher. I think part of that is really just, as we continue to roll out new programs with activity, I mean, if you look at the quarter in a little bit more finite detail, we've probably rolled out about 300 programs onto the program this quarter, although we took off a couple of hundred programs that got us to that net 80. So there was a lot of activity that occurred during the quarter. And as we begin to ramp this up, our handling costs or our internal costs to deliver more frequently will rise a little bit. And then also keep in mind that this quarter and particularly next quarter as well are slightly lower volume quarters. So we really won't have the opportunity to leverage quite as much as we might during the summer months, so to speak. So I think that, overall, we feel pretty good about the estimates that we've given on an annualized basis. Although on any given quarter, they may fluctuate a little bit.\n\n---\n\nGreat, that's really helpful. I guess, as a follow-up, can you talk about the performance in the stores I've seen, that greater delivery frequencies implemented? And has it been, I guess, consistently higher across the board? Are you guys seeing some variability?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's a great question, and we do see variability. And that's the reason why we're going to go forward with the strategy that says roughly 2/3 of our stores are going to see 3x to 5x per week deliveries and 1/3, I'm going continue to see one-time a week delivery. The big variable that drives it, as you would expect, is store volume. You're talking about replenishment levels. And the more product that you sell, the more frequently you need to replenish it. And so we do see significant variability, but it's along the volume scale.\n\n---\n\nA quick question on the store level SG&A investment. I guess, if we were looking -- are we thinking about adding employees or maybe changing the mix of employees and getting sort of higher end parts pros as you grow that commercial business?\n\n---\n\nI wouldn't say it would be changing the mix necessarily. I think that as the commercial business continues to grow, we will continue to invest in the commercial sales pros as you call them in the organization. I think really the comparison this year versus last is that we increased our service levels relative to where we were last year. I think last year, we probably cut back a little bit more than we wanted to. I think, actually, we probably might have even called that out last year that we thought our service levels were not at the level that we wanted them to be. And so this year, we didn't want to make -- repeat that mistake. And so we stuck with our model during the quarter, and I think we delivered better service levels.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then a follow-up on that. The hard parts centric store prototypes and as you've reset some of the legacy stores, do you see doing more of those? Or are you sort of where you are at where you need to be from a distribution and the hard parts availability standpoint?\n\n---\n\nI think as far as resetting some of those stores we talked about, we've got a new store prototype. So all the new stores that opened will be under that prototype. We've gone back, I can't remember, I think about 126 stores. We've already remodeled on that new store prototype, and we will continue to do that. But frankly, I suspect we'll get into the hundreds of stores. I don't see that being 1,000 stores necessarily because we're going to have physical constraints as we go through the process. But where we can find opportunities to add more hard parts into space constrained stores, we're going to continue that.\n\n---\n\nIs the performance of that hard part of the new prototype store meaningfully different than the legacy mix?\n\n---\n\nIt's different enough for us to justify the investment. We can debate what meaningful is, but those stores are performing better and those hard parts are moving.\n\n---\n\nYes, not -- if I could add on to that, number one, the new prototype is not materially more expensive than the old prototype. So as we open new stores, it's -- there's no meaningful cost differential. The real benefit comes in the really, really space constrained stores that we have. Remember, we still have a lot of 3,800-square-foot stores or 5,000-square-foot stores. When those stores are performing at high volumes and we're able to go in and remodel them to the elements of this new prototype, that's where we can really see a differential.\n\n---\n\nI'm just on for Denise Chai today. So 2 quick questions. One, it looks like the comp total sales variance narrowed a bit from recent trends, and just curious if that's from the peso or something else. And then two, any commentary on new store growth for this year, if you could comment on that.\n\n---\n\nSure, great questions. First of all, on the peso, our same-store sales are domestic only. So the peso variances aren't impacting our same-store sales at all. If you look at last quarter, our same-store sales did 4.5%. They did 3.5% in Q1 of 2016. You can almost point directly to the last 2 weeks performance as to why that's different. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we went up against the polar vortex last year in those 2 weeks when we had phenomenal weeks. This year, we had good weeks, but they were up against phenomenal weeks. And that's basically the differential in our same-store sales for the quarter.\n\n---\n\nAnd just any commentary on new store growth if you could.\n\n---\n\nYes. We plan to open -- we opened 158 stores last year, I believe it was or 157. We plan to open about 150 stores this year on a domestic basis. We're looking to grow Mexico around 40 stores. And Brazil, we're kind of taking them one at a time.\n\n---\n\nThe first question I had was relative to the IMC, the import business. I think you said you had 22 locations and those were able to service about 600 stores. Can you talk about how that business has evolved? How important that is relative to the future growth and where you'd like to see that business in terms of touch points relative to your existing store base.\n\n---\n\nYes, great question. All right, so a couple of things. Number one, when we acquired IMC just over a year ago, they had 17 branches. We've now opened 5 new branches. We stand at 22 open locations. Those IMC branches are servicing 600 AutoZone stores, but that's not a function of how many branches we have. That's a function on some short-term system limitations that we have at AutoZone to be able to serve up that catalog in our AutoZone stores. We're working -- we did some short-term solutions that have allowed us to get in those 600 stores, so we can test it. Now we're having to go back and do the more robust work to industrialize those system improvements. That will be coming later in the year, which will allow us to expand how IMC services the AutoZone stores. I want to also be careful to not overstate the implications of IMC servicing AutoZone stores. Yes, we will leverage IMC, but that's not going to be the big driver of our commercial business. The reason -- the main primary reason we bought IMC is because we think IMC in of itself is a good business, and we will continue to expand that business as we've shown with the 5 stores that we've opened to date.\n\n---\n\nIs that a business that can double or triple? I mean, I'm just trying to understand, it's a great business. And the import side of the business is going to continue to grow given the car park and how that evolve.\n\n---\n\nYes. The -- if you take a look at the industry leader in the import side of the business, they get well over 100 locations. I don't see why we can't do the same over time.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And if I could have just one follow-up on sort of another business that can contribute the ALLDATA side, and I know you've talked about some wins and such. But how much of that business do you get sort of a lead into where you should be structuring your commercial side? And what parts you need to be carrying because, I guess, that's a system that's in place with your installer base and probably developing relationships before you may have some of those well-established relationships at a store level.\n\n---\n\nThere is some of that -- there is an ability for us to be able to extract some information. I think that we still have a lot of work to do relative to acquiring more information out of ALLDATA in order to improve some of the synergies across our commercial business as well. So I would categorize it as it is helpful on identifying certain trends, but we still have a long way to go in doing that.\n\n---\n\nMy question is around MegaHubs. It sounds like you're having some good success in rolling up MegaHubs and getting lifts from the stores they're servicing. Can you provide any more detail on what kind of cycle lift you're seeing specifically out of the stores from MegaHubs?\n\n---\n\nWe haven't got into the specific distinctions between inventory delivery frequency in MegaHubs. What we continue to say is if you have both of the programs, they're going to add between $1,000 and $1,500. Now that also varies because some of the MegaHubs are -- the stores that are serviced by that MegaHub are serviced by them 3 times a day directly, while other stores are serviced by other hub stores that get deliveries 3 times a day and then other hub stores get overnight delivery. So there's quite a bit of variability in it, but we continue to be pretty comfortable in saying, if you get frequency of delivery and MegaHubs, it means about $1,000 and $1,500 per store.\n\n---\n\nGot you. And in terms of your growth base at MegaHubs, you've talked to you're around 25 to 30 over the next few years, what's the limiting factor in slowing that rollout if you're having pretty good success with the ones you already have out there?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's just as simple as, number one, we wanted to go test this program, and so we got 5 up and running. We made the decision in the late summer, early September to move forward with the strategy. Now it's a function of the real estate development pipeline. And remember, I mean, even for a regular AutoZone store it can take us 2 years to get a store open. So it has nothing to do with anything other than our real estate pipeline and how long it's going to take us to do that. Trust me, we are pushing very hard on that front.\n\n---\n\nRight, that's clear. Then lastly, not to spend too much more time on the weather, but I just want to understand since the weather was unfavorable at the end of the quarter, how has your business progressed through the fiscal second quarter?\n\n---\n\nYes, everybody always wants us to talk about that, and we stay away from that. Unlike a lot of organizations that will have their conference call 4 to 6 weeks after their end of the quarter, it's only been 2 weeks and 2 days. So I think it's not a good prudent strategy for us to talk about what happened in the first couple of weeks, and we've been consistent about that for a long time. So I don't want to break that. Now I will say this, weather normalizes over time. And I also want to reiterate that really cold winter is great, but what we really look for is just a few goodhearted cold snaps. And that's when we really see big spikes in our businesses, certain failure-related categories.\n\n---\n\nThank you. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. We thank you for participating in today's call, and we'd like to wish everyone a very happy and healthy, safe holiday season and a prosperous new year. Thank you very much.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Simeon Gutman (Analysts)】\nMy question is on multiple delivery and DC rollout. I guess, DC eventually will come into this -- I missed some of the prepared remarks, but I guess an expectation of maybe sometime late this fiscal year or next. If you think about the cadence of investment, the 20 to 30 basis points or so from supply chain, how does the DC investments play into that? Does it bump it up? Does it -- will you get some benefits -- other benefits that take it down.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, a couple of great questions. First of all, we will open our distribution center in Mexico, our second DC in Mexico, hopefully, by -- this fiscal year or first of next fiscal year. The 2 DCs that we're working on, domestically, currently will not open until 2017. Hopefully, one in the first or second quarter and then the second one in the third or fourth quarter. As you know, those things take time. As those distribution centers open, clearly, they will have some capital investments. But on the operating expense front, I don't think that they will be a material contributor to drive our operating expenses up or down. As we do more frequent deliveries,  they're going to have some benefits because the stem miles of the transportation routes will be shorter, but obviously they'll have incremental operating expenses of having the new facility and new management team and all those things. I think those will net out generally.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simeon Gutman (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then one quick follow-up. Granted it's early days with the multiple delivery, but I imagine in store some of the inventory, the complexion is changing a little more depth to maybe less safety stock. Is that the case? How are stores acclimating to it? Are there any protocol in store to minimize disruption? And obviously, that should be translating into sales.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes. I would say that was one of the things that we looked at when we first started our test on this program. The store operators like it. They like it a lot. Number one, when the truck comes in, it's in bite-size pieces. So it's much more easy to work into the daily activities versus being the big event of the week where they have to have all hands on deck. So they like it. Yes, it pulls down safety stock, which one of the challenges we have when we talked about our store. The future trying to eliminate some of the -- this physical constraints that we have in our stores. One thing this does is pull down the safety stock and allows us to put more parts on the shelf. So from an operating standpoint, I think it's all systems go, and they really like it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nYou had noted that the -- obviously, the commercial revenue growth of 10% is quite good. But you did note that it decelerated from previous quarters. When you look at the results for the stores that are commercial programs that are still being delivered to once a week compared to those that are on a 3- to 5-week schedule, was there a deviation in their sales performance?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, Dan, there's clearly a deviation. But I would say, first of all, the benefits that we see from both of the inventory availability initiatives are both on the retail side and the commercial side. I wouldn't say that those stores reacted any differently in comparison than they did in Q4, if that makes sense.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nSo when you looked at the bit of moderation and revenue growth in commercial from 4Q, it was pretty much the same and whether the stores are being shipped to once a week or 3x or 5x per week.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, I think that's right. As a reminder, when we do the delivery frequency and the MegaHubs, we see about $1,000 to $1,500 per store if you get both elements of that. That differential seems to be confirmed in everything we've done so far, and we did see a moderation in our sales growth kind of across the board.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nAnd then just one other follow-up question on the incremental commercial growth. How's that splitting out between doing more business with existing customers? Or are your salespeople now engaging new customers and making them aware of your greater capabilities? But if you could talk about how the split is developing.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI think it's a combination of both. I mean, clearly, as we mentioned, we've grown our mature programs in the mid-single-digit rate. So we're getting more productivity out of our existing base programs as they continue to mature. But clearly, with our opportunities to say \"Yes! We've Got It.\" on a more frequent basis and be able to deliver products more timely both through more frequent deliveries as well as the MegaHub network and being able to communicate that to our customers with our sales force is an important thing. We have been able to do that, and I think we'll continue to gain traction over time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nAnd if I could just sneak in real quick question. Can you remind us how much -- how important are your commercial customers at Firestone and the service part of Pep Boys to AutoZone?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nWe don't talk about specifics on our commercial customers, but obviously, Firestone is one of our great customers. We appreciate their business, but I don't want to get into specifics on them. And obviously, don't do much, if any, business with Pep Boys.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Becks (Analysts)】\nIt's actually Mark Becks on for Chris. Historically, the DIY category has been sort of a flat to 1% comp industry and you guys are obviously doing much better than that. What if anything has changed on the DIY side outside of the fuel price declines? And what do you think the rate of the growth in the industry is currently?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes. I think, clearly, we are seeing some industry strength currently. I think a part of that has to do with what's going on with gas prices. And while gas prices initially went down, you didn't see the initial correlation with miles driven increasing. But in more recent months starting really strong in the summer and continuing through September, the latest data we have available, it's showing nice strength. Over long periods of time, we've seen that has a nice correlation with our DIY industry growth. But I also say that our performance, I don't think it's solely based on industry. We talked about it in the prepared remarks. We're also gaining market share and I think a lot of these initiatives that we have in place, particularly around inventory availability, are beginning to pay dividends. And remember, we're just very early in the early innings.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Becks (Analysts)】\nAnd 2 quick follow-ups to that. Who do you think you're taking share from, whether it be on the independent or the national retailers? And then also, just with the lower gas prices, have you seen any particular lift that you might be able to quantify? Or if you've done any historical correlation? So, for instance, a 1% increase in miles driven would add 25 basis points to comps.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, I don't think the analysis that we have is that finite. What I would say is we would think that we're getting the benefit of 1% to 2% at this point in time in our DIY business. As for who we're gaining market share from, I don't really want to get into that. I'm more focused on are we gaining market share and what we're going to do to gain more of it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Becks (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then just last question. You spoke to still being optimistic about growing sales and then talked about a dip in trends the last 2 quarters. Can you speak to any variability by region that you saw over the last couple of weeks? I think it was 50 here in the Northeast this past weekend and it's supposed to be 60 again this weekend.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, thank you. Great question. Number one, we wanted to call out what happened in the last 2 weeks of the quarter because it was materially different. It wasn't materially different this year from the other weeks in the quarter. What was materially different was last year. We had that very first significant cold snap and last year was really significant, and it happened in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. Our sales spiked during those last 2 weeks. As we all know, it's been a warm fall. The beginning of winter is warm so far. What happens going forward, we don't know. They're calling for it to be a warmer winter, we'll see what happens. And I don't think, necessarily, when you think about average temperatures, is that really the driver? What we need are a few really abrupt cold snaps because the parts that are on the verge of failing will fail when those cold snaps happen, and we'll get our failure-related business back in those categories.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Montani (Analysts)】\nI wanted to ask Bill if you could just help contextualize a little bit, the benefits that you all would have seen in the spring and summer with the last 2 years from what we're sort of, I would say, unusually favorable winter conditions. Just to help us contextualize that as we head into this coming spring and summer period.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, clearly, we said many times over that a harsh winter does benefit us in the spring and summer. We've never been able to go in and say specifically how much it drives us. But clearly -- and it really happens with the undercar parts. So what happens with the tough and particularly a wet and snowy winter is the roads get a lot of damage, and that puts a lot of pressure on chassis systems, on brake systems and the like. And so we do tend to benefit from those as the spring thaw happens and into early parts of the summer.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Montani (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And just to understand a little bit more if I could on the cost side. I was a little bit surprised to see the 15 bp hit from IMC just because I thought it would have been cycled more or less. So can you discuss a little bit the ins and outs there and how to look at that moving forward as well as the labor cost, which popped up a little bit? Is that due to increases in terms of pay per hour? What's kind of driving that? Is it hourly rates that drive service, I think, you alluded to?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nYes. I would say that on the IMC front, we haven't fully anniversaried. It will just anniversary through September -- after September. But we've also opened 5 new locations, so we went from 17 to 22 locations. So those 5 locations are adding some incremental expenses as they begin to get themselves ramped up. So my expectation is that we would see a little bit of headwind from IMC for the next quarter or so as we begin to mature some of the new openings that we have had. From a payroll  perspective, it's really probably better service levels overall. I think that we've increased our payroll hours a little bit across the board. We're not seeing a significant amount of wage inflation yet. We've seen a little bit. We anticipate probably a little bit more going forward. But overall, I would say we've improved our service levels in line with our \"Yes! We've Got It.\" initiative.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chandni Luthra (Analysts)】\nThis is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. My first question is that some of your competitors called out a benefit from the M&A disruption in the space. Could you perhaps throw some color as to what you're seeing in terms of those trends and any impact that you're getting?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nAnytime somebody goes through a major acquisition integration, it's a challenge. We're not going to get focused on what they're doing. We're going to focus on what we're doing. I talked about it in our prepared remarks. We've got a great strategy. What's going to matter is whether or not we are able to execute that strategy. I think we're doing that right now. We got to make sure we continue to do it. What happens with others is going to happen. There's nothing we can do to -- do about it, so we're just going to focus.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chandni Luthra (Analysts)】\nGot it. Okay. And then my next question is about ALLDATA. There were some press releases in the last quarter about some new partnerships and agreements that you got for this ALLDATA business of yours. Could you perhaps talk about these and the potential of this business going forward in general?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nYes. We've got a few partnerships with a few important vendors and also with customers as well, and that's pretty much ongoing. We will continue to grow the ALLDATA business. We feel good about ALLDATA business. We think that it's a leader in the industry. And we had signed the agreement with AAMCO, you may have seen referring to just recently to provide them with service through all their locations. So it's a great product, well respected in the industry and has good prospects going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Carden (Analysts)】\nThis is actually Mark Carden on today for Michael. It looks like the gross margin basis point impact from the more frequent delivery initiative picked up slightly this quarter. Can you guys talk maybe a little bit about what was slightly more costly than expected? And now what's bringing you guys up to the high end of your expected range looking forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nYes, and that's a very good question and that's spot on. So we were 37 basis points deleverage due to supply chain, and we had articulated at 25 to 30. So it was a little bit higher. I think part of that is really just, as we continue to roll out new programs with activity, I mean, if you look at the quarter in a little bit more finite detail, we've probably rolled out about 300 programs onto the program this quarter, although we took off a couple of hundred programs that got us to that net 80. So there was a lot of activity that occurred during the quarter. And as we begin to ramp this up, our handling costs or our internal costs to deliver more frequently will rise a little bit. And then also keep in mind that this quarter and particularly next quarter as well are slightly lower volume quarters. So we really won't have the opportunity to leverage quite as much as we might during the summer months, so to speak. So I think that, overall, we feel pretty good about the estimates that we've given on an annualized basis. Although on any given quarter, they may fluctuate a little bit.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Carden (Analysts)】\nGreat, that's really helpful. I guess, as a follow-up, can you talk about the performance in the stores I've seen, that greater delivery frequencies implemented? And has it been, I guess, consistently higher across the board? Are you guys seeing some variability?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, it's a great question, and we do see variability. And that's the reason why we're going to go forward with the strategy that says roughly 2/3 of our stores are going to see 3x to 5x per week deliveries and 1/3, I'm going continue to see one-time a week delivery. The big variable that drives it, as you would expect, is store volume. You're talking about replenishment levels. And the more product that you sell, the more frequently you need to replenish it. And so we do see significant variability, but it's along the volume scale.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bret Jordan (Analysts)】\nA quick question on the store level SG&A investment. I guess, if we were looking -- are we thinking about adding employees or maybe changing the mix of employees and getting sort of higher end parts pros as you grow that commercial business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI wouldn't say it would be changing the mix necessarily. I think that as the commercial business continues to grow, we will continue to invest in the commercial sales pros as you call them in the organization. I think really the comparison this year versus last is that we increased our service levels relative to where we were last year. I think last year, we probably cut back a little bit more than we wanted to. I think, actually, we probably might have even called that out last year that we thought our service levels were not at the level that we wanted them to be. And so this year, we didn't want to make -- repeat that mistake. And so we stuck with our model during the quarter, and I think we delivered better service levels.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bret Jordan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then a follow-up on that. The hard parts centric store prototypes and as you've reset some of the legacy stores, do you see doing more of those? Or are you sort of where you are at where you need to be from a distribution and the hard parts availability standpoint?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI think as far as resetting some of those stores we talked about, we've got a new store prototype. So all the new stores that opened will be under that prototype. We've gone back, I can't remember, I think about 126 stores. We've already remodeled on that new store prototype, and we will continue to do that. But frankly, I suspect we'll get into the hundreds of stores. I don't see that being 1,000 stores necessarily because we're going to have physical constraints as we go through the process. But where we can find opportunities to add more hard parts into space constrained stores, we're going to continue that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bret Jordan (Analysts)】\nIs the performance of that hard part of the new prototype store meaningfully different than the legacy mix?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nIt's different enough for us to justify the investment. We can debate what meaningful is, but those stores are performing better and those hard parts are moving.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, not -- if I could add on to that, number one, the new prototype is not materially more expensive than the old prototype. So as we open new stores, it's -- there's no meaningful cost differential. The real benefit comes in the really, really space constrained stores that we have. Remember, we still have a lot of 3,800-square-foot stores or 5,000-square-foot stores. When those stores are performing at high volumes and we're able to go in and remodel them to the elements of this new prototype, that's where we can really see a differential.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Curtis Nagle (Analysts)】\nI'm just on for Denise Chai today. So 2 quick questions. One, it looks like the comp total sales variance narrowed a bit from recent trends, and just curious if that's from the peso or something else. And then two, any commentary on new store growth for this year, if you could comment on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nSure, great questions. First of all, on the peso, our same-store sales are domestic only. So the peso variances aren't impacting our same-store sales at all. If you look at last quarter, our same-store sales did 4.5%. They did 3.5% in Q1 of 2016. You can almost point directly to the last 2 weeks performance as to why that's different. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we went up against the polar vortex last year in those 2 weeks when we had phenomenal weeks. This year, we had good weeks, but they were up against phenomenal weeks. And that's basically the differential in our same-store sales for the quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Curtis Nagle (Analysts)】\nAnd just any commentary on new store growth if you could.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes. We plan to open -- we opened 158 stores last year, I believe it was or 157. We plan to open about 150 stores this year on a domestic basis. We're looking to grow Mexico around 40 stores. And Brazil, we're kind of taking them one at a time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anthony Cristello (Analysts)】\nThe first question I had was relative to the IMC, the import business. I think you said you had 22 locations and those were able to service about 600 stores. Can you talk about how that business has evolved? How important that is relative to the future growth and where you'd like to see that business in terms of touch points relative to your existing store base.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, great question. All right, so a couple of things. Number one, when we acquired IMC just over a year ago, they had 17 branches. We've now opened 5 new branches. We stand at 22 open locations. Those IMC branches are servicing 600 AutoZone stores, but that's not a function of how many branches we have. That's a function on some short-term system limitations that we have at AutoZone to be able to serve up that catalog in our AutoZone stores. We're working -- we did some short-term solutions that have allowed us to get in those 600 stores, so we can test it. Now we're having to go back and do the more robust work to industrialize those system improvements. That will be coming later in the year, which will allow us to expand how IMC services the AutoZone stores. I want to also be careful to not overstate the implications of IMC servicing AutoZone stores. Yes, we will leverage IMC, but that's not going to be the big driver of our commercial business. The reason -- the main primary reason we bought IMC is because we think IMC in of itself is a good business, and we will continue to expand that business as we've shown with the 5 stores that we've opened to date.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anthony Cristello (Analysts)】\nIs that a business that can double or triple? I mean, I'm just trying to understand, it's a great business. And the import side of the business is going to continue to grow given the car park and how that evolve.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes. The -- if you take a look at the industry leader in the import side of the business, they get well over 100 locations. I don't see why we can't do the same over time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anthony Cristello (Analysts)】\nOkay. And if I could have just one follow-up on sort of another business that can contribute the ALLDATA side, and I know you've talked about some wins and such. But how much of that business do you get sort of a lead into where you should be structuring your commercial side? And what parts you need to be carrying because, I guess, that's a system that's in place with your installer base and probably developing relationships before you may have some of those well-established relationships at a store level.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nThere is some of that -- there is an ability for us to be able to extract some information. I think that we still have a lot of work to do relative to acquiring more information out of ALLDATA in order to improve some of the synergies across our commercial business as well. So I would categorize it as it is helpful on identifying certain trends, but we still have a long way to go in doing that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Basham (Analysts)】\nMy question is around MegaHubs. It sounds like you're having some good success in rolling up MegaHubs and getting lifts from the stores they're servicing. Can you provide any more detail on what kind of cycle lift you're seeing specifically out of the stores from MegaHubs?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nWe haven't got into the specific distinctions between inventory delivery frequency in MegaHubs. What we continue to say is if you have both of the programs, they're going to add between $1,000 and $1,500. Now that also varies because some of the MegaHubs are -- the stores that are serviced by that MegaHub are serviced by them 3 times a day directly, while other stores are serviced by other hub stores that get deliveries 3 times a day and then other hub stores get overnight delivery. So there's quite a bit of variability in it, but we continue to be pretty comfortable in saying, if you get frequency of delivery and MegaHubs, it means about $1,000 and $1,500 per store.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Basham (Analysts)】\nGot you. And in terms of your growth base at MegaHubs, you've talked to you're around 25 to 30 over the next few years, what's the limiting factor in slowing that rollout if you're having pretty good success with the ones you already have out there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, it's just as simple as, number one, we wanted to go test this program, and so we got 5 up and running. We made the decision in the late summer, early September to move forward with the strategy. Now it's a function of the real estate development pipeline. And remember, I mean, even for a regular AutoZone store it can take us 2 years to get a store open. So it has nothing to do with anything other than our real estate pipeline and how long it's going to take us to do that. Trust me, we are pushing very hard on that front.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Basham (Analysts)】\nRight, that's clear. Then lastly, not to spend too much more time on the weather, but I just want to understand since the weather was unfavorable at the end of the quarter, how has your business progressed through the fiscal second quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, everybody always wants us to talk about that, and we stay away from that. Unlike a lot of organizations that will have their conference call 4 to 6 weeks after their end of the quarter, it's only been 2 weeks and 2 days. So I think it's not a good prudent strategy for us to talk about what happened in the first couple of weeks, and we've been consistent about that for a long time. So I don't want to break that. Now I will say this, weather normalizes over time. And I also want to reiterate that really cold winter is great, but what we really look for is just a few goodhearted cold snaps. And that's when we really see big spikes in our businesses, certain failure-related categories.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nThank you. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. We thank you for participating in today's call, and we'd like to wish everyone a very happy and healthy, safe holiday season and a prosperous new year. Thank you very much.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning. I'm Colby Brown, Vice President of Investor Relations. And on behalf of the H&R Block management team, it's my pleasure to welcome you here in attendance and those participating via the webcast to H&R Block's December 2015 Investor Conference.\r\nWe have an informative and exciting morning plan for you, and are glad that you're able to join us.\r\nBefore we get started, we have a few housekeeping items to take care of. Yesterday, we released our fiscal 2016 second quarter results. That release as well as today's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures and the schedules attached to the press release, and you can find those, both the release and the schedules, on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.hrblock.com.\r\nI'd also like to remind everyone that today's presentation and various comments made in connection with it will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As such, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2015 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.\r\nShortly after this morning's presentations conclude, we'll post the slides on our Investor Relations website. As a reminder, our webcast will also be available for replay on the website.\r\nTo give you a sense of today's agenda, opening presentations will run until approximately 10:00 Eastern and then we'll take a 15-minute break. Refreshments will be available throughout the morning and on a quick logistical note, restrooms are out the door and to your right, just past the registration table.\r\nWe then expect to begin Q&A around 11:15 Eastern. So again, welcome everyone. Thank you for being here today, and we hope you enjoy the presentations.\r\nI'd now like to introduce our President and CEO, Bill Cobb.\n\n---\n\nGood morning, everybody, and welcome to this year's investor conference. We're pleased to have you join us.\r\nToday, we're going to share with you a look back at this company's transformation, the opportunities we see going forward and how we will continue driving value for shareholders. And we have a great lineup of speakers this morning. So let me begin with those introductions.\r\nFirst up, Kathy Pickering, our Vice President of Regulatory Affairs and the Executive Director of the H&R Block Tax Institute. Kathy is going to talk about the impact of tax fraud and the lack of standards on this industry and how H&R Block is leading the industry in partnering with the IRS and others to address these problems.\r\nNext on the agenda, Laura Scobie, our Vice President of Client Insights. Laura will talk about the dynamics of the tax season, our seasonal promotions and the launch of a new brand to better serve clients with more sophisticated tax situations.\r\nThen Jason Houseworth. Jason leads our Tax Product Strategy and Development group and is going to discuss trends in the DIY industry and how we're positioning ourselves for continued success in that category.\r\nThen, as Colby said, we'll take a 15-minute break and when we return, Mark Ciaramitaro, our Vice President of Taxes and Health Care Services. Mark will discuss the Affordable Care Act, what we learned in 2015 and how we see that impacting our business in the industry in 2016 and beyond. And finally, Greg Macfarlane, our Chief Financial Officer. Greg will talk about our second year and year-to-date results, review all the recent changes and activities and then pull it all together with a detailed financial view of why H&R Block is a good investment.\r\nBut before we get to them, I want to spend a few minutes addressing 3 topics that will help provide context for the remainder of the morning. The first is a look back at H&R Block's transformation over the last few years. Then I'll address some key issues affecting the tax-preparation industry. And then I'll close with the company we are today and why we look to the future with great optimism.\r\nSo to fully understand the transformation of H&R Block to the company we have today, we have to first understand from where we came. And as many of you know, the period of 2007 to 2011 was an extremely difficult one for this company. To be blunt, the company was in turmoil. Business results were lagging, and we were attempting to be a financial supermarket through diverse business lines that were taking the company away from its core tax business.\r\nIn short, H&R Block was unsure of what it wanted to be and who its clients were. All of these factors combined to create leadership challenges. There was an activist involved, the company had a revolving door of CEOs, 4 of them from 2007 through April 2011. I joined the Board in August 2010, and so I'm often asked why I took the CEO job. Well, it's because I knew this was a great company with great products and, as I've come to learn, great people. So I was pleased to say yes when the Board asked me to step into the CEO role beginning in May 2011.\r\nStarting out, I knew the company needed focus, focus on our core tax business, and focus on sustainably growing the top line and improving margins. So we went about executing -- exiting noncore businesses. We had already stopped originating and servicing mortgages through option 1. So our next step was to sell RSM McGladrey, an accounting and consultancy business.\r\nWe also divested a smaller underperforming business, Express Tax, and a tax software company, RedGear. But this company needed to grow revenue. So we not only focused on the fundamentals, we innovated as well. We created and implemented a new strategy in fiscal 2013, Tax Plus, which has grown to 5 products that have added value for our clients before, during and after the tax season. And it's important to note, we're the only company with a suite of products like this, a key point of ongoing differentiation.\r\nTogether, over the period of fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2015, our Tax Plus strategy has generated accumulative product revenue of over $1.2 billion with overall growth of 11% over 3 years.\r\nThe company's transformation was made possible by a stable leadership team that has executed on our strategy over the last 4 years, and we expect this team to continue.\r\nIn June of this year, the Board extended my tenure through September 2018, so I plan to be here as CEO for the foreseeable future.\r\nAnd the members of my senior leadership team have multiple tax seasons under their belts with proven results.\r\nIn August of this year, we completed the final step in our transformation back to a focused tax company when we finalized the divestiture of our bank. Now I have to admit, the bank was starting to feel like my life's work, but we did get it done. And with this final step, we are much better suited to bring even more value to you, our shareholders, through an appropriate new capital structure and the freedom to make capital structure decisions without regulatory oversight.\r\nH&R Block has a long history of returning capital to shareholders. For example, in January, we will pay our 213th consecutive quarterly dividend, that's over 53 years and counting.\r\nAnd during my tenure, we've increased the dividend by 33%. Continuing on this tradition of returning capital to shareholders, in September, we outlined a strategy to put an appropriate capital structure in place for our business going forward. Our Board approved a $3.5 billion share repurchase program effective through June 2019. And as part of this, we executed a $1.5 billion tender offer in October, purchasing over 40 million shares at $37 per share.\r\nWe also replaced and upsized our existing line of credit to $2 billion and issued $1 billion of new long-term debt.\r\nIncluding the tender offer, all of this translates to total repurchases of over 76 million shares since I started in May 2011. That's about 25% of our outstanding shares at an average share price of $26.38.\r\nI'm proud of these accomplishments, but I'm even more proud of the fact that we did what we said we would do. So as you can see, these changes have resulted in a fundamentally different company, one transformed from the unfocused financial supermarket of 2007 to the company of today, one focused entirely on tax preparation and related products.\r\nSo what has this transformation meant for our business results? Company revenues have grown for 3 straight years after a multiyear revenue decline. Profitability has dramatically increased with EBITDA increasing $136 million and EBITDA margins improving 5 points since fiscal 2012 to approximately 31%.\r\nIn digital, our revenue growth has outpaced the industry over the last 4 years as more and more consumers become aware of our DIY products. Our international operations generated revenues of $239 million in fiscal 2015. Our established businesses in Canada and Australia saw a significant growth in local currency revenue, and we have the beginnings of solid businesses in new markets.\r\nAnd we've invested back into the business where it's made sense. We've enhanced our retail stores inside and out, strengthened our systems and technology infrastructure, designed and implemented new tax-preparation software and as part of our growth strategy, we bought franchise and independent locations at compelling returns. And the total impact of our actions and performance is that the market has responded very favorably. Our stock has outperformed with S&P 500 by greater than 50% for the last 5 years.\r\nSo with that look back at our performance, I'd like to shift to the present. Based on how we've executed on our strategic vision, it should be crystal clear how committed H&R Block is to continuing to lead the industry we invented over 60 years ago. As the leader, it's important that we take a view on important new issues impacting the industry. While I will briefly comment on some of these issues, the presenters following me will go a bit deeper on each.\r\nThe first issue is tax fraud. For many of you here, you know this is the third investor conference in a row in which I've been talking about the need to address fraud in a holistic way through a public-private partnership.\r\nInterestingly, a competitor, who has been talking about its industry leadership on this matter, began doing so only after it ran into a major problem in the middle of the last tax season. And that problem was SIRF or Stolen Identity Refund Fraud, which reached new and especially alarming levels this past tax season. But this problem is not new. As I discussed at last year's investor conference, from 2010 to the 2013 filing season, the most recent years for which stats are available, there've been over 2.9 million victims of tax identity theft.\r\nAnd as we saw in the last filing season, the problem became so extensive that it now threatens taxpayer confidence in the system.\r\nAnd as a result, earlier this year, the IRS convened that public-private partnership, which includes H&R Block, other members of the industry and state tax authorities to develop solutions that will better protect taxpayers who use DIY methods.\r\nI'm encouraged by the progress made so far and Kathy Pickering will talk to you about that progress and what still needs to be done. But it's important to remember that stolen identity refund fraud is just one part of the overall problem of tax fraud. There are others such as fraud or improper payments associated with the earned income tax credit. Simply put, DIY filers don't have to answer the same EITC eligibility questions as those who get help with their taxes. And the result is a high level of fraud or improper payments. It's our belief that the slight migration we're seeing from assisted to digital is primarily due to fraud, committed by EITC filers and identity thieves. Were it not for fraud, we believe this slight migration wouldn't have occurred. In fact, excluding fraud, the percentage of filers getting assistance may have actually grown. Kathy Pickering will go deeper on this issue in the next presentation.\r\nThe final point I'll cover on fraud is the lack of minimum standards for return preparers. In short, this lack of minimum standards is enabling fraud, perpetuated by unscrupulous tax preparers. Now you've heard me say it before, all 50 states have minimum standards for barbers and hairdressers, yet only 4 states have minimum standards for those who perform one of the most important financial transactions of the year for millions of taxpayers. That makes no sense. We need prudent commonsense measures that include mandatory testing, continuing education and background checks for all return preparers. The outcome of this problem is still to be determined, but we are seeing encouraging movement in legislative circles to address it. \r\nH&R Block has been the clear industry leader in fighting tax fraud, and you won't have any trouble finding where we stand or what we've said about all of these important issues. And we'll continue to lead and make our point of view abundantly clear to policymakers and administrators, and you'll hear some of that later this morning.\r\nNow you may be wondering why does H&R Block keep talking about fraud. It's actually very simple. The measures we advocate for will level the playing field across the industry, reduce fraud and better protect consumers. It's as simple as that.\r\nNow the next issue I'll discuss is complexity and the potential for tax code reform. It's been a topic of the current political campaign, just like it's been a topic of campaigns over the last several decades. The fact is complexity in the tax code is a result of the government administering public policy programs through the tax code, like the EITC or buying a home or saving for retirement. These are very important programs and impact virtually every American. And complexity certainly impacts our business, too. Remember, we have to thoroughly understand and follow the law. And so we have to train over 80,000 tax professionals every year to ensure they're ready to serve our clients.\r\nAn example is the increased training cost we incurred last year to prepare for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. In fact, last season was the first time many Americans navigated the intersection between their health insurance and taxes. The ACA directly affected over 3 million of our clients. In this coming season, the ACA will impact even more as the number of people in the exchanges steadily grows. We've said all along that the opportunity presented by the ACA will take several years to fully unfold. But I remain very confident that H&R Block is particularly well positioned to serve our clients going forward. Mark Ciaramitaro will give you our update later this morning.\r\nAnd regardless of whether progress to simplify the tax code actually happens, we know there are basic enduring truths to which tax filers subscribe. They want to pay only the taxes they owe. They want the maximum refund to which they are entitled. They want their tax return to be accurate. And they want to minimize the stress and hassle of filing their taxes.\r\nToday, in total, the U.S. tax code and supporting documents are over 74,000 pages long. But in 1955, when we first started, the tax code was much simpler. Still, clients came to us in droves, so much so that Henry and Richard Bloch were able to invent this industry. And so we believe by any logical conclusion, as history has clearly shown, people want help with filing their taxes. But as you know, we are the largest tax preparer serving the entire landscape of filers. Whether clients want help from our highly trained, skilled tax professionals or to do it themselves using our best-in-class software, it doesn't matter. We serve clients however they want to be served.\r\nSo to this point, you've heard me describe the company's transformation, our new capital structure and how we have led the industry during some tough challenges. And while we're proud of our accomplishments, we understand what matters most is the future, and we couldn't be more excited about the future, for both this industry and for H&R Block. The tax preparation industry is steady, and in many people's minds, not very exciting. But I can tell you that nothing can be further from the truth. Whether it's the challenge of implementing complex new tax laws like the ACA, tackling big issues affecting millions of Americans like fraud, or navigating the ever-changing landscape of the assisted DIY categories, there is much work to be done. And when you are committed to doing the right thing as H&R Block is, these challenges ultimately translate into opportunities. And so the tax-preparation industry isn't just necessary, it's still an industry with opportunity.\r\nFor decades, people have needed and wanted help in preparing and filing their taxes. 135 million individual tax returns are filed during the tax season and counting. And no one is better able to help these tax filers than H&R Block, the clear industry leader.\r\nVirtually everyone knows our brand. With our 10,000 retail offices, we have unmatched scale. Our 80,000 tax pros are the best in the industry. And our innovation from our DIY offerings to our Tax Plus products, to our progress in global markets, these are just a few examples of how this company is leveraging the power of its brand to grow.\r\nThis growth opportunity is uniquely combined with a stability not often found in other sectors. We generate over $3 billion of revenues on an annual basis and our profitability is growing.\r\nOur return on invested capital is nearing the top decile of the S&P 500, and our record of returning capital to shareholders is proven.\r\nSo even though we're in a steady slow-growing industry, H&R Block has room to run. As you'll hear a little later, we're bringing new ideas to the table in our assisted business to better align our services with the dynamics of the tax season to meet the challenge of growing early-season clients and to serve our clients who have more sophisticated tax situations.\r\nIn digital, we continue to grow revenue and awareness of our great DIY products.\r\nOur international business continues to be fast-growing with exciting opportunities in India and our Expat services. And our innovative Tax Plus products continue to meet a growing need for more and more of our clients.\r\nSo in conclusion, I've covered a lot of ground this morning. And from my comments, I think you can understand why we're excited to be in this industry, why we will continue leading it, and why we think H&R Block is a great investment. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nHello, I'm Kathy Pickering. I've been with H&R Block for over 17 years and I've held a number of different roles during that time. \r\nToday, in my current role as Vice President of Regulatory Affairs and Executive Director of the Tax Institute at H&R Block, we're talking about the impact of fraud and the lack of standards on the tax industry. You've heard the term fraud thrown around a lot, but I'm going to talk about 3 very different types of tax refund fraud: Improper payments on the Earned Income Tax Credit or EITC, return preparer standards and Stolen Identity Refund Fraud or SIRF.\r\nOn the surface, these types of fraud seem quite different, but there are 2 common themes: A lack of consistent minimum standards and the anonymity of the DIY product, which opens the door for tax refund fraud.\r\nBut why should you care about these issues? Well, as you will see later, we believe that fraud is distorting industry and competitor results, and the solutions that are being implemented for next tax season and beyond will help level the playing field and Block will benefit because of this. But you should also care because the amount of fraud and the dollars represented are staggering. Of all the EITC payments, 22% to 26% a year are improper payments or between $14 billion and $17 billion. Of all the federal benefit programs, including Medicare and Social Security, the percent of EITC improper payments is, by far, the worst.\r\nFor comparison, Medicare has an 8.5% improper payment rate and Social Security, it's less than 1%.\r\nOn return preparer standards, H&R Block has unique insight on competency across the industry. Over the last few years, our acquisitions team has screened thousands of independent tax firms who are interested in becoming H&R Block franchisees.\r\nThese potential acquisitions need to meet certain minimum criteria such as number of returns, professional appearance and adequate computer systems before we'll seriously take a look at them. One step in our evaluation process is to review the actual tax returns in order to assess the level of quality. The results are shocking. We are finding that nearly 1 in every 2 prospects has some form of noncompliance and 1 in 4 is committing fraud, such as falsely inflating refunds to attract new clients. And this is what we're finding from the firms that have been prescreened or qualified, so supposedly, we've weeded out the worst firms before we spend a lot of time on them.\r\nTurning to Stolen Identity Refund Fraud, this problem is growing worse. Starting in 2010, there were roughly 400,000 incidents and it has grown to some 2.9 million incidents through 2013, the last year for which we have data.\r\nWhy is this problem growing worse? Because like this New Yorker magazine cartoon of years ago shows, the Internet allows anonymity. Simply put, current gaps in authentication allow criminal online filers to easily mask their identity. And remember, there've been no minimum standards in place. And the problem of Stolen Identity Refund Fraud is reaching a tipping point, meaning, it must be addressed effectively or else it puts the entire tax administration process at risk. H&R Block is leading the way forward for this industry and when this problem is effectively addressed, not only will government, industry and consumers benefit, but H&R Block may benefit as well because we've led the way on developing solutions and it will tip the balance back to a level playing field.\r\nWith all that as a backdrop, now let's go a little deeper into each of these 3 fraud areas.\r\nLet's start with EITC. EITC is an antipoverty program for low income working families. The maximum credit for next year will be about $6200, that's a lot of money, especially for a low income family.\r\nFor most, it's the largest single financial payment of the year and for working families, it can be a lifeline. They use that money to cover bills, often late bills or pay for car repairs, rent and just catching up.\r\nThe rules for EITC eligibility may seem fairly simple, the children must live with the taxpayer for at least 6 months and the taxpayer has to have earned income, but it's never that simple. Especially in complex family structures such as blended or multigenerational families. So proving who cared for the children and where they lived can be difficult. The government doesn't call it EITC fraud, but rather, improper payments. Because it's a mixture of things, payments made to the right household, but the wrong person, lack of documentation or actual fraud. And given the sensitivity around this program, there's no publicly available data that shows how treasury classifies the improper payments between unintentional mistakes and actual fraud.\r\nWe know that about 22% to 26% of EITC payments were improper in taxes in '15 and that amounts to $14 billion to $17 billion last year.\r\nAnd there is a history here of billions in fraud and improper payments each year, it's absolutely mind-boggling. That's why we're so passionate about driving change in this area. We need to implement practical measures to reduce the fraud, and in doing so, protect the EITC program for those it was meant to benefit.\r\nI want to spend just a minute on the relationship between filing status, income, number of children, and how that impacts getting the maximum EITC credit. If you look at this chart, the X axis is for income and the Y axis is for the EITC credit amount. For example, in 2014, if you were a single head of household with 3 children, and you wanted to get the maximum credit of $6143, you would see that you needed to have income between $13,650 and $17,850. If your income was more than that or less, you would not get the maximum EITC amount.\r\nFor a fraudster, filing an online tax return, it's quite similar to using the solve 4 function in the spreadsheet. And many EITC returns managed to file exactly within that income range. Coincidentally, these returns may also have a Schedule C, which is the form for self-employment, small business profit or loss, which enables the fraudster to either increase income or reduce it with expenses to stay right within that sweet spot, without any additional documentation.\r\nAs we've discussed in previous investor conferences since the increased due diligence was required when an EITC taxpayer chose to use a paid preparer, the EITC filings are migrating from paid preparer to DIY methods and the fraud problem is migrating with them.\r\nIn 2008, it was roughly 70% assisted and 30% DIY. \r\nIn 2015, it has migrated to 55% assisted and 45% DIY. And during that same period of time, assisted returns, excluding EITC returns, actually grew at the same rate as the industry. This really doesn't make sense. EITC returns can be complicated and many families want help preparing that return. Thus, the shift to DIY is difficult to explain other than for the growth in fraud.\r\nThere are several reasons that DIY makes fraud easier. The increasing availability of online technology enables an anonymous transaction and doesn't require the signature of a third-party preparer. Access to online tax prep software facilitates that solve 4 function to maximize the claim. It's much less risky to do a what-if analysis online versus sitting in front of a preparer, and saying, \"Well, what if I claim another child? What will that get me?\" And with online methods, you don't have to provide any documentation or answer intrusive questions.\r\nIn contrast, paid preparers are required to document additional, and sometimes, embarrassing information to verify the EITC claim. If they don't, the preparer can be penalized $500 per return even if the tax return itself is correct and the taxpayer isn't being audited.\r\nSo to avoid those penalties, some independent preparers become ghost preparers, which means they use DIY software to prepare the return and don't even sign it, often the taxpayer doesn't even know.\r\nSo to the IRS, it looks like a self-prepared return and, of course, with an aggressive DIY competitive offer for free federal and free state e-filing, fraudsters don't even need to have a credit card to pay the fees, which means they can dodge another point of verification.\r\nBut there is some good news. Government and industry are making progress. For the upcoming 26 filings -- 2016 filing season, H&R Block, along with 3 other software companies, is part of a DIY pilot test run by the Treasury Department. This pilot will measure the impact of additional questions on DIY filers claiming the EITC.\r\nAnd IRS has retrained their due diligence auditors so that they will no longer be required to ask paid preparers to ask certain invasive questions. And there's more to come for 2017. The IRS is expected to have consistent EITC eligibility requirements regardless of filing channel, plus the IRS has asked Congress for additional legislation, such as the ability to reduce the refund amount of EITC for claims that can't be substantiated.\r\nSo will this stop EITC fraud? In the short term, no. But in conjunction with return preparer standards, all the SIRF fraud fighting initiatives and other legislation we hope and believe that this will reduce EITC fraud and improper payments. It will get fixed. It's simply a question of when.\r\nSo now, let's shift gears for a quick update on minimum standards for return preparers. Currently, there are no federal minimum standards in the industry. The IRS's attempt to implement the return preparer program was overruled by the courts in 2014 despite stating in their opinion that they thought the program was needed. Congress needs to give the IRS this authority, and it just hasn't gotten done yet. In response to the IRS's inability to regulate at the federal level, the states are implementing their own state return preparer programs. California and Oregon have had programs in place for a number of years and Maryland and New York have recently implemented programs. And we're aware that there are a few other states like Illinois that are also looking at their own programs, and we support that because there are no federal standards today.\r\nLooking at the case of Oregon, it provides compelling evidence that establishing return preparer standards makes good sense.\r\nIn a study done by the Government accountability office, they reported that paid preparers in Oregon were more likely to file an accurate tax return as compared to the rest of the country. And for Oregon's 1.6 million individual tax filers, this equated to over $390 million more paid in federal income taxes, more than if they had been prepared by preparers in the rest of the country.\r\nRight now, to be a paid tax preparer, all the IRS is able to require is a PTIN or a Prepare Tax Identification Number, and in order to get a PTIN, all you need is a name, Social Security number, date of birth and pay a $50 fee and answer a couple of questions.\r\nH&R Block has much higher standards. We've been in the business for 60 years, and we understand what it takes to competently and ethically prepare and submit a federal or state tax return. We set high standards for all 80,000 of our tax preparers. H&R Block requires each one to stay current on the tax law and comply with the rules through 60 hours of basic income tax training, a competency exam and 18 hours of continuing education every year.\r\nWe also conduct background checks and have an internal compliance and ethics oversight program. Clearly, for taxpayers who choose to get assistance, competency and ethics should be table stakes.\r\nFinally, I'd like to spend some time drilling down on Stolen Identity Refund Fraud. To commit SIRF, all a fraudster needs to create a false tax return is name, Social Security number and date of birth, that's it. And with DIY software, it's an anonymous transaction. There's no identity or other validation required. The fraudster simply creates a fraudulent return, e-files it and typically funnels the stolen money to an account. For anyone who does online banking, you're accustomed to having to validate your identity, but not so for tax filing. There are no minimum requirements for the tax industry to do any validation. The nature and scale of refund fraud is changing. We have this example of an individual posting on Facebook that she was the queen of IRS tax fraud and taunting the authorities. Well, she was arrested and sentenced to 21 years in prison.\r\nOver the last few years, the fraudsters have evolved. There are now international and domestic organized crime rings with sophisticated IT capabilities. They have a good understanding of the tax code, especially the holes in the tax administration systems. They have computer programmers who write scripts to submit returns in large volume. And based on what gets rejected versus accepted, they can methodically reverse engineer the IRS and state fraud filters.\r\nThere have also been large-scale data breaches ranging from Target and Home Depot, to Anthem and the office of personnel management. Stolen data is widely available for sale on the dark web where criminals can buy it in volume. And with computer scripts that they write, they are able to submit hundreds, thousands, possibly millions of fraudulent returns through online methods. Even if only a small percentage makes it through and pays out, it means a huge payday for the fraudsters. This kind of fraud is almost a perfect crime. The probability of getting caught is relatively low, but the payoff is very high.\r\nThere are other reasons why SIRF has grown. There has been a rise in the availability of anonymous accounts, such as unauthenticated debit cards to make it faster and easier to negotiate the stolen funds. And as we've discussed, millions of personal identities are available for exploitation.\r\nAnd social media provides a platform for the fraudsters to share their best practices, real-time learnings about what's working and what's not. \r\nAs you know, H&R Block has been an industry leader for years and that leadership includes the security protocols we've had in place. For example, we required and accepted federal return before filing a state return. We have a team of dedicated fraud analysts, and we authenticated identity for our prepaid Emerald Card and many other things that we're not going into. \r\nClearly, to protect consumers against this growing threat, government and industry needed a cohesive and unified way forward. So Bill Cobb called on Commissioner Koskinen to bring the industry together in a public-private partnership to fight fraud. Commissioner Koskinen's background and experience as the Y2K czar uniquely positioned him to know how to bring together such different organizations as the tax industry, the IRS and the states. And all of us have differing agendas, levels of technology sophistication, capability, and budgets. But everyone can agree that we have a common enemy, fraudsters, and a common goal, fighting fraud with a unified defense for 2016 and beyond. All of the industry has to implement a consistent set of standards; ensuring a level playing field is critical, or else the fraudsters will simply go after the weakest links. \r\nSo how are government and industry leveling the playing field? Remember, one of the key reasons that SIRF has increased is because the DIY online filing process is virtually anonymous. In part because the IRS and the states can't always see the tax filer behaviors such as what device was used, which IP address the return was sent from. So a number of measures are being implemented at the federal, state and industry levels for the upcoming tax season. Under authentication, there are a number of tools being put in place to help verify the identity of online filers and implement strong security protocols. Examples of these measures include requiring stronger passwords and asking security questions if something is different or appears suspicious. \r\nFor H&R Block, we already had most of these standards in place. So for us, our work is about refinement. For some of our competitors, this is a whole new way of doing business. Another component that is critical for detecting and fighting fraud is appropriate information sharing so government and the industry are addressing that too for the coming tax season. Tax-preparation companies with more than 2,000 returns will be required to conduct fraud monitoring and analysis, and share their findings or report leads to the IRS in a timely manner. It will be done through a secure infrastructure and process that will respect taxpayer rights and protect personal identifying information. Again, not a heavy lift for us as we've had the fraud program in place for over 3 years. \r\nFor a government industry effort that is as interconnected as this, these are really important commonsense steps. These changes will be in effect in January, just a month from now. \r\nLooking to the future, there will be additional changes in 2017 and beyond. In the areas of security technology, centralized information sharing and financial products, H&R Block is well positioned for these changes. We believe our relationships with the IRS and the states are on solid ground, which better protects our programs and products. \r\nSimply put, our competitors have to catch up with us. For the assisted independent competitors, many without an IT fraud or compliance staff, the risks become that much greater. For the smaller DIY competitors, many have not had centralized fraud detection and compliance capabilities. Now they have to scramble to create this. \r\nThe potential consequences are great. We've seen states refuse to accept e-filing from companies who have unacceptable levels of potentially fraudulent submissions. Again, H&R Block is well-positioned. The work to defeat the fraudsters is a good start, but more work needs to be done. This is a holistic problem, and it can only be solved by all of us working on it together, the IRS, our competitors, and the states. More work needs to be done in standards, technology, investment, and legislation. None of the steps taken individually solve the problem, but all of these steps combined in tandem with the IRS, the states, and industry will make a positive difference. It's the right thing to do for taxpayers, and it's the right thing to do for the tax industry. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nGood morning. I'm Laura Scobie, and I lead the client insight team here at H&R Block. I'm going to talk to you today about 3 things that focus on growing our assisted tax business. \r\nFirst, I'll review our strategic foundation for growth, and that is consumer segmentation. Because the customer is the driving force behind all major business decisions, you will see it woven throughout other topics in today's discussion. \r\nStarting with our plan for achieving growth in the assisted business early in the tax season, and moving into a new brand launch that focuses on an important consumer segment that until now was only partially addressed with our current model. \r\nStarting with segmentation. Just a quick overview for you. We have decades of experience understanding tax filers and their needs. We constantly refine and deepen this knowledge base. This deep knowledge of the tax filing universe, some 135 million filers in the tax season, shows us exactly what they want from tax-preparation. This customer knowledge is a sustainable advantage for H&R Block. We're able to group people with similar tax needs into distinct segments. \r\nThis isn't data for data's sake. Our understanding of the tax marketplace is deeper and better than anyone else in the category, and we're leveraging that knowledge in every decision we make. Today, we're talking about segments in terms of 3 broad groups. This is just to illustrate a point. It's actually much more complex than we'll discuss today. \r\nThere are defining attributes that surround each segment, and I could go into great detail, but I summarized it into the key things I want you to know about each segment. \r\nFirst, for people in Segment A, these clients have needs that are all about the money. For these tax filers, the refund is likely their biggest payday of the year and they want to maximize their refund each and every year. \r\nNext, Segment B is a high-touch tax segment that needs year-round service. They value assistance, but believe their tax situation is too complex for just any tax preparer to handle. So they're willing to pay for more expertise. Our research shows that 65% of tax filers fall into segments A and B. This number has remained fairly constant over time. \r\nFinally, tax filers in Segment C believe they're capable of preparing their own return, so they want a DIY method. Jason Houseworth will talk more about our DIY business later today. \r\nWith the detailed understanding of how each of these segments wants to be served, we have a way forward for how to win all types of new clients based on what they want and need. \r\nTo fuel new client growth in our assisted tax business, I'd like you to meet Diane, who represents Segment A. She works 60 hours a week as a waitress, is a single mother of 2 and receives the earned income tax credit because she is 1 of the 33 million whose economic situation allows her to qualify for this program. When it comes to tax prep, Diane wants all the deductions she's entitled to, and she wants to know her tax preparer did everything possible to help her. \r\nThe need for the refund is so great that most of Segment A file as quickly as they can. When we looked at Segment A's return count over our 4-month tax season, January and February saw the highest volume of Segment A returns, with a spike at the end of the season. January and February are what we refer to as the early-season. The sooner they come in, the sooner they get their refund, which to many like Diane is her annual bonus. \r\nI'd like to put this in context of our total tax season '15 results. Last year, we saw that our client loss came solely from the early-season. We saw steady growth during the late season, which was encouraging. Our analysis of the early-season showed that 1/3 of the client loss was driven by our decision to eliminate the free easy program. But more importantly, the other 2/3 of the client loss was made up of EITC clients. Looking deeper, we found this isn't unique to H&R Block's assisted tax business. EITC clients were down across the assisted tax prep industry in total. But it was particularly concerning to us for a couple of reasons. EITC clients are highly valuable and they're a group that historically H&R Block has done well with. We're a brand that is well-known and respected by EITC clients, we have products that benefit them, and we are skilled at handling the complexity that comes from EITC forms. H&R Block does meet several needs of the EITC client. To start to win them back, we had to craft an early-season program that appealed to their hearts and their minds. To do this, we leveraged what we learned from talking to hundreds of clients firsthand, sitting in their homes, having coffee with them, which I was doing in this photo taken just last Friday, talking very openly about their lives. And the bottom line is we know what really matters to these folks. We know what it takes to win them back. And winning them back starts now. On January 9, you will see, hear and feel a powerful early-season program from H&R Block that will make a positive difference in the lives of our clients. It will stand out in the marketplace, it will be impactful. \r\nFor competitive reasons, I'm not sharing this initiative with you today, but I can assure you that come tax-season, you'll be very aware of it. But \r\nI can tell you about the targeted marketing we used to reach these tax filers. Through our segmentation, we know, for clients and non-clients alike, who switchers might be. These are people who are most likely to consider H&R Block, and even those who may think about leaving us. We can then go directly to them with enticing offers that matter to each of them. Our customer relationship management is a capability we've invested in over the past 2 years. It allows us to expose specific groups to targeted products and messages that meet their needs. And of course, we can speak to them in their preferred language. \r\nWe also use W-2s to target customers with offers. We can purchase W-2s based on industry of employment and tailor our messages accordingly. This is just the first step in a targeted multi-year multidimensional plan to win back EITC clients. We know this client loss happened over a number of years, not just last tax season. And we know it will take an investment of time and resources to get them back. We created a plan that will force consideration or reconsideration of H&R Block. It starts with targeted marketing and includes an improved client experience that speaks to Segment A, as well as taking a stance through government relations in a way that benefits these consumers. \r\nLet me say a little about each of these other items. Starting with the client experience. We continue to enhance our experience to make sure that we're delivering the right environment for this early-season client. We're hiring more tax pros, improving their training and enhancing their skills. We'll have more bilingual associates to help Spanish-speaking clients maneuver through the system. It means continuing to leverage technology to personalize the experience. The tax interview will be customized to the client sitting across the desk. This client experience gets them through the process and out the door with the maximum refund. For government relations, which Kathy Pickering spoke to, this is about standing up for our clients and protecting them where they need our help. As Kathy explained, the 3 areas of interest are: return preparer minimum standards; EITC fraud and improper payments; and Stolen Identity Refund Fraud. These are the 3 pillars of our multi-year, multidimensional plan to win back EITC clients. We're excited about this comprehensive plan. \r\nSo that's Segment A. Now let's shift to an equally exciting growth area, and that's with Segment B. Segment B has a different and more complex set of tax needs. This client is looking for an added level of expertise when it comes to taxes because they believe their tax situation is complicated and they're probably right. They're looking for a tax professional that's available year-round to answer questions and meet with them if they need it. They expect to work the same preparer every year because they want their tax professional to get to know their personal situation. \r\nWe have a portion of our offices that currently meets the needs of Segment B. That is H&R Block Premium. Premium started in 1982, and we currently have around 300 offices across the country. Premium tax professionals are experts at navigating a wide variety of complex situations. They're capable of doing anyone's taxes. In fact, these tax professionals have delivered for Segment B clients year after year. Historically, the premium business lacked focus. But with our tax professionals' capabilities, our current footprint, and the underserved Segment B audience, we decided to give it more attention and more closely align it with the needs of Segment B. \r\nWith Premium as our starting point, we created a new brand and business model that's more intensely focused on serving Segment B. Happy and excited to introduce to you today, Block Advisors, an ideal tax solution for the millions of Segment B clients that have real help -- or need real help with their complicated tax needs. Because this is a different consumer, we will meet their needs in different ways. Block Advisors gives clients a private office and a more intimate experience. The offices are more sophisticated, more CPA like, but still approachable. Block Advisors will address your complex tax needs, as well as provide tax planning and year-round tax advice. \r\nAnd in many cases, these Segment B clients have other needs as well. For example, about 1 in 5 of them are small business owners. Block Advisors will offer them payroll, bookkeeping, business tax services, and of course, we will be there to handle their personal taxes as well. \r\nWhat a perfect opportunity to deliver on a real need. So what we have are 2 businesses, 2 types of clients and 2 avenues for growth. \r\nTo recap, H&R Block has served us well for 60 years and will do so for another 60. Within that business model, tax is an annual financial event. It's about well-trained tax professionals who work hard to get their clients every dollar they deserve, and it's largely about the refund. Block Advisors meets the needs of a different consumer segment. These clients have year-round tax needs, they're more complex and have needs that may extend into planning and small business services. And importantly, tax is one part of their financial plan. Different consumers, different needs, different value propositions. Block Advisors will launch with 287 offices nationally. Most of these are converted H&R Block Premium offices. The cost associated with this fits within our ordinary capital expense plans, which Greg will outline later. We expect to grow the Block Advisors brand over the next few years, building a larger footprint as we establish this value proposition. \r\nI told you a lot about Block Advisors and the clients they will serve, but now I'd like to show you a video that really brings this new brand launch to life.\r\n[Presentation]\n\n---\n\nThe Block Advisors website is now live, so we encourage you to go to the website for more information at blockadvisors.com. \r\nIn closing, we're excited about our plan for growth. It's based on understanding and meeting client needs across all segments. H&R Block now has 2 distinct brands and each is positioned to serve different types of clients. These brands can literally sit side-by-side, and prosper and grow because they have 2 distinct value propositions. This focus allows us to build solutions that differentiate rather than just trying to meet the basic needs for all. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nGood morning. I'm Jason Houseworth, and as the President of Product Strategy and Development, my role is to create great experiences for all of our tax clients. \r\nAnd today, I plan to share what we believe is a winning formula for DIY clients and discuss how this formula is designed to succeed going forward within the digital category, given 2 key trends shaping this dynamic category: the material presence of fraud, and the convergence of value and premium. \r\nBut I'm going to start by outlining our winning formula in this competitive environment with the goal year in and year out to outpace the category in overall e-file growth, and grow profitably as we do it. \r\nAs Laura just mentioned, at the highest level, we categorize tax filers into 3 general groupings. We look at these groupings aligned with the 60-40 split of assisted and DIY users and believe strongly our DIY products should be designed for the roughly 40% of tax filers who choose to do it themselves. These users have specific needs that they're looking to be fulfilled or validated within the tax offer experience. They're confident in their ability to perform tax-preparation. And, in contrast to the assisted user, they want to control the process. They love the flexibility and convenience of preparing taxes on their own schedule. And finally, they expect a trade-off, that is to say, to be rewarded for the investment of their time with a lower price. \r\nThis is the do-it-yourself client, and these are the requirements that form the basis of our maniacal approach to build the best tax software in the digital category. You should recognize our formula for this client from last year's investor conference. It has 3 components: product innovation or delivery to the consumer of intelligence as a service; a multiscreen focus to design first for the native device, whether it's desktop, smartphone or tablet; and a brand that has awareness and can support the full set of integrated tax services that consumers expect. \r\nOur focus, first and foremost, has been consistent product innovation. The result of which has been a dramatic set of changes that have completely redesigned the product since 2011, both on the surface and behind-the-scenes. \r\nIn tax season 2011, our product was primarily on focus on conversion or the rate at which registered users become completed or filed returns within our tax interview. And this data-driven approach led us to recognize the key areas of opportunity within the product, but also led us to what was then a small but exponentially growing number of mobile users. \r\nWhile we were able to optimize this flow from a conversion perspective, we recognized the opportunity to design first for the mobile user, really as a chance to start over, to rebuild the product from the ground up, beginning with this version in 2013. This was Version 1 of a product designed to be optimal on every screen size. But the focus of the redesign wasn't just on conversion and the need to design the interview for a mobile screen, it was also to enhance the user's perception of value, especially for more complex tax users. How can software deliver on this to the DIY user? By embedding logic to help anticipate what the user needs, like how our interview can begin by taking a picture of your W-2 to automatically pull name and address information as opposed to asking you to manually enter it on your phone. Our ability to import tax form data, including the 1095 -- 1095A import feature to auto populate your health coverage details, the way we proactively recognize things that you may have otherwise forgotten to take advantage of, through a feature that we call Pro Tips, and giving you the desired confidence you expect by demystifying things that don't make sense, like through our Refund Reveal. Refund Reveal is a unique trademark feature released in our product for all users in tax season 2015, and it exemplifies how we deliver on the central expectation of the DIY user to understand how the software calculates the refund. In a way that enhances value perception. \r\nThis feature is unique in the digital category, and it differentiates H&R Block tax software and our expertise to the DIY user. All of these features that I've mentioned are now live in this year's product, and collectively, they represent, what I call version or year 3 of our redesign. \r\nAnother example of our consistent focus on product innovation is how we've iterated on MyBlock. MyBlock, for those of you who haven't already created your account, is the virtual account available for all H&R Block tax clients, DIY and assisted, to maintain a year-round relationship with our brand. It also represents how the product innovation we've developed in our tax software area is adding value for assisted clients. Launched in tax season 2013, MyBlock has been used by over 8 million clients, more than half of which are assisted clients leveraging this tool to do things like review their tax history with H&R Block to access prior year returns and other supporting documents and to visualize the personal history that exist inside their tax data that's securely held by H&R Block. Product innovation has propelled advancements for both the DIY and assisted H&R Block clients. But for the DIY business, the most important thing is how this translates to results. \r\nSince Bill took over as CEO 4 years ago and empowered us to pursue this winning formula, we've seen the 7% tax return or e-file growth and the 9% revenue growth as validation of our innovation and testing process. I'm especially pleased in the quality of our growth over this time period with a new 1040 or complex clients growing the fastest. We also know that we must be mobile-first in our design thinking so that we create a responsive, multiscreen product. That is to say, our products must seem to the mobile or tablet user as if the product was designed specifically for that device. Our focus in this area to design with a multiscreen mentality for all 6,000 of our federal and state product pages has improved our waterfall for all clients over the past 4 years. But it is been most dramatic for mobile users, as we've improved conversion by more than 30 points as a result of this effort. This helps us more efficiently convert the clients that our marketing efforts help add to the top of the funnel. And speaking of marketing, we know that the whether DIY users are value or premium consumers, they will demand that their software be built by a great and trusted brand. \r\nOver the past 4 years, we've seen awareness that H&R Block makes tax software grow 16 points, from 51% to 67%, 67% is a number that both dwarves value competitors, because it has taken significant investment to achieve, but it also has a lot of headroom and therefore continues to represent the largest opportunity to challenge the category leader. \r\nSo that's our winning formula, a formula that created unit and revenue share gains in tax season 2015, and one that we see as a winning formula going forward with one update. We will continue to ensure we are the industry leader when it comes to proactively preventing fraud and providing a secure platform from which to file. This has long been a consistent and continual focus for H&R Block, but a fight that we have waged alone, until this past tax season. Thanks to the leadership of Kathy Pickering and others within H&R Block, we're pleased to see others in the industry adopt many of these standards that we've had in place for years, which leads me to the first of 2 trends shaping the digital category, fraud. \r\nMany of you have asked me how do I see fraud or to quantify the amount of fraud in the digital industry. So I thought I would share a few anomalies within the IRS' own data that point to the material effect of fraud and on the filing patterns and how this fraud is distorting competitor e-file growth. \r\nSo let's begin with Florida federal e-files and some very concerning fluctuations over the past few years. Typically, we say that return growth should match nonfarm employment or conversely, unemployment. And the gray bars that you see, they represent unemployment rate for tax seasons '12, '13 and '14, rather steady. In Florida, the unemployment data varied slightly, but it generally follow the national unemployment averages. Now let's see how closely IRS e-file and Florida e-file data matched up. It's interesting to see that Florida did not file -- follow the national trends in e-filing. Importantly, Florida has no state income tax requirement so it's a good barometer to use to evaluate federal tax filings. We would normally expect e-file rates to follow IRS filing data given it matched almost exactly with unemployment data. However, it not only varied in tax season 2013, it varied dramatically, given historical filing fluctuations typically fall within a low range. \r\nWhat explains this? Is it because Florida return filing patterns changed unexpectedly? Or because possibly, that fraud that was being generated from Florida shifted to originate from other states? Our view is that as federal fraud filters shifted to scrutinize returns originating from Florida addresses, that the fraud moved to originate from other states, something easily accomplished via online filings. \r\nThis is why the change the category leader made to allow its customers to file their state return absolutely free without the requirement of an approved federal return seemed more in line like a quest for volume rather than \"consistently leading the fight against potential refund fraud, \" which was a statement that served as a headline at their recent investor conference. \r\nDuring an interview in the middle of last tax season, their Chief Information Security Officer admitted that this unlinked state return practice had created 3 to 37 fold increases in state-only returns, returns that the company was convinced were fraudulent. The change to correct this was made in early February, a month after the launch of Absolute Zero, and past the first peak of the filing season. \r\nNow let's discuss IRS or federal e-file rejects. And for some context, a federal e-file reject can be rejected by the IRS for a whole host of reasons, and I would say many of these are valid, like when a DIY user fat fingers their Social Security number, and it doesn't much the IRS database. These e-files get rejected and then they're returned to the user to correct. However, if we assume that these mistakes are common across DIY users, then it would mean that generally we would expect the rate of rejects to be consistent across all software providers. But what I'm going to show you is that it is not. \r\nAnd so the question you should be asking yourself is, why would it be different? Now I want to show you a chart that demonstrates federal e-file rates -- pardon me, federal e-file reject rates or the percentage of filings that were rejected by the IRS by provider over the last 3 tax seasons, and I'm going to start by showing our own reject rate, which has been the industry's lowest reject rate for the past 3 tax seasons and one that has continued to come down as we've improved our backend fraud monitoring, and security controls. \r\nSo next, you see the category leader. They are the first example of how a higher reject rate can correspond to higher e-file growth. In tax season 2014, their e-file growth of 9% came with a 5-point or nearly 30% increase in rejected returns. This by the way, was their largest e-file growth that they've had since 2011. \r\nHere the reject rates of another major online competitor, which has continued to grow overtime. But if you want more evidence regarding how the reject rate corresponds with e-file growth, here's an online competitor who saw strong 8% e-file growth in tax season 2013. But when their reject rate was cut in half, their e-file growth halted. Interestingly, another online competitor saw their own reject rates spike the next year, which corresponded with an increase in their e-file growth. In fact, it almost doubled in size. My argument is that fraud exists within the system, and it can likely be seen as it moves around the system. We continue to partner with the IRS in order to push for industry standards in order to prevent this. \r\nAnd just one last note before I leave this page. I've included the reject rate of H&R Block's assisted business on the right. Our rate that is lower than all DIY competitors, half of retail competitor Liberty Tax, and one that has only marginally changed over time. \r\nLet's continue discussing trend shaping the digital category by picking up on a topic that I covered last year during our Investor Day. \r\nDuring that presentation, I previewed the season, noting that we should continue to expect a convergence of value and premium within DIY users. Specifically, I outlined how small value competitors created through the Free File Alliance or FFA will lose their ability to compete on price alone. Our view is that even value DIY-ers expect more than what I call, pen and paper on a webpage, given that prize is no longer a differentiator. I also noted how premium DIY-ers, the most complex and valuable clients, are seeing the category leader raise price on their software to level the playing field with these value competitors. I argued then, and continue to believe now, that H&R Block is well-positioned to take advantage of both of these shifts. Our online offering puts the expertise in Tax Services of the most trusted tax advisors together with innovative, easy to use tax software that is built to lead for what's next in the evolution of the DIY category. \r\nSo let's review what actually happened in tax season 2015. First, the category leader opened the season by offering its online product free for both federal and state filing. This software both tightened the federal forms for free users, and it relaxed the state price, making it $0 for 1040EZ and 1040A filers. \r\nAt H&R Block, we offered the value DIY-er a free federal filing, coupled with a promotional offer for $9.99 state filing. And despite the existence of a $0 state price, $9.99 was still the best value in DIY for 1040 filers who were eligible for our free federal online product but squeezed in the tightening by the category leader. \r\nIn contrast, the category leader raised price for complex users. Generally speaking, many of these users were asked to pay $40 more to use filing systems, whether it's online or software, or desktop software. \r\nLet me give you an example. So the tightening of the form's coverage within their online products meant that the user of last year's free federal edition, particularly the most common 1040 user who needs the Schedule A to file basic itemization, was forced to pay $40 more to file federal and state for effectively the same return year-over-year. We held price consistent for complex users. \r\nWhat happened? Well, the result was that the category leader gained volume of simple filers meaning 1040EZ filers. We gained ground with high-value desktop, and 1040 online clients. \r\nIn desktop, we gained an unprecedented 3 points of share in a single tax season, demonstrating the impact the simple filer pricing has on previously loyal, high-value DIY clients. \r\nAnd when the final tally came from the IRS, we learned that we outpaced them in total e-file growth. And given each year, we strive for profitable growth at a rate faster than the digital category; we were very pleased with the 12% revenue growth that we saw. We see this growth as sustainable growth compared to growth via price, whether it was to fund low-quality volume by the category leader or to mask a lack of growth. \r\nTo summarize, we believe our formula in DIY is winning. Product innovation delivered seamlessly to all devices while continually growing in awareness. A formula based on sustainable, profitable growth, and given the category dynamics, one we believe will continue to win in tax season 2016 and beyond. \r\nSo we will now take a 15-minute break and come back at 10:05.\r\n[Break]\n\n---\n\nOkay, everyone, thank you so much for taking your seats. And now, I'd like to introduce Mark Ciaramitaro, our Vice President of taxes and health care.\n\n---\n\nGood morning. As Colby said, I'm Mark Ciaramitaro, Vice President of taxes and health care services at H&R Block. And as Bill indicated earlier, I'm back again to provide an update on the Affordable Care Act, both in terms of what happened this past tax season and what's to come.\r\nThe Affordable Care Act, along with introducing new health plan regulations, insurance marketplaces and coverage mandates, effectively created a new and dynamic intersection between taxes and health insurance. This intersection exists because many of the ACA's key provisions are administered via the federal tax code.\r\nYou'll soon see that we expect the breadth and depth of the intersection will continue to grow as new mandates, new notice types, higher penalties and increased IRS enforcement begin to phase in. You'll also hear that we believe H&R Block is best positioned to take advantage of the opportunities tied to the growing impact of ACA on tax filers.\r\nWe can't talk about the impacts of the Affordable Care Act without understanding its long-term goal, which, simply put, was to expand health insurance coverage among a large pool of historically uninsured households. And by doing so, reduce overall health care costs. ACA sought to accomplish this by driving higher quality, improved affordability and greater access. To achieve these ends, ACA regulations created a number of new mechanisms, including the individual and employer mandates, new federal and state-based insurance marketplaces and expanded Medicaid.\r\nSo with this ACA context, as an investor, you may reasonably ask, \"So why should I care and what does it have to do with H&R Block?\" Well first, it's important to understand that because of this new intersection, ACA has brought significantly more complexity and confusion to the annual tax filing process. We believe that these newly embedded tax impacts will create opportunities for the tax industry in terms of client growth, retention and incremental revenue. We also believe, based upon our industry-leading investments and assets, that H&R Block is best positioned to capitalize in the consumer needs emerging from the tax code changes introduced by ACA. That being said, we're still in the early stages of the ACA's impact, as 2015 was really the first year many the law's tax provisions took effect. As we move into 2016 and beyond, the opportunity for H&R Block will continue to evolve.\r\nThis morning's session will be broken down into 3 primary sections. First, we're going to talk about what actually happened this past filing season, starting at the category level and then moving into specific H&R Block results. Next, we will share the ACA headlines for 2016, focusing on changes typical tax filers will experience. And finally, we will close with a short discussion around future implications and expectations for H&R Block.\r\nLet's begin by reviewing the major outcomes from the 2015 tax season. While there's ongoing political controversy regarding many of the ACA's provisions, virtually everyone acknowledges that its implementation has led to a significant reduction in the percent of uninsured households in America. Gallup, one of the most widely referenced surveys, has closely tracked a material 2-year decline since the fourth quarter of 2013 from 18% to just under 12% in 2015, which has resulted in over 17 million people gaining insurance coverage.\r\nUninsured levels are expected to continue to decline, albeit at a reduced rate, and will likely achieve historic lows in 2016. But beyond the higher coverage levels, one of the most tangible impacts of the Affordable Care Act was the new notices and forms required in the tax-filing process. Those that enrolled via state or federal marketplace received a new tax information document, the 1095-A, which included critical information needed to reconcile their premium tax credits. Importantly, households that received advance payments of the premium tax credit reported on the 1095-A, must file a tax return even if their income is below that usual filing threshold.\r\nThe tax form used to calculate the reconciliation of premium tax credits is the 8962. In frank terms, this is a complicated form, requiring multiple steps to complete it. And you'll see coming up that many households made the mistake of not including this form when they filed last year or they didn't file at all. Now households who did not have insurance coverage for all or a part of 2014 and who did not qualify for an exemption, confronted a new worksheet that calculated their shared responsibility payment.\r\nFilers made mistakes on these forms as well. In fact according to the IRS, about 300,000 filers paid a penalty when they shouldn't have, another 75,000 made basic math errors. Now thankfully, ACA allows eligible, non-covered households to receive an exemption from the penalty, but they needed to include a penalty exemption form, 8965, in order to claim it. Altogether, 2015 ACA filers experienced added complexity to a tax filing process that was already daunting for many.\r\nSo how many filers were directly impacted by ACA in 2015? Well, according to the IRS, about 25 million returns either included an ACA-related tax form or needed to. Beyond the 3 million that reconciled their premium tax credits, the 8 million that paid a penalty and the 12 million that filed for an exemption, about 2 million households did not properly file or didn't know they needed to file at all.\r\nNow historically, the relative percentage of assisted versus DIY tax returns has been in the range of 60-40. But among reconciliation and penalty ACA-impacted returns, filers tended to use assisted channels at that same or higher rate; while filers who submitted an exemption form tended more towards using DIY solutions. This is an interesting outcome that may or may not tie to other fraud trends we are seeing in the category. It's too early to determine yet if filers are making different channel choice decisions based on their newly discovered complexity, but we're going to be keeping a close eye on those trends. \r\nBeyond having to file new tax forms, perhaps the most significant impact faced by ACA filers was on their refund. Despite all of the media focus this past tax season, many tax filers were caught off-guard. This is a pretty emotional topic because for many households, the tax refund is the single biggest financial transaction of the year that they count on to cover critical household expenses.\r\nThe first major refund impact concerned the shared responsibility payment. In 2015, about 7.5 million filers had to pay $1.5 billion in shared responsibility payments, with an average penalty of over $200, which, according to our figures, resulted in an average refund decline of 7% to 10%. Over half of penalty payers had annual incomes below $30,000, which correlates closely with their lower employment and insurance coverage levels.\r\nBut penalties were not the only source of refund impacts, premium tax credit reconciliation had an especially large and unexpected impact on refunds, primarily due to filers underestimating their household income when they enrolled in a marketplace plan. In 2015, the IRS issued almost $10 billion in premium tax credits, with an average household credit of almost $3,000. However, of the 3 million filers who received these credits and reconciled, just over half had to pay back a portion of that credit. Our results indicated that these clients experienced a very significant impact, amounting to over a 30% or a $730 decrease in their tax refund.\r\nOne of the signs of added tax complexity is the degree to which filers make mistakes. Based on IRS data, over 2 million households made tax filing mistakes related to ACA. Beyond math errors, probably the most worrisome trend was connected to reconciliation, as about 40% of the households that enrolled via the marketplaces in 2013 and early 2014 simply got their reconciliation requirement wrong. They either didn't file or extend with an 8962, or they didn't know they needed to file at all. The reality is, because of the added complexity, ACA-impacted households that did not get qualified assistance have a much higher likelihood of making mistakes, and those mistakes can have important ramifications even beyond the tax return, such as losing future access to premium tax credit assistance.\r\nSo after talking about ACA trends in the overall tax category, let's hone in on some specific H&R Block results from this past tax season. Let's start with one of the most important investments we made going into 2015, which is insuring our network of tax professionals with the most thoroughly equipped and trained ACA tax experts in the industry. As we shared last year, our ACA certification training was compressive, averaging 7 dedicated hours of tax theory, software practice and extensive case study work. We also deployed additional tools and support resources to assist tax professionals in handling especially complicated ACA scenarios.\r\nIn terms of 2015 tax results, we ended up investing over 600,000 hours of ACA-specific training across 80,000 tax professionals staffed in 10,000 offices. And clients who received their refund benefits of our ACA expertise gave our tax professionals higher Net Promoter Scores. We believe this strategic investment in our people will continue to pay dividends because it has ensured our tax professionals competency in handling the full range of ACA tax situations that their clients are likely to face, both now and in the future.\r\nIn terms of describing what a typical ACA impact to client looks like, based upon our year-end results, they tend to file earlier in the tax season; are substantially more likely to be lower income; tend toward being a single or head of household filer, with a higher relative mix of Latino clients; have a higher probability of being a new retail client versus do-it-yourself; tend to file either an EZ or 1040A-based tax form, including clients applying for an earned income tax credit; and finally, in terms of geography, have a higher propensity to reside in states that make up a large percentage of the historically uninsured population, such as California, Texas and Florida.\r\nAccording to the IRS, in 2015, about 16.6% of filers were directly impacted by ACA tax forms. The mix of ACA impacts, as you can see, was primarily driven by exemptions in penalty forms. H&R Block's overall percent and mix of ACA forms was similar to the tax category. That being said, we did see that the proportion of our new retail clients impacted by ACA was materially higher than those who used our DIY products.\r\nIn terms of the shared responsibility payment, H&R Block clients paid a slightly lower dollar amount than the category average, this is likely due to differences in our client's average household size and income, which in turn impacts the average penalty amount. But we expect these amounts to increase in the future as higher penalty rates go into effect.\r\nAll told, after the first full year of implementation of the Affordable Care Act, we gained some important insights. First, while a significant number of overall tax filers were impacted by ACA, the impact was heavily concentrated on lower-income segments, who typically file earlier in the tax season and tend to use assisted channel solutions. Next, the added form complexities led to tax-filing issues. We have said all along that one of the major outcomes of ACA is higher complexity levels and corresponding client confusion, and the numbers bear this out.\r\nWhile the total proportion of H&R Block clients whose returns were directly impacted by ACA was similar to the overall tax category, our retail clients sought assistance at a higher rate, which isn't surprising, as our historical experience is that higher tax complexity tends to drive demand for face-to-face professional expertise.\r\nAnd lastly, despite all of the ACA media attention and focus, many tax filers were surprised by the impact on their tax refund, which, in some cases, was very significant. In fact, this refund impact actually altered client-filing behavior as, on average, ACA households went in to file 7 to 10 days later than they had in prior years.\r\nSo after taking a look back, now let let's look forward and talk about the surprising number of changes filers will face as we go into the 2016 tax season. Let's start by talking about important changes in coverage verification notices. As with last year, households who enrolled in a marketplace plan will receive a 1095-A notice in order to reconcile their premium tax credits. We consider this to be a must-have tax document because it's needed to complete the reconciliation process. \r\nBut probably the biggest change in 2016, for most covered households, will be the emergence of a new tax notice, the 1095-B or C. Unlike the 1095-A, the essential purpose of the 1095-B or C is to provide qualified insurance verification with respect to the individual mandate coverage requirement. Because of the added volume, virtually overnight, these insurance coverage notices will become the most common tax-related document households receive, and we expect it there will be lots of questions about them.\r\nThe good news, for preparers like H&R Block, is that the -- in the vast majority of cases, specific inputs from the 1095-B or C will not be required when a client actually files their tax return, provided all the household members are covered. At this point you might be asking, \"Well, okay, but what's going to happen when a filing household doesn't accurately indicate their coverage status, well I have news for you, IRS enforcement is coming. With the advent of 1095-B and C data matching, the IRS now has the ability to cross-reference tax filer's coverage claims.\r\nSimply put, if a filing household indicates coverage, but the IRS has no matched record, the IRS has the ability to send out notices requesting verification of the claim. If no verification is provided, ACA penalties will be applied to the filer's tax account. Additionally, as with last year, the IRS gets monthly data feeds from HHS for households who enrolled in a marketplace plan. This means that the IRS has the real-time ability to hold refunds for those who do not properly file and reconcile using Form 8962.\r\nNow, the IRS typically uses automated mailed notices to inform taxpayers regarding filing inconsistencies and issues, and the same is going to be true for ACA-related notices. In fact, the IRS has provided over a dozen notices that they intend to send out to address the full range of potential ACA-related inconsistencies, all the way from simple math errors to tax collection and refund offset protocols, and we expect millions to be sent later in 2016. Filers will soon learn that the error of tax leniency with respect to ACA is coming to an end.\r\nMoving on to penalty changes. Last tax season, ACA penalties were the higher of $95 per adult or 1% of household income, which as a result translated into an average penalty amount of about $200. This coming tax year, penalties for noncoverage will increase to the higher of $325 per adult or 2% of household income, which practically means that the average household without coverage could face a $400 to $500 hit to their tax refund.\r\nThe implication of this penalty increase will play out in 2 key areas: enrollment and exemptions. As penalty rates increase, the expectation is that households will have higher and higher incentives to get qualified coverage, but the open question is whether the impact of these higher-tax penalties is enough to overcome premium and out-of-pocket affordability issues many households face. But the other really important implication is that the relative value of tax expertise tied to determining a household's eligibility for exemptions will also increase.\r\nNow last year, H&R Block clients who secured an exemption saved an average of about $120. In 2016, we expect the effective value of finding penalty exemptions for eligible clients to exceed the entire cost of an average tax return. Let me repeat that, the dollar value of a found ACA exemption alone will be more than what our filers will pay for a typical assisted tax refund, and these penalties are going to continue to escalate. \r\nFor tax year 2016, non-covered filers will face the higher of 2.5% or almost $700 per adult. Now we are talking about really painful consequences. We expect there to be more reconciliation clients impacted in 2016 as well. As we stated, marketplace-enrolled clients who received premium tax credits must file using Form 8962, and this complexity impact will be experienced by both prior 2014 year enrollees and a whole new group of 2015 marketplace customers. \r\nIn terms of volume, according to the IRS, about 4.5 million filers will be required to reconcile last tax season. We expect that number to approximately double in 2016, because double the number of people enrolled this past year. But you may ask, \"What's the longer-term forecast for marketplace enrollment.\" Well, the general answer is, marketplace enrollment growth will continue, but the rate of that growth is uncertain.\r\nRecall 7 million initially enrolled in 2014, and that number climbed to over 11 million in 2015, with about 85% receiving premium credit tax assistance. HHS' current enrollment estimate for 2016 is in the range of 11 million to 14 million, which reflects a significant slowing of the growth rate due to the combination of factors. The general consensus is that we'll now take up to 5 years to achieve the original CBO estimates of 21 million.\r\nAnd according to the Kaiser Foundation, the likely upper limit of marketplace enrollment is in the range of 20 million to 25 million, with the key drivers being the combined effect of higher penalties and IRS enforcement, coupled with more targeted enrollment marketing. But on the limiting said, there are factors at play that could end up reducing the cap, such as core affordability issues, increased premiums, high churn rates and just increased HHS compliance enforcement.\r\nLast of the changes for 2016 concerns marketplace open enrollment dates, which are shifting yet again. For the 2016 calendar year coverage, open enrollment began on November 1 and will end on January 31. The biggest practical implication for filers who choose to stay uncovered is, after January 31, these clients will not only be faced with a shared responsibility payment for 2015, but they will be essentially locked in to the much higher penalty rates for 2016 as well.\r\nAnd while healthcare.gov has made big strides, the enrollment process continues to be confusing for many in terms of selecting the right plan with the right coverage and deductible levels, as well as ensuring access to preferred doctors, providers and prescription drugs. That's why we're continuing our enrollment services partnership with GoHealth to provide health for any H&R Block clients needing professional enrollment guidance.\r\nSo what does this all mean as we head into 2016 tax season and beyond? I'd like to share some implications and expectations. Let's start with 2016. With millions of new 1095 documents being sent out, we expect there to be lots of consumer confusion, and our tax offices will be ready to address the full range of clients' questions and concerns.\r\nNext, we think higher penalties will be a painful reminder to those who have not acquired qualified coverage. And when combined with increased IRS enforcement, would trigger increased interest in professional expertise around acquiring exemptions, which is another area we are set up well to address client needs.\r\nMany of our ACA clients will experience big tax refund surprises. This represents both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is to address our client's emotional reaction to a reduced refund by clearly demonstrating our efforts to leave no stone unturned in trying to maximize their outcome. The opportunity is to add value by providing personalized advice that puts our clients in a better position to make informed decisions going forward. In overall terms, we expect the volume and magnitude of ACA will continue to broaden and deepen, which means the relative importance of ACA tax expertise will also grow.\r\nNow looking farther in the future, we expect the mix of ACA-related tax forms to shift over time. We expect instances of more complicated reconciliation and exemption forms to grow, while the relative proportion of less-complicated penalty worksheets decreases. This will be driven by increasing marketplace enrollment, higher and higher penalties, vigorous IRS compliance and interest in exemptions expertise. We also expect over time that our volume of ACA-impacted returns will continue to grow over the next 2 to 4 years, from our current 16.4% to between 20% to 25%, depending on how the key drivers play out. This combination of tax form volume and mix changes has the potential to positively impact client growth, retention and revenue.\r\nWe've covered a lot of ground in a short period of time today. We looked at our prior tax season's ACA-related results, we identified major changes for the upcoming tax season and even shared our view of future drivers' impacts and expectations. But there's one thought I'd like to leave you with today, is that we believe we are best positioned to take advantage of the opportunities presented by ACA because of our unique brand assets, our deep tax expertise, the unrivaled investments we've made in our network readiness and the ACA profile of our clients. And that these opportunities will continue to develop over time as the impact of the Affordable Care Act broadens and deepens. Thanks for your time today.\n\n---\n\nI always want to hear Mark's point of view on that stuff for me. Anyway, good morning, I'm Greg Macfarlane, and I'm really going to wrap things up here today. So I'll conclude the presentation by providing a financial view on the strategy and topics that were presented in more detail today. Now, I'll do so by focusing on H&R Block's unique role in this industry, with a specific look at the company and the issues impacting our industry. I'll also provide some thoughts about our financial structure and our outlook.\r\nBefore those, however, I'd like to take a moment to review the pass quarter. It's been a busy quarter, and I'll provide some context around the recently completed bank divesture and the changes to our capital structure. First, a few words about our second quarter results, which we released yesterday. As you're likely aware, this is a seasonally slow quarter for us. One in which we report a loss.\r\nRevenues for the quarter decreased by 4.6% to $128 million. While we saw a slight improvement in our off-season result in the United States, these were more than offset by the negative impact of foreign currency rates in Australia and, to a lesser extent, Canada, as we translate those results into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.\r\nTotal operating expenses increased by $43 million, or 13.5%. This increase was expected, resulting primarily from approximately $22 million in transaction costs related to the bank divestiture and capital structure actions, which I'll talk about shortly. Additionally, occupancy costs and amortization expenses increased due to the annualized impact of acquisitions of independent tax preparations -- preparers and in particular, the franchise businesses last year.\r\nAs a result, net loss for the quarter increased 26% to $143 million and a loss per share increased 32% to $0.54 per share. While our losses were higher year-to-date, in a business as seasonal as ours, it's difficult to read too much into the off-season results. As many of you know, tax season performance during our fourth quarter represents a substantial majority of our revenues and earnings for the year. \r\nTurning to discontinued operations. Sand Canyon remains engaged in bulk settlement discussion with the counterparties from which it has received a significant majority of its asserted claims. It's accrual for representation of warranty obligation increased modestly by $4 million to a total of $154 million as of October 31, 2015. Though there is still work ahead and while it will take time, Sand Canyon continues to make progress in its efforts to wind down its remaining obligations.\r\nWith that, let's turn to the divestiture of H&R Block Bank and our capital structure changes. There would be no conversation about the first 1/2 of H&R Block's year if we didn't talk about this more fully, so let me take a few minutes to walk back through a bit of history just for the sake of completeness.\r\nAs we stand here today, H&R Block is no longer in the banking system. We were simultaneously able to enter into a new bank relationship that allows us to offer our bank products going forward to our clients. That then allowed us to go ahead and move forward with announcing our capital structure and making some very specific steps forward in realizing that. Now, I'm not going to spend much time going through the history of the actual application, but I do want to talk a little bit about why were in the banking situation and the value these offer for us.\r\nAt the core basis of our relationship, with hundreds of millions -- excuse me, tens of millions of our clients, is this basic financial transaction that they trust us with that information. And we know that over the years that if we have the right product, the right financial product available to them, we can add value to their lives and make some money too. That need has not changed in this. To recognize that need many years ago, H&R Block decided to start a bank de novo. We chartered the bank, capitalized the bank, and ran that bank very successfully for a number of years. Unfortunately, in the 2008 banking crisis, there were substantial amount of changes that affected all the banks in the banking system, and in particular for H&R Block, H&R Block, Inc., the parent company, was deemed a savings and loan holding company.\r\nThe main implication of that was that we would've been required to build up an additional almost $1 billion of capital to support an overcapitalized bank. We looked at a lot of alternative solutions for us to be able to continue to keep the bank, but be able to meet these compliance rules, but were unable to. And so the natural and formal conclusion we came to is we need to enter the banking system. 620-odd days later, we finally received regulatory approval. And I will not go through those 620 days with you, because I'm through my counseling now. But the point of it is, on October -- excuse me, on August 5th, this summer, we received the go-ahead to go ahead and formalize our transaction and we were able to, in less than a month, close that transaction successfully. The reality is, there was a lot of work to get that done and I'm quite proud of our team that we were able to do that as smooth as possible.\r\nAs we stand here today, we are no longer a savings and loan holding company, and we have successfully transitioned all those operational requirements to our new bank partner, BofI. In fact, as we stand here today, if you went to one of our stores, you could apply for the Emerald Advance preseason loan offered by BofI, and things have gone well so far and we have great expectations for the season and seasons to come, that this is a great relationship for ourselves and for our clients.\r\nThere is a cost, however, to this transaction. And I need to just walk you through very specifically the cost numbers here so that your models are as accurate as possible as you think about H&R Block in the new world. This chart shows you the annual impact and I've broken it down both between revenue and expense, and on the far side, the EBITDA or pretax net income side. In total, on a go-forward basis, you should expect about $36 million to $41 million of negative impact on our EBITDA to this transaction. \r\nThat is broken down to 3 subcomponents. The first and primary one, which is the amount of money that we will owe on our new bank partner, ever season [ph] for doing this transaction. The main basis for that economics is really one around transactions. The more cards we sell, the more the cards are used, the more Emerald Advances, the more refund transfers, they will make more money. We would estimate that between $30 million to $35 million of net cost per year to the company.\r\nThe second cost that we incurred is that during this time frame, we had accumulated a lot of cash and kept some of that money in marketable securities. Those have since been liquidated and sold, and we will no longer receive interest revenue of approximately $6 million per year. The third and final piece is really more just an accounting thing for -- it's more of a technical point, as we're no longer sort of deemed a financial accounting model, we are now going to change the way we recognize some revenue and recharacterize expenses.\r\nAs you notice, there's no net impact to this, but it will decrease our revenue, but the offset will go to expenses. In total, for this tax season, we are guiding you to say this will impact us by about 1 full point on revenue and 1 full point on EBITDA margins. It's important to please update your models.\r\nThis is the cost page. Let me move to the benefit side of this conversation. By selling and transacting our bank, we're now able to be back in control of our balance sheet, and we outlined to you at the beginning of September what our capital structure looked like. The first step was actually redoing our line of credit. We were successfully able to renegotiate a larger line from $1.5 billion to $2 billion, and at the same time, renew it for a 5-year time period. \r\nThe second step was really to go ahead and begin raising some long-term debt, and we actually executed a 2-tranche bond deal early this fall, as you can see the details here. To be honest, I was actually quite pleased with the execution of that, and we're glad we got it done. The third step was really the share repurchase program. Our board authorized us, over the next 4.5 years, to purchase up to $3.5 billion of shares. This covers 4 full tax seasons. We made an initial down payment with a successful tender offer that we completed this fall, where we purchased $1.5 billion worth of our shares at an average price of $37, representing 40.5 million shares. And as you can see at the bottom of the page, as we stand here today, our average shares outstanding are about 236 million. \r\nAnother important point though is more strategic. We have worked very hard to get back to this core business of tax preparation. And we talk about our strategy about being a leading global consumer tax company, our capital structure needs to reflect our business model. And as business people, when you look at this model, there are really, in my mind, 3 unique things to point out. The first is just the cash flow nature that we enjoy here. We have a strong cash flow profile. In fact, from the time at which I transact from a client's perspective and recognize it as revenue to cash collection is either days or weeks.\r\nSecondarily, the amount of capital that we need to reinvest back in the business would be described as modest, when you look at the comp curve with the S&P 500. We are a mature footprint. We have a scale DIY product, and typically that requires about 3% to 4% of annual reinvestment to continue to make that sure it's fresh and contemporary. The third thing, which is a very real issue for H&R Block is this extreme seasonality that we have as part of our model. We are the most seasonal company in the S&P 500, and our capital structure needs to reflect that. The CLOC that we renegotiated at $2 billion, solves that problem.\r\nAnother important point that I want to talk to you about is a little bit more technical, and this is really about our debt capacity. As you know, we've been investment-grade for 60 years, we've reaffirmed our commitment to be an investment grade. For us, it's a technical matter right now. We're BBB stable, Baa3 stable credit. We have quantified what we think investment grade looks for H&R Block, between 2.5 adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA to 3x. And I want to spend a minute actually talking to you about the adjusted growth debt calculation, just to make sure that you all have it straight. \r\nThat calculation is made up of 3 subcomponents, the first is the obvious debt that you can look up on the balance sheet at any point in time. The second factor is following a rating agency convention, where they look at operating leases as a pseudo debt instrument, and they factor that into your debt. So that needs to be taken care of in your calculations. And the third step here is that we are seasonal. And while most of the year we don't have any money outstanding in our CLOC or historically commercial paper, we do borrow quite heavily, for example this time of the year. \r\nAnd the proper way to model that is to take the average for the year, which we're seeing is about $400 million. If you take those numbers, compare it to where we are right now in terms of our adjusted EBITDA, we stand somewhere between 2.2 to 2.5x adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA. So please understand that as you're doing your calculations.\r\nNow, this needs to be put in a broader context. One of the key investment pieces that we have that we think many of you are attracted to is our ability to return cash to you in a very efficient way. And there are 2 primary ways we do that. First, of course, is our dividends; and secondarily, is through our share repurchases. What you're seeing here is our track record since 2010 for those 2 components. What you might not be able to see at the bottom, actually, is we've taken that number in total, the total return of capital, and compared it to what our net income is. And what you're seeing there is for the 2010 to 2013 time frame, we were actually greater than our net income in terms of return to you.\r\nYou can also quite clearly see here in 2014 and '15, the 2-year timeout that we had, because during the saving and loan holding period, we were prohibited from buying back more shares. Now that we've moved past that, we've been back on the train of being able to buy back shares, and you can see an up-to-date chart here on the far right-hand side. This is the 6 months to date, by the way, just for the record. \r\nIn particular though, in this graph, I want to focus on really just the last 4.5 years. And the reason that matters is that's really the time that Bill's been our CEO and our management team has been in place. During that time frame, since May of 2011, we have successfully bought back a quarter of the company. We have raised the dividend by 33%, and we've been able to return a total of $3 billion, which for a market capital, about $9 billion is not a bad track record. We, as a management team, have a good track record in this area.\r\nSo with that, let me take a few minutes to reflect a little bit on some of the themes you've heard today and try to put it into more of a financial context for you. And I want to really start with what I think is the most important point overall, is this is the business we have. We invented this industry 60 years ago. We have been here for the long term and we're going to be here for the long time. And we are 100% committed to being successful in the tax preparation industry. We like this industry. It is slow growth. It is very mature. But it consistently grows somewhere between 1% and 2% of total returns per year, and we understand that. We also like the pricing power this industry has. At H&R Block, we have successfully been able to increase price per year, roughly double the rate of inflation for the last 10 years.\r\nThere are many reasons why pricing is inelastic in this industry, and I've listed a few here for you. The first is taxes are nondiscretionary. I mean, sure, you don't have to file for a couple of years, that's a short-term strategy, you're going to get caught eventually. You have to file your taxes. Secondarily, as an industry, we typically price on complexity. So for those of you that go to a CPA, the number of hours they spent on your account will correlate to how much they charge you, which is approximately for complexity. In our business, we typically look at the forms we need to fill in for you and how complicated those forms are to actually train, to execute, and the risks that's involved in those. \r\nThe third, and perhaps most important reason we have pricing power is, the majority of Americans receive this very big refund, $2,500, $3,000, $3,500. And when you look at the average charge that we pay them in the $200 range, that's a good investment of their money, to get it done right, to make sure they have peace of mind. We like the pricing in this industry. We also, importantly, know more about this industry than anybody. If you actually think about the years that we've been around, the amount of data that we've collected, the number of experiences that we've been involved in, we have this knowledge base that is a very powerful way for us to understand things. And as you -- as we move forward here strategically, we're going to take more and more advantage of that. And you saw some examples of that today through Laura Scobie's presentation. \r\nThe other implicit part of our strategy is now that we're back to this basic tax preparation company is, this is all we've got. We have no distractions with other industries. We are only about tax and we are going to live and die based on how successful we are in this industry. Importantly, we're the only company that says, \"If you want to do your taxes your way, we are here for you.\" If you want to sit at home in your pajamas late at night and just do it yourself, we're going to have a great product for you. If, on the other hand, you want somebody to sit next to you and go line-by-line and explain every aspect of your taxes with you, we've got people for you, too. And as you can imagine, there're many shades of gray between those 2 extremes, and H&R Block is really the only company that can deliver that. \r\nThis is a large industry. It's $20 billion in total. And as you can see here from the graph, we're the largest participant in the industry. But you can also see that we have room to grow here. What you've seen from us today is an articulation of the strategy that says we now have an answer and a plan to deal with independence. We also now have a plan and an approach to CPAs. And of course, we always worry about our assisted competitors and our DIY-branded competitors. We believe, over the next several years, that we will continue to grow a larger share of this market. \r\nThe other important part of our model is we are a medium and long-term thinking management team. We are here for the long term. This is the way we make decisions. The average American starts filing at age 18, 19 or 20. They then file for an additional 60 years or so, and H&R Block wants to be considered every year along that journey, that's an important part of our strategy.\r\nNow with that, let me spend a few minutes talking more about what we at Block think are some of our competitive differentiators and our sustainable competitive advantages, and that really starts with our brand. If you think about H&R Block, this is a ubiquitous term, it means taxes. In fact, 96% of Americans know exactly who we are. And when you ask them who we are, they would say things like taxes, trust and expertise, exactly what we want.\r\nAnd that's a direct result of decades of experience doing hundred millions of returns and spending hundreds of millions of dollars on our brand. Any competitor that comes into the tax space is going to have to fight this brand. And if you think about this, in fact you heard Jason talk about it, this is going to be a source for growth to us in the DIY, because awareness is still not at the 96% there. And there's a strong correlation between awareness and DIY and our ability to grow successfully in the future.\r\nThe next advantage is we have money to make things happen. Our first priority, of course, is to make sure that we invest from a CapEx and expense basis back into this core profitable business, and we're doing that. The second priority for us, of course, is to invest in what we call strategic initiatives. And you saw some examples of that today with our DIY investment, you saw that with our Block Advisors, you saw that with our health care ACA investments. This is an important part of our ability to be more relevant and to grow market share over time.\r\nNow the nice thing about H&R Block is even after we finish investing in these 2 areas, we always have cash left over in terms of supporting the dividend and at times, of course, being able to return additional capital to you. This is a nice business model.\r\nNext is our distribution. We are pervasive. If you cannot go onto the Internet and you cannot go into a distribution in terms of where software is available, you cannot go anywhere in the country where you won't be able to find H&R Block. This is a very real competitive issue in this industry because you're always going to have to compete against H&R Block. Today, you heard a new expression of this distribution strategy really around Block Advisors. The clients that we're focusing on here are clients that we've got familiarity with, and they've got familiarity with you -- with us through our H&R Block Premium experience. \r\nThe reality is that we did not pay as much attention to this over the last several years. That's changed, and you heard Laura talk very specifically about some of the exciting ideas that are going on there. We are focused on winning here in the medium and long term. Importantly, from my perspective, in terms of financial model, the cost that we will be incurring for CapEx and expenses to support this program are in all of our current guidance for you, so there'd be no additional expenses or CapEx required to help this transition. But, also importantly, this is not a 1-year solution for us, we are committed to this. And success for this case will be measured over the medium and long term.\r\nNext, I want to spend a few minutes talking more broadly about the industry and some of our thoughts on them -- on these issues. First of all, we talked to you about 3 different forms of fraud happening in this industry at a great level of detail. We think it's important as investors in this company to understand this very macro issue. Our view is that there's a lot of overlap between them. Quality and fraud are a growing issue in this industry and it's distorting the results. It's also creating an unleveled playing field for companies like Block that play by the rules. \r\nOur view is that this will be fixed over time. Standards are inevitable. It's just common sense. I cannot, however, look at you and say this will be fixed in one year. But if you're a medium and long-term investor and you look at the realities and the facts of the situation, I hope that you conclude, as we have, that this is inevitably going to be fixed, and Block will be a key part of getting that done.\r\nThe next major thing we talked about really is the strategic change in the DIY space. As many of you know, historically, there's been a value segment that has a value product and a value price. There has been, on contrast to that, a premium segment that has a premium product and a premium price. And what's happened here in the last 2 years, is the premium product provider has basically pushed pricing down to the point where the value players who don't have a good-enough product will not -- no longer be to compete for those value people. And we think as time goes on here, in the next few years, these smaller competitors in the DIY space will get squeezed out of the industry. Their product will not be able to keep up with what's being offered by the market leaders here. And we believe that H&R Block is very well positioned to take advantage of this change.\r\nThe next topic really is one of health care. And we've talked to you a lot about health care. We're very interested in health care. The ACA was the biggest change to the tax code since Ronald Reagan was president in the 1980s. This is a big deal for our industry. And what I want you to take away from this is that, in particular, at Block we feel like we're the best people to provide solutions for taxpayers. We have a lot of strengths in this area, and it's an area that we're investing money in and will continue to invest money in. But make no mistake about it, this is not a 1-year opportunity, this is a multiyear opportunity. And the reason why is because it deals with people's behavior. And the reality is it's hard to understand how people's behavior is going to change. Things are changing already, there'll be more this year and there'll be more in years to come. \r\nOne question I do get a lot from you is, \"Can you help me to quantify this?\" I don't have all the answers for you, but I want to provide you a bit more of a structure to think about as you continue to reflect on ACA and H&R Block. When we talk about a client being impacted by ACA, there's only 1 of 3 ways they get impacted from our perspective. The first is they actually chose through the health care exchange to buy a policy. At the end of that year, they now have to do a new reconciliation form. Okay? That's a premium tax credit reconciliation on this chart. \r\nThe second situation is an individual who should've gotten health care chose not to, and they now have to pay a penalty. Those people, when they do their taxes, have to fill in a new worksheet or series of worksheets. The third category is that person who will be subject to a penalty, but because of their circumstances, may be eligible for a partial or full exemption. They also have new forms to fill in during the tax event. This bar chart that's on this page is actually proportionately accurate for how those 3 categories broke down last year using IRS data.\r\nAs we go forward in the future, these things will change, what we'll find is less people will be subject to the penalty, more people will be applying and getting exemptions for part or all of the year. And of course, more people will be getting health care, and therefore, then have to fill in a premium tax credit reconciliation. Why does this matter? Well, this is mix. And if you remember the way we charge is based on complexity. The more complex the work we do, the more we charge. And from bottom to top, we charge more money. This is a mix-based pricing opportunity for us. The proportions on the right-hand side are directional, by the way, not completely forecasting accurate.\r\nThe next phenomena that I would say is working in our favor, is really what I would call the unit side of things. Last year, 16.4% of our clients were impacted 1 of the 3 ways that we talked about in the previous page, and we expect over the next few years that number will be 20% to 25%, representing more economic opportunity for H&R Block to make money.\r\nThere are other economic opportunities available, but these are 2 primary ones that we talk about. So hopefully, that's a little bit helpful for you. Moving on, I do want to talk a little bit more financially for you. And that conversation for me always starts on the top line, really about revenue. A successful H&R Block is a Block that actually is showing growth in the 4 primary drivers of revenue. We're seeing price, we're getting reasonable volume, we're seeing a reasonable mix, and we're able to attach products onto that.\r\nSo let me spend a few minutes giving you my perspective, really on last year and some of our thoughts going forward. Prices have very real opportunity in this industry. I talked to you about the fact that we have low elasticity. We have spent a lot of time understanding the data behind that and turning price into more of a tactical, historical solution for Block into one that's more strategic. And we're very pleased with our results in pricing and expect pricing opportunities to continue to be available to us.\r\nIn terms of volume, we are not happy with our volume results. What we have though done, is clarify what the issue is. We are not winning the early season EIC and we're embarked on a multiyear journey to fix that problem and you heard some of our plans today from Laura, and it's an overall theme as a management group that we're very focused on.\r\nIf you set that aside, however, we are actually okay with our volume results. We can always do more. But the reality is, that if it wasn't for that one group of people, we would be okay with our volume. In terms of mix, as a company and as an industry, we have done a bad job educating U.S. investors on what mix matters, okay? Let me give you a simple example. We know, with a high degree of probability, that an EZ filer will continue to be an EZ filer for the next several years. We present value that relationship back, include the additional products we might sell them, include their propensity to take ACA and look at them as a lifetime value. \r\nThen you do that same type of math with someone who's more of a 1040, like many of you people in the audience. The difference in lifetime value between those 2 clients are magnitude differently. We're talking more than 10x. And we, at Block have spent a lot more time to understand what that math looks like, to understand what we can do and where our strengths are, and to change some of the way we communicate and hold people in terms of behavior in the field. We're doing okay in mix in our perspective.\r\nThe fourth category, really, is one of attach. We talk about this as our Tax Plus strategy. And here, the 2 main variables, of course, are getting more products available. As an example, last year, we offered Tax Identity Shield, which is a new product to the industry, an example of H&R Block's innovation. And frankly, were very pleased with first year results, and expect that product to continue to be more and more relevant. The second thing we focus on attach, of course, is our existing 5 products that we have, can we sell them to our clients? And if you look over the last 3 years, we had a good track record of being more and more relevant for more clients, and we expect these trends to continue.\r\nNext, I want to talk a little bit about EBITDA. At H&R Block, we start with approximately $3 billion of revenue per year and we turn that into almost $1 billion of EBITDA. It's a fairly remarkable business model. On a percentage basis, you can see over the last several years that we've operated in the low 30% range. As a matter of guidance, we basically indicate we expect Block to continue to be in the 28% to 32% range. Just for contrast and comparison sake, I'm showing you here what the average S&P 500 company is. We're a very profitable company. \r\nThe next I really want to talk about is capital. Now, we talk about a CapEx range of being somewhere between 3% to 4% of revenues per year. And as you can see -- you may not be able to see, but that last dot is what our guidance is for this year. I'll get -- at the end, I'll confirm all that for you. But we expect to be within that 3% to 4% range. We were elevated for 1 year in 2014, which was really making up for some previous years prior to 2011, and so -- where we were underinvesting in the business model. \r\nThis is the cash view. When you now turn to more of an accounting view and talk about depreciation and amortization, there's a normal time lag. So what I'm showing you here at the top of the page now is how depreciation and amortization is behaving. As expected, as you increase from 12, 13, and 14-year CapEx, that then takes time to come through depreciation and amortization line, which is kind of what you're seeing here. But I want to be clear with you, it's not the only reason depreciation and amortization is going up. So what I'm going to do for you now is break down depreciation and amortization into the subcomponent parts.\r\nAs you would expect, the main driver of depreciation and amortization is CapEx, which is the bottom larger bar. Normally, we have a program where we have 50 people whose job it is to go out and actually look at independents to buy them. And the way that gets accounted for is part of the purchase price we pay for them is capitalized and then amortized over time. And if you notice that sort of that middle, that green bar, independent acquisitions, and that reflects a normal $35 million to $45 million of investment that we make in those. Very stable, doesn't change too much.\r\nThe one thing you'll notice in 2014 and very pronounced in '15 and we're sure will be in '16, is this onetime opportunity that we had to buy back a bunch of our franchisees that had been sold several years back. That program is going to actually wrap up the year, and I'll be a bit more specific on that later on.\r\nWhile I'm talking here about independents and franchisees, let me reflect a bit more strategically on this. We do have a team of people whose job it is to go out and find competitors that may make sense to come into H&R Block's family. Several years ago, management's decision was to sell a number of prime H&R Block territories to become franchise territories. The 2 basic strategies behind that were: One, we think they actually operate the stores better than Block can. There's no evidence to support that before, after and during that time frame.\r\nThe second strategy, of course, was to generate a quick gain on sale. We went back and looked at that program and made the strategic decision to go back after those 600 stores, which we started last year and will complete this year. Last year, in fact, we bought back 340 stores. This year will be about 260. At the end of this year, we're pretty finish with that program. Once we finish that program, however, we will continue to do what we've always done, which is to look for quality independents to bring them into the H&R Block family to the tune of $35 million to $45 million per year. Importantly, in both cases, when we do the math on it, I'll give you a simple example, we're able to buy them at compelling financial returns. H&R Block trades at roughly 10x EBITDA, ballpark. When I buy back these independents, when I buy back these franchisees, I'm typically paying somewhere between 2x to 3x earnings. The moment at which that transaction closes, I'm able to create financial arbitrage that benefits you as an investor. \r\nNext I want to talk about our efficiency of investment. The reality is if we use return on equity, given our recapitalization, we're now pretty much at [indiscernible] so we prefer to talk about return on invested capital. This is a number -- or this is a metric that we think is actually very relevant. Now as you can see, our history was one that we weren't paying attention to up until a few years ago, but we've been successfully able to move our return on invested capital to the mid-20s. What I'm not showing you here, though, is under the new world with the recapitalization and things to come, what it will look like. But I will tell you, you'll find us go to the mid-30s here very quickly. What's even more impressive, when you compare that to our cost of capital, the line at the bottom, for every dollar of equity and debt that we're given, we're able to basically generate a 2x to 3x return on that. So very strong ROIC. \r\nNext, income taxes. Now for those of you that are -- have been here multi-years, the normal conversation for income taxes is we give you what we think the tax rate will be for this year. Well, this year we're going to do it differently, we'll actually give you forward-looking guidance on tax rates. I joined H&R Block in 2012 and when you look back at what our tax rate was for many years before that, what you saw was effectively Block paying at the high end of the corporate tax rate at approximately 40%. The other thing that many of you may not know is that we at Block actually had real issues with how we accounted for. We had controllership and compliance issues in our income tax area. \r\nIf you roll the clock forward to today, what you've seen is we've been able to materially drop our tax rate by a full 5 points as well as fix all the compliance and controllership issues. This change, itself, just the tax rate over the last 3 years has generated $100 million of cash savings for the company, which is part of what was refunded back through the share repurchase program earlier this year. \r\nNow going forward, as we look through our next several years and where we think we're going to be at, I want to provide you guidance that we think our expected base tax rate will be 35% to 36%. So please update your models to reflect that. \r\nSo moving on. I now want to give you actually a bit more specifics on the outlook, and these are more of the modeling-type questions many of you are looking forward to. So starting with really just the broader view of what we think returns will be, no news. We think it'll continue to be about 1% to 2% growth in total returns in the United States, both for this year and as we look out over the next 3 years. There will be some differences between assisted and DIY, really with the DIY continuing to benefit from really the tail end of the pen-and-paper filers that are converting over to DIY. That will moderate and we will expect the DIY to actually slow down. \r\nNow specific to H&R Block, I went through a slide before with you, but I want to reinforce this very important impact from the bank divestiture that we completed earlier this year. This year, our revenues will be impacted by negative 1% because of the bank transaction. It will also impact EBITDA by 1 full point. And because that's an annual cost, that will go forward for the foreseeable future. \r\nNext, we have incurred onetime costs, as you would expect, to transact both the bank and our recapitalization. Most of that cost, by the way, was recognized in the second quarter, but it'll be a small amount here for rest of the year. But in total, we expect those onetime costs to be about $22 million. They're one time; they will not reoccur next year or the years out. \r\nNext is foreign exchange. It's a reality that every company with international operations is facing right now. As it stands here today when we look at the Canadian dollar and the Austrian dollar, it will impact my reported revenues by 1% this year and will have a much smaller impact on earnings, but it will be about a $0.01 of earnings this year. We do not forecast foreign exchange rates and so therefore I'm not going to be able to give you a 3-year expectation of what that looks like. This is just accounting, but it's a real issue. \r\nNext are compensation and benefits expenses. As many of you know, last year, we actually increased our compensation and benefit, specifically training, to include the costs for rolling out the ACA, the health care strategy that you heard from Mark. And we also, last year, incurred some costs because we introduced a new system in our tax stores that actually drives the tax interview. That was successfully completed. And so those costs would actually come back down this year and they are. Offsetting that, however, is with us buying back a lot of these franchisees, we're bringing those staff on now full-time year around and therefore our C&B costs, our compensation and benefits costs, will be up. If you put that aside, all you're going to see there for this year and the years out really is more inflationary. And we've done a good job controlling our C&B costs over the last several years. \r\nNext is our adjusted EBITDA margins. Our margins this year are expected to be 29% to 30%, really exclusively because of the things that were listed above here. As we go out into the future, we'll continue to guide to 28% to 32%. That is not a forever statement, that's a short-term and medium-term guidance on what we think EBITDA margins should be for H&R Block. \r\nNext is interest expense. We successfully completed a $1 billion bond deal earlier this year. We're also now utilizing our CLOC and so that will be interest expense between $66 million to $69 million this year. There is no forward-looking guidance in here or for the 3 years about when and how much we would do additional debt raises. This is simply reflective of the debt that we've done to year as well as our seasonal liquidity interest costs. \r\nMoving on. In terms of CapEx, we'll continue to guide between 3% to 4% of revenues for this year and for the next 3 years. In terms of A&D/franchise buybacks, the program that we embarked last year in buying back our franchise partners is basically winding down, so that program will finish. But this year, with the completion of additional 260 of those offices, plus our normal level of independent acquisitions, we expect to spend somewhere between $90 million and $100 million and then we would typically then go back to a more normal range, which would be $35 million to $45 million in the years following. \r\nNext, in terms of depreciation and amortization, we expect to incur somewhere between $175 million and $180 million this year. And as you can see, I've broken it down into the subcomponents. I'm not going to get into that right now, however. In terms of the next 3 years, really because of the way that D&A lags the cash expenditure, we would expect it to continue to be elevated at $180 million to $195 million. \r\nNext. In terms of our tax rate, I did give you the 3-year-plus expectation where the base rates were between 35% and 36%, but for this year, because of some continued onetime opportunities, we expect taxes to be somewhere between 33% and 34%. So that may be something else you want to adjust in your models. \r\nAnd then next, in terms of our average diluted shares outstanding. Right now, we're expecting 250 million to 250 million (sic) [ 250 million to 255 million ] of weighted shares outstanding for the year. But as you know, as a primary practice of ours, we don't give forward-looking guidance on share repurchases. So we're not saying whether we will or we won't, but this is kind of where we stand right now. So hopefully, that's helpful. \r\nThis is really the summary of our presentation for you. Many of you are familiar with the overall investment thesis, but what you've seen today hopefully is an articulation at a more level of detail about the excitement and the opportunities that H&R Block has available to us. We think that H&R Block represents both a greater growth opportunity as well as a very compelling value opportunity for you. \r\nSo thank you all for coming. Thank you for your time today. Give us a few minutes and then we'll be able to do Q&A session with you all. Thank you.",

And on behalf of the H&R Block management team, it's my pleasure to welcome you here in attendance and those participating via the webcast to H&R Block's December 2015 Investor Conference.\r\nWe have an informative and exciting morning plan for you, and are glad that you're able to join us.\r\nBefore we get started, we have a few housekeeping items to take care of. Yesterday, we released our fiscal 2016 second quarter results. That release as well as today's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures and the schedules attached to the press release, and you can find those, both the release and the schedules, on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.hrblock.com.\r\nI'd also like to remind everyone that today's presentation and various comments made in connection with it will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As such, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2015 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.\r\nShortly after this morning's presentations conclude, we'll post the slides on our Investor Relations website. As a reminder, our webcast will also be available for replay on the website.\r\nTo give you a sense of today's agenda, opening presentations will run until approximately 10:00 Eastern and then we'll take a 15-minute break. Refreshments will be available throughout the morning and on a quick logistical note, restrooms are out the door and to your right, just past the registration table.\r\nWe then expect to begin Q&A around 11:15 Eastern. So again, welcome everyone. Thank you for being here today, and we hope you enjoy the presentations.\r\nI'd now like to introduce our President and CEO, Bill Cobb.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Cobb (Executives)】\nGood morning, everybody, and welcome to this year's investor conference. We're pleased to have you join us.\r\nToday, we're going to share with you a look back at this company's transformation, the opportunities we see going forward and how we will continue driving value for shareholders. And we have a great lineup of speakers this morning. So let me begin with those introductions.\r\nFirst up, Kathy Pickering, our Vice President of Regulatory Affairs and the Executive Director of the H&R Block Tax Institute. Kathy is going to talk about the impact of tax fraud and the lack of standards on this industry and how H&R Block is leading the industry in partnering with the IRS and others to address these problems.\r\nNext on the agenda, Laura Scobie, our Vice President of Client Insights. Laura will talk about the dynamics of the tax season, our seasonal promotions and the launch of a new brand to better serve clients with more sophisticated tax situations.\r\nThen Jason Houseworth. Jason leads our Tax Product Strategy and Development group and is going to discuss trends in the DIY industry and how we're positioning ourselves for continued success in that category.\r\nThen, as Colby said, we'll take a 15-minute break and when we return, Mark Ciaramitaro, our Vice President of Taxes and Health Care Services. Mark will discuss the Affordable Care Act, what we learned in 2015 and how we see that impacting our business in the industry in 2016 and beyond. And finally, Greg Macfarlane, our Chief Financial Officer. Greg will talk about our second year and year-to-date results, review all the recent changes and activities and then pull it all together with a detailed financial view of why H&R Block is a good investment.\r\nBut before we get to them, I want to spend a few minutes addressing 3 topics that will help provide context for the remainder of the morning. The first is a look back at H&R Block's transformation over the last few years. Then I'll address some key issues affecting the tax-preparation industry. And then I'll close with the company we are today and why we look to the future with great optimism.\r\nSo to fully understand the transformation of H&R Block to the company we have today, we have to first understand from where we came. And as many of you know, the period of 2007 to 2011 was an extremely difficult one for this company. To be blunt, the company was in turmoil. Business results were lagging, and we were attempting to be a financial supermarket through diverse business lines that were taking the company away from its core tax business.\r\nIn short, H&R Block was unsure of what it wanted to be and who its clients were. All of these factors combined to create leadership challenges. There was an activist involved, the company had a revolving door of CEOs, 4 of them from 2007 through April 2011. I joined the Board in August 2010, and so I'm often asked why I took the CEO job. Well, it's because I knew this was a great company with great products and, as I've come to learn, great people. So I was pleased to say yes when the Board asked me to step into the CEO role beginning in May 2011.\r\nStarting out, I knew the company needed focus, focus on our core tax business, and focus on sustainably growing the top line and improving margins. So we went about executing -- exiting noncore businesses. We had already stopped originating and servicing mortgages through option 1. So our next step was to sell RSM McGladrey, an accounting and consultancy business.\r\nWe also divested a smaller underperforming business, Express Tax, and a tax software company, RedGear. But this company needed to grow revenue. So we not only focused on the fundamentals, we innovated as well. We created and implemented a new strategy in fiscal 2013, Tax Plus, which has grown to 5 products that have added value for our clients before, during and after the tax season. And it's important to note, we're the only company with a suite of products like this, a key point of ongoing differentiation.\r\nTogether, over the period of fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2015, our Tax Plus strategy has generated accumulative product revenue of over $1.2 billion with overall growth of 11% over 3 years.\r\nThe company's transformation was made possible by a stable leadership team that has executed on our strategy over the last 4 years, and we expect this team to continue.\r\nIn June of this year, the Board extended my tenure through September 2018, so I plan to be here as CEO for the foreseeable future.\r\nAnd the members of my senior leadership team have multiple tax seasons under their belts with proven results.\r\nIn August of this year, we completed the final step in our transformation back to a focused tax company when we finalized the divestiture of our bank. Now I have to admit, the bank was starting to feel like my life's work, but we did get it done. And with this final step, we are much better suited to bring even more value to you, our shareholders, through an appropriate new capital structure and the freedom to make capital structure decisions without regulatory oversight.\r\nH&R Block has a long history of returning capital to shareholders. For example, in January, we will pay our 213th consecutive quarterly dividend, that's over 53 years and counting.\r\nAnd during my tenure, we've increased the dividend by 33%. Continuing on this tradition of returning capital to shareholders, in September, we outlined a strategy to put an appropriate capital structure in place for our business going forward. Our Board approved a $3.5 billion share repurchase program effective through June 2019. And as part of this, we executed a $1.5 billion tender offer in October, purchasing over 40 million shares at $37 per share.\r\nWe also replaced and upsized our existing line of credit to $2 billion and issued $1 billion of new long-term debt.\r\nIncluding the tender offer, all of this translates to total repurchases of over 76 million shares since I started in May 2011. That's about 25% of our outstanding shares at an average share price of $26.38.\r\nI'm proud of these accomplishments, but I'm even more proud of the fact that we did what we said we would do. So as you can see, these changes have resulted in a fundamentally different company, one transformed from the unfocused financial supermarket of 2007 to the company of today, one focused entirely on tax preparation and related products.\r\nSo what has this transformation meant for our business results? Company revenues have grown for 3 straight years after a multiyear revenue decline. Profitability has dramatically increased with EBITDA increasing $136 million and EBITDA margins improving 5 points since fiscal 2012 to approximately 31%.\r\nIn digital, our revenue growth has outpaced the industry over the last 4 years as more and more consumers become aware of our DIY products. Our international operations generated revenues of $239 million in fiscal 2015. Our established businesses in Canada and Australia saw a significant growth in local currency revenue, and we have the beginnings of solid businesses in new markets.\r\nAnd we've invested back into the business where it's made sense. We've enhanced our retail stores inside and out, strengthened our systems and technology infrastructure, designed and implemented new tax-preparation software and as part of our growth strategy, we bought franchise and independent locations at compelling returns. And the total impact of our actions and performance is that the market has responded very favorably. Our stock has outperformed with S&P 500 by greater than 50% for the last 5 years.\r\nSo with that look back at our performance, I'd like to shift to the present. Based on how we've executed on our strategic vision, it should be crystal clear how committed H&R Block is to continuing to lead the industry we invented over 60 years ago. As the leader, it's important that we take a view on important new issues impacting the industry. While I will briefly comment on some of these issues, the presenters following me will go a bit deeper on each.\r\nThe first issue is tax fraud. For many of you here, you know this is the third investor conference in a row in which I've been talking about the need to address fraud in a holistic way through a public-private partnership.\r\nInterestingly, a competitor, who has been talking about its industry leadership on this matter, began doing so only after it ran into a major problem in the middle of the last tax season. And that problem was SIRF or Stolen Identity Refund Fraud, which reached new and especially alarming levels this past tax season. But this problem is not new. As I discussed at last year's investor conference, from 2010 to the 2013 filing season, the most recent years for which stats are available, there've been over 2.9 million victims of tax identity theft.\r\nAnd as we saw in the last filing season, the problem became so extensive that it now threatens taxpayer confidence in the system.\r\nAnd as a result, earlier this year, the IRS convened that public-private partnership, which includes H&R Block, other members of the industry and state tax authorities to develop solutions that will better protect taxpayers who use DIY methods.\r\nI'm encouraged by the progress made so far and Kathy Pickering will talk to you about that progress and what still needs to be done. But it's important to remember that stolen identity refund fraud is just one part of the overall problem of tax fraud. There are others such as fraud or improper payments associated with the earned income tax credit. Simply put, DIY filers don't have to answer the same EITC eligibility questions as those who get help with their taxes. And the result is a high level of fraud or improper payments. It's our belief that the slight migration we're seeing from assisted to digital is primarily due to fraud, committed by EITC filers and identity thieves. Were it not for fraud, we believe this slight migration wouldn't have occurred. In fact, excluding fraud, the percentage of filers getting assistance may have actually grown. Kathy Pickering will go deeper on this issue in the next presentation.\r\nThe final point I'll cover on fraud is the lack of minimum standards for return preparers. In short, this lack of minimum standards is enabling fraud, perpetuated by unscrupulous tax preparers. Now you've heard me say it before, all 50 states have minimum standards for barbers and hairdressers, yet only 4 states have minimum standards for those who perform one of the most important financial transactions of the year for millions of taxpayers. That makes no sense. We need prudent commonsense measures that include mandatory testing, continuing education and background checks for all return preparers. The outcome of this problem is still to be determined, but we are seeing encouraging movement in legislative circles to address it. \r\nH&R Block has been the clear industry leader in fighting tax fraud, and you won't have any trouble finding where we stand or what we've said about all of these important issues. And we'll continue to lead and make our point of view abundantly clear to policymakers and administrators, and you'll hear some of that later this morning.\r\nNow you may be wondering why does H&R Block keep talking about fraud. It's actually very simple. The measures we advocate for will level the playing field across the industry, reduce fraud and better protect consumers. It's as simple as that.\r\nNow the next issue I'll discuss is complexity and the potential for tax code reform. It's been a topic of the current political campaign, just like it's been a topic of campaigns over the last several decades. The fact is complexity in the tax code is a result of the government administering public policy programs through the tax code, like the EITC or buying a home or saving for retirement. These are very important programs and impact virtually every American. And complexity certainly impacts our business, too. Remember, we have to thoroughly understand and follow the law. And so we have to train over 80,000 tax professionals every year to ensure they're ready to serve our clients.\r\nAn example is the increased training cost we incurred last year to prepare for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. In fact, last season was the first time many Americans navigated the intersection between their health insurance and taxes. The ACA directly affected over 3 million of our clients. In this coming season, the ACA will impact even more as the number of people in the exchanges steadily grows. We've said all along that the opportunity presented by the ACA will take several years to fully unfold. But I remain very confident that H&R Block is particularly well positioned to serve our clients going forward. Mark Ciaramitaro will give you our update later this morning.\r\nAnd regardless of whether progress to simplify the tax code actually happens, we know there are basic enduring truths to which tax filers subscribe. They want to pay only the taxes they owe. They want the maximum refund to which they are entitled. They want their tax return to be accurate. And they want to minimize the stress and hassle of filing their taxes.\r\nToday, in total, the U.S. tax code and supporting documents are over 74,000 pages long. But in 1955, when we first started, the tax code was much simpler. Still, clients came to us in droves, so much so that Henry and Richard Bloch were able to invent this industry. And so we believe by any logical conclusion, as history has clearly shown, people want help with filing their taxes. But as you know, we are the largest tax preparer serving the entire landscape of filers. Whether clients want help from our highly trained, skilled tax professionals or to do it themselves using our best-in-class software, it doesn't matter. We serve clients however they want to be served.\r\nSo to this point, you've heard me describe the company's transformation, our new capital structure and how we have led the industry during some tough challenges. And while we're proud of our accomplishments, we understand what matters most is the future, and we couldn't be more excited about the future, for both this industry and for H&R Block. The tax preparation industry is steady, and in many people's minds, not very exciting. But I can tell you that nothing can be further from the truth. Whether it's the challenge of implementing complex new tax laws like the ACA, tackling big issues affecting millions of Americans like fraud, or navigating the ever-changing landscape of the assisted DIY categories, there is much work to be done. And when you are committed to doing the right thing as H&R Block is, these challenges ultimately translate into opportunities. And so the tax-preparation industry isn't just necessary, it's still an industry with opportunity.\r\nFor decades, people have needed and wanted help in preparing and filing their taxes. 135 million individual tax returns are filed during the tax season and counting. And no one is better able to help these tax filers than H&R Block, the clear industry leader.\r\nVirtually everyone knows our brand. With our 10,000 retail offices, we have unmatched scale. Our 80,000 tax pros are the best in the industry. And our innovation from our DIY offerings to our Tax Plus products, to our progress in global markets, these are just a few examples of how this company is leveraging the power of its brand to grow.\r\nThis growth opportunity is uniquely combined with a stability not often found in other sectors. We generate over $3 billion of revenues on an annual basis and our profitability is growing.\r\nOur return on invested capital is nearing the top decile of the S&P 500, and our record of returning capital to shareholders is proven.\r\nSo even though we're in a steady slow-growing industry, H&R Block has room to run. As you'll hear a little later, we're bringing new ideas to the table in our assisted business to better align our services with the dynamics of the tax season to meet the challenge of growing early-season clients and to serve our clients who have more sophisticated tax situations.\r\nIn digital, we continue to grow revenue and awareness of our great DIY products.\r\nOur international business continues to be fast-growing with exciting opportunities in India and our Expat services. And our innovative Tax Plus products continue to meet a growing need for more and more of our clients.\r\nSo in conclusion, I've covered a lot of ground this morning. And from my comments, I think you can understand why we're excited to be in this industry, why we will continue leading it, and why we think H&R Block is a great investment. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Kathy Pickering (Executives)】\nHello, I'm Kathy Pickering. I've been with H&R Block for over 17 years and I've held a number of different roles during that time. \r\nToday, in my current role as Vice President of Regulatory Affairs and Executive Director of the Tax Institute at H&R Block, we're talking about the impact of fraud and the lack of standards on the tax industry. You've heard the term fraud thrown around a lot, but I'm going to talk about 3 very different types of tax refund fraud: Improper payments on the Earned Income Tax Credit or EITC, return preparer standards and Stolen Identity Refund Fraud or SIRF.\r\nOn the surface, these types of fraud seem quite different, but there are 2 common themes: A lack of consistent minimum standards and the anonymity of the DIY product, which opens the door for tax refund fraud.\r\nBut why should you care about these issues? Well, as you will see later, we believe that fraud is distorting industry and competitor results, and the solutions that are being implemented for next tax season and beyond will help level the playing field and Block will benefit because of this. But you should also care because the amount of fraud and the dollars represented are staggering. Of all the EITC payments, 22% to 26% a year are improper payments or between $14 billion and $17 billion. Of all the federal benefit programs, including Medicare and Social Security, the percent of EITC improper payments is, by far, the worst.\r\nFor comparison, Medicare has an 8.5% improper payment rate and Social Security, it's less than 1%.\r\nOn return preparer standards, H&R Block has unique insight on competency across the industry. Over the last few years, our acquisitions team has screened thousands of independent tax firms who are interested in becoming H&R Block franchisees.\r\nThese potential acquisitions need to meet certain minimum criteria such as number of returns, professional appearance and adequate computer systems before we'll seriously take a look at them. One step in our evaluation process is to review the actual tax returns in order to assess the level of quality. The results are shocking. We are finding that nearly 1 in every 2 prospects has some form of noncompliance and 1 in 4 is committing fraud, such as falsely inflating refunds to attract new clients. And this is what we're finding from the firms that have been prescreened or qualified, so supposedly, we've weeded out the worst firms before we spend a lot of time on them.\r\nTurning to Stolen Identity Refund Fraud, this problem is growing worse. Starting in 2010, there were roughly 400,000 incidents and it has grown to some 2.9 million incidents through 2013, the last year for which we have data.\r\nWhy is this problem growing worse? Because like this New Yorker magazine cartoon of years ago shows, the Internet allows anonymity. Simply put, current gaps in authentication allow criminal online filers to easily mask their identity. And remember, there've been no minimum standards in place. And the problem of Stolen Identity Refund Fraud is reaching a tipping point, meaning, it must be addressed effectively or else it puts the entire tax administration process at risk. H&R Block is leading the way forward for this industry and when this problem is effectively addressed, not only will government, industry and consumers benefit, but H&R Block may benefit as well because we've led the way on developing solutions and it will tip the balance back to a level playing field.\r\nWith all that as a backdrop, now let's go a little deeper into each of these 3 fraud areas.\r\nLet's start with EITC. EITC is an antipoverty program for low income working families. The maximum credit for next year will be about $6200, that's a lot of money, especially for a low income family.\r\nFor most, it's the largest single financial payment of the year and for working families, it can be a lifeline. They use that money to cover bills, often late bills or pay for car repairs, rent and just catching up.\r\nThe rules for EITC eligibility may seem fairly simple, the children must live with the taxpayer for at least 6 months and the taxpayer has to have earned income, but it's never that simple. Especially in complex family structures such as blended or multigenerational families. So proving who cared for the children and where they lived can be difficult. The government doesn't call it EITC fraud, but rather, improper payments. Because it's a mixture of things, payments made to the right household, but the wrong person, lack of documentation or actual fraud. And given the sensitivity around this program, there's no publicly available data that shows how treasury classifies the improper payments between unintentional mistakes and actual fraud.\r\nWe know that about 22% to 26% of EITC payments were improper in taxes in '15 and that amounts to $14 billion to $17 billion last year.\r\nAnd there is a history here of billions in fraud and improper payments each year, it's absolutely mind-boggling. That's why we're so passionate about driving change in this area. We need to implement practical measures to reduce the fraud, and in doing so, protect the EITC program for those it was meant to benefit.\r\nI want to spend just a minute on the relationship between filing status, income, number of children, and how that impacts getting the maximum EITC credit. If you look at this chart, the X axis is for income and the Y axis is for the EITC credit amount. For example, in 2014, if you were a single head of household with 3 children, and you wanted to get the maximum credit of $6143, you would see that you needed to have income between $13,650 and $17,850. If your income was more than that or less, you would not get the maximum EITC amount.\r\nFor a fraudster, filing an online tax return, it's quite similar to using the solve 4 function in the spreadsheet. And many EITC returns managed to file exactly within that income range. Coincidentally, these returns may also have a Schedule C, which is the form for self-employment, small business profit or loss, which enables the fraudster to either increase income or reduce it with expenses to stay right within that sweet spot, without any additional documentation.\r\nAs we've discussed in previous investor conferences since the increased due diligence was required when an EITC taxpayer chose to use a paid preparer, the EITC filings are migrating from paid preparer to DIY methods and the fraud problem is migrating with them.\r\nIn 2008, it was roughly 70% assisted and 30% DIY. \r\nIn 2015, it has migrated to 55% assisted and 45% DIY. And during that same period of time, assisted returns, excluding EITC returns, actually grew at the same rate as the industry. This really doesn't make sense. EITC returns can be complicated and many families want help preparing that return. Thus, the shift to DIY is difficult to explain other than for the growth in fraud.\r\nThere are several reasons that DIY makes fraud easier. The increasing availability of online technology enables an anonymous transaction and doesn't require the signature of a third-party preparer. Access to online tax prep software facilitates that solve 4 function to maximize the claim. It's much less risky to do a what-if analysis online versus sitting in front of a preparer, and saying, \"Well, what if I claim another child? What will that get me?\" And with online methods, you don't have to provide any documentation or answer intrusive questions.\r\nIn contrast, paid preparers are required to document additional, and sometimes, embarrassing information to verify the EITC claim. If they don't, the preparer can be penalized $500 per return even if the tax return itself is correct and the taxpayer isn't being audited.\r\nSo to avoid those penalties, some independent preparers become ghost preparers, which means they use DIY software to prepare the return and don't even sign it, often the taxpayer doesn't even know.\r\nSo to the IRS, it looks like a self-prepared return and, of course, with an aggressive DIY competitive offer for free federal and free state e-filing, fraudsters don't even need to have a credit card to pay the fees, which means they can dodge another point of verification.\r\nBut there is some good news. Government and industry are making progress. For the upcoming 26 filings -- 2016 filing season, H&R Block, along with 3 other software companies, is part of a DIY pilot test run by the Treasury Department. This pilot will measure the impact of additional questions on DIY filers claiming the EITC.\r\nAnd IRS has retrained their due diligence auditors so that they will no longer be required to ask paid preparers to ask certain invasive questions. And there's more to come for 2017. The IRS is expected to have consistent EITC eligibility requirements regardless of filing channel, plus the IRS has asked Congress for additional legislation, such as the ability to reduce the refund amount of EITC for claims that can't be substantiated.\r\nSo will this stop EITC fraud? In the short term, no. But in conjunction with return preparer standards, all the SIRF fraud fighting initiatives and other legislation we hope and believe that this will reduce EITC fraud and improper payments. It will get fixed. It's simply a question of when.\r\nSo now, let's shift gears for a quick update on minimum standards for return preparers. Currently, there are no federal minimum standards in the industry. The IRS's attempt to implement the return preparer program was overruled by the courts in 2014 despite stating in their opinion that they thought the program was needed. Congress needs to give the IRS this authority, and it just hasn't gotten done yet. In response to the IRS's inability to regulate at the federal level, the states are implementing their own state return preparer programs. California and Oregon have had programs in place for a number of years and Maryland and New York have recently implemented programs. And we're aware that there are a few other states like Illinois that are also looking at their own programs, and we support that because there are no federal standards today.\r\nLooking at the case of Oregon, it provides compelling evidence that establishing return preparer standards makes good sense.\r\nIn a study done by the Government accountability office, they reported that paid preparers in Oregon were more likely to file an accurate tax return as compared to the rest of the country. And for Oregon's 1.6 million individual tax filers, this equated to over $390 million more paid in federal income taxes, more than if they had been prepared by preparers in the rest of the country.\r\nRight now, to be a paid tax preparer, all the IRS is able to require is a PTIN or a Prepare Tax Identification Number, and in order to get a PTIN, all you need is a name, Social Security number, date of birth and pay a $50 fee and answer a couple of questions.\r\nH&R Block has much higher standards. We've been in the business for 60 years, and we understand what it takes to competently and ethically prepare and submit a federal or state tax return. We set high standards for all 80,000 of our tax preparers. H&R Block requires each one to stay current on the tax law and comply with the rules through 60 hours of basic income tax training, a competency exam and 18 hours of continuing education every year.\r\nWe also conduct background checks and have an internal compliance and ethics oversight program. Clearly, for taxpayers who choose to get assistance, competency and ethics should be table stakes.\r\nFinally, I'd like to spend some time drilling down on Stolen Identity Refund Fraud. To commit SIRF, all a fraudster needs to create a false tax return is name, Social Security number and date of birth, that's it. And with DIY software, it's an anonymous transaction. There's no identity or other validation required. The fraudster simply creates a fraudulent return, e-files it and typically funnels the stolen money to an account. For anyone who does online banking, you're accustomed to having to validate your identity, but not so for tax filing. There are no minimum requirements for the tax industry to do any validation. The nature and scale of refund fraud is changing. We have this example of an individual posting on Facebook that she was the queen of IRS tax fraud and taunting the authorities. Well, she was arrested and sentenced to 21 years in prison.\r\nOver the last few years, the fraudsters have evolved. There are now international and domestic organized crime rings with sophisticated IT capabilities. They have a good understanding of the tax code, especially the holes in the tax administration systems. They have computer programmers who write scripts to submit returns in large volume. And based on what gets rejected versus accepted, they can methodically reverse engineer the IRS and state fraud filters.\r\nThere have also been large-scale data breaches ranging from Target and Home Depot, to Anthem and the office of personnel management. Stolen data is widely available for sale on the dark web where criminals can buy it in volume. And with computer scripts that they write, they are able to submit hundreds, thousands, possibly millions of fraudulent returns through online methods. Even if only a small percentage makes it through and pays out, it means a huge payday for the fraudsters. This kind of fraud is almost a perfect crime. The probability of getting caught is relatively low, but the payoff is very high.\r\nThere are other reasons why SIRF has grown. There has been a rise in the availability of anonymous accounts, such as unauthenticated debit cards to make it faster and easier to negotiate the stolen funds. And as we've discussed, millions of personal identities are available for exploitation.\r\nAnd social media provides a platform for the fraudsters to share their best practices, real-time learnings about what's working and what's not. \r\nAs you know, H&R Block has been an industry leader for years and that leadership includes the security protocols we've had in place. For example, we required and accepted federal return before filing a state return. We have a team of dedicated fraud analysts, and we authenticated identity for our prepaid Emerald Card and many other things that we're not going into. \r\nClearly, to protect consumers against this growing threat, government and industry needed a cohesive and unified way forward. So Bill Cobb called on Commissioner Koskinen to bring the industry together in a public-private partnership to fight fraud. Commissioner Koskinen's background and experience as the Y2K czar uniquely positioned him to know how to bring together such different organizations as the tax industry, the IRS and the states. And all of us have differing agendas, levels of technology sophistication, capability, and budgets. But everyone can agree that we have a common enemy, fraudsters, and a common goal, fighting fraud with a unified defense for 2016 and beyond. All of the industry has to implement a consistent set of standards; ensuring a level playing field is critical, or else the fraudsters will simply go after the weakest links. \r\nSo how are government and industry leveling the playing field? Remember, one of the key reasons that SIRF has increased is because the DIY online filing process is virtually anonymous. In part because the IRS and the states can't always see the tax filer behaviors such as what device was used, which IP address the return was sent from. So a number of measures are being implemented at the federal, state and industry levels for the upcoming tax season. Under authentication, there are a number of tools being put in place to help verify the identity of online filers and implement strong security protocols. Examples of these measures include requiring stronger passwords and asking security questions if something is different or appears suspicious. \r\nFor H&R Block, we already had most of these standards in place. So for us, our work is about refinement. For some of our competitors, this is a whole new way of doing business. Another component that is critical for detecting and fighting fraud is appropriate information sharing so government and the industry are addressing that too for the coming tax season. Tax-preparation companies with more than 2,000 returns will be required to conduct fraud monitoring and analysis, and share their findings or report leads to the IRS in a timely manner. It will be done through a secure infrastructure and process that will respect taxpayer rights and protect personal identifying information. Again, not a heavy lift for us as we've had the fraud program in place for over 3 years. \r\nFor a government industry effort that is as interconnected as this, these are really important commonsense steps. These changes will be in effect in January, just a month from now. \r\nLooking to the future, there will be additional changes in 2017 and beyond. In the areas of security technology, centralized information sharing and financial products, H&R Block is well positioned for these changes. We believe our relationships with the IRS and the states are on solid ground, which better protects our programs and products. \r\nSimply put, our competitors have to catch up with us. For the assisted independent competitors, many without an IT fraud or compliance staff, the risks become that much greater. For the smaller DIY competitors, many have not had centralized fraud detection and compliance capabilities. Now they have to scramble to create this. \r\nThe potential consequences are great. We've seen states refuse to accept e-filing from companies who have unacceptable levels of potentially fraudulent submissions. Again, H&R Block is well-positioned. The work to defeat the fraudsters is a good start, but more work needs to be done. This is a holistic problem, and it can only be solved by all of us working on it together, the IRS, our competitors, and the states. More work needs to be done in standards, technology, investment, and legislation. None of the steps taken individually solve the problem, but all of these steps combined in tandem with the IRS, the states, and industry will make a positive difference. It's the right thing to do for taxpayers, and it's the right thing to do for the tax industry. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Laura Scobie (Executives)】\nGood morning. I'm Laura Scobie, and I lead the client insight team here at H&R Block. I'm going to talk to you today about 3 things that focus on growing our assisted tax business. \r\nFirst, I'll review our strategic foundation for growth, and that is consumer segmentation. Because the customer is the driving force behind all major business decisions, you will see it woven throughout other topics in today's discussion. \r\nStarting with our plan for achieving growth in the assisted business early in the tax season, and moving into a new brand launch that focuses on an important consumer segment that until now was only partially addressed with our current model. \r\nStarting with segmentation. Just a quick overview for you. We have decades of experience understanding tax filers and their needs. We constantly refine and deepen this knowledge base. This deep knowledge of the tax filing universe, some 135 million filers in the tax season, shows us exactly what they want from tax-preparation. This customer knowledge is a sustainable advantage for H&R Block. We're able to group people with similar tax needs into distinct segments. \r\nThis isn't data for data's sake. Our understanding of the tax marketplace is deeper and better than anyone else in the category, and we're leveraging that knowledge in every decision we make. Today, we're talking about segments in terms of 3 broad groups. This is just to illustrate a point. It's actually much more complex than we'll discuss today. \r\nThere are defining attributes that surround each segment, and I could go into great detail, but I summarized it into the key things I want you to know about each segment. \r\nFirst, for people in Segment A, these clients have needs that are all about the money. For these tax filers, the refund is likely their biggest payday of the year and they want to maximize their refund each and every year. \r\nNext, Segment B is a high-touch tax segment that needs year-round service. They value assistance, but believe their tax situation is too complex for just any tax preparer to handle. So they're willing to pay for more expertise. Our research shows that 65% of tax filers fall into segments A and B. This number has remained fairly constant over time. \r\nFinally, tax filers in Segment C believe they're capable of preparing their own return, so they want a DIY method. Jason Houseworth will talk more about our DIY business later today. \r\nWith the detailed understanding of how each of these segments wants to be served, we have a way forward for how to win all types of new clients based on what they want and need. \r\nTo fuel new client growth in our assisted tax business, I'd like you to meet Diane, who represents Segment A. She works 60 hours a week as a waitress, is a single mother of 2 and receives the earned income tax credit because she is 1 of the 33 million whose economic situation allows her to qualify for this program. When it comes to tax prep, Diane wants all the deductions she's entitled to, and she wants to know her tax preparer did everything possible to help her. \r\nThe need for the refund is so great that most of Segment A file as quickly as they can. When we looked at Segment A's return count over our 4-month tax season, January and February saw the highest volume of Segment A returns, with a spike at the end of the season. January and February are what we refer to as the early-season. The sooner they come in, the sooner they get their refund, which to many like Diane is her annual bonus. \r\nI'd like to put this in context of our total tax season '15 results. Last year, we saw that our client loss came solely from the early-season. We saw steady growth during the late season, which was encouraging. Our analysis of the early-season showed that 1/3 of the client loss was driven by our decision to eliminate the free easy program. But more importantly, the other 2/3 of the client loss was made up of EITC clients. Looking deeper, we found this isn't unique to H&R Block's assisted tax business. EITC clients were down across the assisted tax prep industry in total. But it was particularly concerning to us for a couple of reasons. EITC clients are highly valuable and they're a group that historically H&R Block has done well with. We're a brand that is well-known and respected by EITC clients, we have products that benefit them, and we are skilled at handling the complexity that comes from EITC forms. H&R Block does meet several needs of the EITC client. To start to win them back, we had to craft an early-season program that appealed to their hearts and their minds. To do this, we leveraged what we learned from talking to hundreds of clients firsthand, sitting in their homes, having coffee with them, which I was doing in this photo taken just last Friday, talking very openly about their lives. And the bottom line is we know what really matters to these folks. We know what it takes to win them back. And winning them back starts now. On January 9, you will see, hear and feel a powerful early-season program from H&R Block that will make a positive difference in the lives of our clients. It will stand out in the marketplace, it will be impactful. \r\nFor competitive reasons, I'm not sharing this initiative with you today, but I can assure you that come tax-season, you'll be very aware of it. But \r\nI can tell you about the targeted marketing we used to reach these tax filers. Through our segmentation, we know, for clients and non-clients alike, who switchers might be. These are people who are most likely to consider H&R Block, and even those who may think about leaving us. We can then go directly to them with enticing offers that matter to each of them. Our customer relationship management is a capability we've invested in over the past 2 years. It allows us to expose specific groups to targeted products and messages that meet their needs. And of course, we can speak to them in their preferred language. \r\nWe also use W-2s to target customers with offers. We can purchase W-2s based on industry of employment and tailor our messages accordingly. This is just the first step in a targeted multi-year multidimensional plan to win back EITC clients. We know this client loss happened over a number of years, not just last tax season. And we know it will take an investment of time and resources to get them back. We created a plan that will force consideration or reconsideration of H&R Block. It starts with targeted marketing and includes an improved client experience that speaks to Segment A, as well as taking a stance through government relations in a way that benefits these consumers. \r\nLet me say a little about each of these other items. Starting with the client experience. We continue to enhance our experience to make sure that we're delivering the right environment for this early-season client. We're hiring more tax pros, improving their training and enhancing their skills. We'll have more bilingual associates to help Spanish-speaking clients maneuver through the system. It means continuing to leverage technology to personalize the experience. The tax interview will be customized to the client sitting across the desk. This client experience gets them through the process and out the door with the maximum refund. For government relations, which Kathy Pickering spoke to, this is about standing up for our clients and protecting them where they need our help. As Kathy explained, the 3 areas of interest are: return preparer minimum standards; EITC fraud and improper payments; and Stolen Identity Refund Fraud. These are the 3 pillars of our multi-year, multidimensional plan to win back EITC clients. We're excited about this comprehensive plan. \r\nSo that's Segment A. Now let's shift to an equally exciting growth area, and that's with Segment B. Segment B has a different and more complex set of tax needs. This client is looking for an added level of expertise when it comes to taxes because they believe their tax situation is complicated and they're probably right. They're looking for a tax professional that's available year-round to answer questions and meet with them if they need it. They expect to work the same preparer every year because they want their tax professional to get to know their personal situation. \r\nWe have a portion of our offices that currently meets the needs of Segment B. That is H&R Block Premium. Premium started in 1982, and we currently have around 300 offices across the country. Premium tax professionals are experts at navigating a wide variety of complex situations. They're capable of doing anyone's taxes. In fact, these tax professionals have delivered for Segment B clients year after year. Historically, the premium business lacked focus. But with our tax professionals' capabilities, our current footprint, and the underserved Segment B audience, we decided to give it more attention and more closely align it with the needs of Segment B. \r\nWith Premium as our starting point, we created a new brand and business model that's more intensely focused on serving Segment B. Happy and excited to introduce to you today, Block Advisors, an ideal tax solution for the millions of Segment B clients that have real help -- or need real help with their complicated tax needs. Because this is a different consumer, we will meet their needs in different ways. Block Advisors gives clients a private office and a more intimate experience. The offices are more sophisticated, more CPA like, but still approachable. Block Advisors will address your complex tax needs, as well as provide tax planning and year-round tax advice. \r\nAnd in many cases, these Segment B clients have other needs as well. For example, about 1 in 5 of them are small business owners. Block Advisors will offer them payroll, bookkeeping, business tax services, and of course, we will be there to handle their personal taxes as well. \r\nWhat a perfect opportunity to deliver on a real need. So what we have are 2 businesses, 2 types of clients and 2 avenues for growth. \r\nTo recap, H&R Block has served us well for 60 years and will do so for another 60. Within that business model, tax is an annual financial event. It's about well-trained tax professionals who work hard to get their clients every dollar they deserve, and it's largely about the refund. Block Advisors meets the needs of a different consumer segment. These clients have year-round tax needs, they're more complex and have needs that may extend into planning and small business services. And importantly, tax is one part of their financial plan. Different consumers, different needs, different value propositions. Block Advisors will launch with 287 offices nationally. Most of these are converted H&R Block Premium offices. The cost associated with this fits within our ordinary capital expense plans, which Greg will outline later. We expect to grow the Block Advisors brand over the next few years, building a larger footprint as we establish this value proposition. \r\nI told you a lot about Block Advisors and the clients they will serve, but now I'd like to show you a video that really brings this new brand launch to life.\r\n[Presentation]\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Laura Scobie (Executives)】\nThe Block Advisors website is now live, so we encourage you to go to the website for more information at blockadvisors.com. \r\nIn closing, we're excited about our plan for growth. It's based on understanding and meeting client needs across all segments. H&R Block now has 2 distinct brands and each is positioned to serve different types of clients. These brands can literally sit side-by-side, and prosper and grow because they have 2 distinct value propositions. This focus allows us to build solutions that differentiate rather than just trying to meet the basic needs for all. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nGood morning. I'm Jason Houseworth, and as the President of Product Strategy and Development, my role is to create great experiences for all of our tax clients. \r\nAnd today, I plan to share what we believe is a winning formula for DIY clients and discuss how this formula is designed to succeed going forward within the digital category, given 2 key trends shaping this dynamic category: the material presence of fraud, and the convergence of value and premium. \r\nBut I'm going to start by outlining our winning formula in this competitive environment with the goal year in and year out to outpace the category in overall e-file growth, and grow profitably as we do it. \r\nAs Laura just mentioned, at the highest level, we categorize tax filers into 3 general groupings. We look at these groupings aligned with the 60-40 split of assisted and DIY users and believe strongly our DIY products should be designed for the roughly 40% of tax filers who choose to do it themselves. These users have specific needs that they're looking to be fulfilled or validated within the tax offer experience. They're confident in their ability to perform tax-preparation. And, in contrast to the assisted user, they want to control the process. They love the flexibility and convenience of preparing taxes on their own schedule. And finally, they expect a trade-off, that is to say, to be rewarded for the investment of their time with a lower price. \r\nThis is the do-it-yourself client, and these are the requirements that form the basis of our maniacal approach to build the best tax software in the digital category. You should recognize our formula for this client from last year's investor conference. It has 3 components: product innovation or delivery to the consumer of intelligence as a service; a multiscreen focus to design first for the native device, whether it's desktop, smartphone or tablet; and a brand that has awareness and can support the full set of integrated tax services that consumers expect. \r\nOur focus, first and foremost, has been consistent product innovation. The result of which has been a dramatic set of changes that have completely redesigned the product since 2011, both on the surface and behind-the-scenes. \r\nIn tax season 2011, our product was primarily on focus on conversion or the rate at which registered users become completed or filed returns within our tax interview. And this data-driven approach led us to recognize the key areas of opportunity within the product, but also led us to what was then a small but exponentially growing number of mobile users. \r\nWhile we were able to optimize this flow from a conversion perspective, we recognized the opportunity to design first for the mobile user, really as a chance to start over, to rebuild the product from the ground up, beginning with this version in 2013. This was Version 1 of a product designed to be optimal on every screen size. But the focus of the redesign wasn't just on conversion and the need to design the interview for a mobile screen, it was also to enhance the user's perception of value, especially for more complex tax users. How can software deliver on this to the DIY user? By embedding logic to help anticipate what the user needs, like how our interview can begin by taking a picture of your W-2 to automatically pull name and address information as opposed to asking you to manually enter it on your phone. Our ability to import tax form data, including the 1095 -- 1095A import feature to auto populate your health coverage details, the way we proactively recognize things that you may have otherwise forgotten to take advantage of, through a feature that we call Pro Tips, and giving you the desired confidence you expect by demystifying things that don't make sense, like through our Refund Reveal. Refund Reveal is a unique trademark feature released in our product for all users in tax season 2015, and it exemplifies how we deliver on the central expectation of the DIY user to understand how the software calculates the refund. In a way that enhances value perception. \r\nThis feature is unique in the digital category, and it differentiates H&R Block tax software and our expertise to the DIY user. All of these features that I've mentioned are now live in this year's product, and collectively, they represent, what I call version or year 3 of our redesign. \r\nAnother example of our consistent focus on product innovation is how we've iterated on MyBlock. MyBlock, for those of you who haven't already created your account, is the virtual account available for all H&R Block tax clients, DIY and assisted, to maintain a year-round relationship with our brand. It also represents how the product innovation we've developed in our tax software area is adding value for assisted clients. Launched in tax season 2013, MyBlock has been used by over 8 million clients, more than half of which are assisted clients leveraging this tool to do things like review their tax history with H&R Block to access prior year returns and other supporting documents and to visualize the personal history that exist inside their tax data that's securely held by H&R Block. Product innovation has propelled advancements for both the DIY and assisted H&R Block clients. But for the DIY business, the most important thing is how this translates to results. \r\nSince Bill took over as CEO 4 years ago and empowered us to pursue this winning formula, we've seen the 7% tax return or e-file growth and the 9% revenue growth as validation of our innovation and testing process. I'm especially pleased in the quality of our growth over this time period with a new 1040 or complex clients growing the fastest. We also know that we must be mobile-first in our design thinking so that we create a responsive, multiscreen product. That is to say, our products must seem to the mobile or tablet user as if the product was designed specifically for that device. Our focus in this area to design with a multiscreen mentality for all 6,000 of our federal and state product pages has improved our waterfall for all clients over the past 4 years. But it is been most dramatic for mobile users, as we've improved conversion by more than 30 points as a result of this effort. This helps us more efficiently convert the clients that our marketing efforts help add to the top of the funnel. And speaking of marketing, we know that the whether DIY users are value or premium consumers, they will demand that their software be built by a great and trusted brand. \r\nOver the past 4 years, we've seen awareness that H&R Block makes tax software grow 16 points, from 51% to 67%, 67% is a number that both dwarves value competitors, because it has taken significant investment to achieve, but it also has a lot of headroom and therefore continues to represent the largest opportunity to challenge the category leader. \r\nSo that's our winning formula, a formula that created unit and revenue share gains in tax season 2015, and one that we see as a winning formula going forward with one update. We will continue to ensure we are the industry leader when it comes to proactively preventing fraud and providing a secure platform from which to file. This has long been a consistent and continual focus for H&R Block, but a fight that we have waged alone, until this past tax season. Thanks to the leadership of Kathy Pickering and others within H&R Block, we're pleased to see others in the industry adopt many of these standards that we've had in place for years, which leads me to the first of 2 trends shaping the digital category, fraud. \r\nMany of you have asked me how do I see fraud or to quantify the amount of fraud in the digital industry. So I thought I would share a few anomalies within the IRS' own data that point to the material effect of fraud and on the filing patterns and how this fraud is distorting competitor e-file growth. \r\nSo let's begin with Florida federal e-files and some very concerning fluctuations over the past few years. Typically, we say that return growth should match nonfarm employment or conversely, unemployment. And the gray bars that you see, they represent unemployment rate for tax seasons '12, '13 and '14, rather steady. In Florida, the unemployment data varied slightly, but it generally follow the national unemployment averages. Now let's see how closely IRS e-file and Florida e-file data matched up. It's interesting to see that Florida did not file -- follow the national trends in e-filing. Importantly, Florida has no state income tax requirement so it's a good barometer to use to evaluate federal tax filings. We would normally expect e-file rates to follow IRS filing data given it matched almost exactly with unemployment data. However, it not only varied in tax season 2013, it varied dramatically, given historical filing fluctuations typically fall within a low range. \r\nWhat explains this? Is it because Florida return filing patterns changed unexpectedly? Or because possibly, that fraud that was being generated from Florida shifted to originate from other states? Our view is that as federal fraud filters shifted to scrutinize returns originating from Florida addresses, that the fraud moved to originate from other states, something easily accomplished via online filings. \r\nThis is why the change the category leader made to allow its customers to file their state return absolutely free without the requirement of an approved federal return seemed more in line like a quest for volume rather than \"consistently leading the fight against potential refund fraud, \" which was a statement that served as a headline at their recent investor conference. \r\nDuring an interview in the middle of last tax season, their Chief Information Security Officer admitted that this unlinked state return practice had created 3 to 37 fold increases in state-only returns, returns that the company was convinced were fraudulent. The change to correct this was made in early February, a month after the launch of Absolute Zero, and past the first peak of the filing season. \r\nNow let's discuss IRS or federal e-file rejects. And for some context, a federal e-file reject can be rejected by the IRS for a whole host of reasons, and I would say many of these are valid, like when a DIY user fat fingers their Social Security number, and it doesn't much the IRS database. These e-files get rejected and then they're returned to the user to correct. However, if we assume that these mistakes are common across DIY users, then it would mean that generally we would expect the rate of rejects to be consistent across all software providers. But what I'm going to show you is that it is not. \r\nAnd so the question you should be asking yourself is, why would it be different? Now I want to show you a chart that demonstrates federal e-file rates -- pardon me, federal e-file reject rates or the percentage of filings that were rejected by the IRS by provider over the last 3 tax seasons, and I'm going to start by showing our own reject rate, which has been the industry's lowest reject rate for the past 3 tax seasons and one that has continued to come down as we've improved our backend fraud monitoring, and security controls. \r\nSo next, you see the category leader. They are the first example of how a higher reject rate can correspond to higher e-file growth. In tax season 2014, their e-file growth of 9% came with a 5-point or nearly 30% increase in rejected returns. This by the way, was their largest e-file growth that they've had since 2011. \r\nHere the reject rates of another major online competitor, which has continued to grow overtime. But if you want more evidence regarding how the reject rate corresponds with e-file growth, here's an online competitor who saw strong 8% e-file growth in tax season 2013. But when their reject rate was cut in half, their e-file growth halted. Interestingly, another online competitor saw their own reject rates spike the next year, which corresponded with an increase in their e-file growth. In fact, it almost doubled in size. My argument is that fraud exists within the system, and it can likely be seen as it moves around the system. We continue to partner with the IRS in order to push for industry standards in order to prevent this. \r\nAnd just one last note before I leave this page. I've included the reject rate of H&R Block's assisted business on the right. Our rate that is lower than all DIY competitors, half of retail competitor Liberty Tax, and one that has only marginally changed over time. \r\nLet's continue discussing trend shaping the digital category by picking up on a topic that I covered last year during our Investor Day. \r\nDuring that presentation, I previewed the season, noting that we should continue to expect a convergence of value and premium within DIY users. Specifically, I outlined how small value competitors created through the Free File Alliance or FFA will lose their ability to compete on price alone. Our view is that even value DIY-ers expect more than what I call, pen and paper on a webpage, given that prize is no longer a differentiator. I also noted how premium DIY-ers, the most complex and valuable clients, are seeing the category leader raise price on their software to level the playing field with these value competitors. I argued then, and continue to believe now, that H&R Block is well-positioned to take advantage of both of these shifts. Our online offering puts the expertise in Tax Services of the most trusted tax advisors together with innovative, easy to use tax software that is built to lead for what's next in the evolution of the DIY category. \r\nSo let's review what actually happened in tax season 2015. First, the category leader opened the season by offering its online product free for both federal and state filing. This software both tightened the federal forms for free users, and it relaxed the state price, making it $0 for 1040EZ and 1040A filers. \r\nAt H&R Block, we offered the value DIY-er a free federal filing, coupled with a promotional offer for $9.99 state filing. And despite the existence of a $0 state price, $9.99 was still the best value in DIY for 1040 filers who were eligible for our free federal online product but squeezed in the tightening by the category leader. \r\nIn contrast, the category leader raised price for complex users. Generally speaking, many of these users were asked to pay $40 more to use filing systems, whether it's online or software, or desktop software. \r\nLet me give you an example. So the tightening of the form's coverage within their online products meant that the user of last year's free federal edition, particularly the most common 1040 user who needs the Schedule A to file basic itemization, was forced to pay $40 more to file federal and state for effectively the same return year-over-year. We held price consistent for complex users. \r\nWhat happened? Well, the result was that the category leader gained volume of simple filers meaning 1040EZ filers. We gained ground with high-value desktop, and 1040 online clients. \r\nIn desktop, we gained an unprecedented 3 points of share in a single tax season, demonstrating the impact the simple filer pricing has on previously loyal, high-value DIY clients. \r\nAnd when the final tally came from the IRS, we learned that we outpaced them in total e-file growth. And given each year, we strive for profitable growth at a rate faster than the digital category; we were very pleased with the 12% revenue growth that we saw. We see this growth as sustainable growth compared to growth via price, whether it was to fund low-quality volume by the category leader or to mask a lack of growth. \r\nTo summarize, we believe our formula in DIY is winning. Product innovation delivered seamlessly to all devices while continually growing in awareness. A formula based on sustainable, profitable growth, and given the category dynamics, one we believe will continue to win in tax season 2016 and beyond. \r\nSo we will now take a 15-minute break and come back at 10:05.\r\n[Break]\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nOkay, everyone, thank you so much for taking your seats. And now, I'd like to introduce Mark Ciaramitaro, our Vice President of taxes and health care.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Ciaramitaro (Executives)】\nGood morning. As Colby said, I'm Mark Ciaramitaro, Vice President of taxes and health care services at H&R Block. And as Bill indicated earlier, I'm back again to provide an update on the Affordable Care Act, both in terms of what happened this past tax season and what's to come.\r\nThe Affordable Care Act, along with introducing new health plan regulations, insurance marketplaces and coverage mandates, effectively created a new and dynamic intersection between taxes and health insurance. This intersection exists because many of the ACA's key provisions are administered via the federal tax code.\r\nYou'll soon see that we expect the breadth and depth of the intersection will continue to grow as new mandates, new notice types, higher penalties and increased IRS enforcement begin to phase in. You'll also hear that we believe H&R Block is best positioned to take advantage of the opportunities tied to the growing impact of ACA on tax filers.\r\nWe can't talk about the impacts of the Affordable Care Act without understanding its long-term goal, which, simply put, was to expand health insurance coverage among a large pool of historically uninsured households. And by doing so, reduce overall health care costs. ACA sought to accomplish this by driving higher quality, improved affordability and greater access. To achieve these ends, ACA regulations created a number of new mechanisms, including the individual and employer mandates, new federal and state-based insurance marketplaces and expanded Medicaid.\r\nSo with this ACA context, as an investor, you may reasonably ask, \"So why should I care and what does it have to do with H&R Block?\" Well first, it's important to understand that because of this new intersection, ACA has brought significantly more complexity and confusion to the annual tax filing process. We believe that these newly embedded tax impacts will create opportunities for the tax industry in terms of client growth, retention and incremental revenue. We also believe, based upon our industry-leading investments and assets, that H&R Block is best positioned to capitalize in the consumer needs emerging from the tax code changes introduced by ACA. That being said, we're still in the early stages of the ACA's impact, as 2015 was really the first year many the law's tax provisions took effect. As we move into 2016 and beyond, the opportunity for H&R Block will continue to evolve.\r\nThis morning's session will be broken down into 3 primary sections. First, we're going to talk about what actually happened this past filing season, starting at the category level and then moving into specific H&R Block results. Next, we will share the ACA headlines for 2016, focusing on changes typical tax filers will experience. And finally, we will close with a short discussion around future implications and expectations for H&R Block.\r\nLet's begin by reviewing the major outcomes from the 2015 tax season. While there's ongoing political controversy regarding many of the ACA's provisions, virtually everyone acknowledges that its implementation has led to a significant reduction in the percent of uninsured households in America. Gallup, one of the most widely referenced surveys, has closely tracked a material 2-year decline since the fourth quarter of 2013 from 18% to just under 12% in 2015, which has resulted in over 17 million people gaining insurance coverage.\r\nUninsured levels are expected to continue to decline, albeit at a reduced rate, and will likely achieve historic lows in 2016. But beyond the higher coverage levels, one of the most tangible impacts of the Affordable Care Act was the new notices and forms required in the tax-filing process. Those that enrolled via state or federal marketplace received a new tax information document, the 1095-A, which included critical information needed to reconcile their premium tax credits. Importantly, households that received advance payments of the premium tax credit reported on the 1095-A, must file a tax return even if their income is below that usual filing threshold.\r\nThe tax form used to calculate the reconciliation of premium tax credits is the 8962. In frank terms, this is a complicated form, requiring multiple steps to complete it. And you'll see coming up that many households made the mistake of not including this form when they filed last year or they didn't file at all. Now households who did not have insurance coverage for all or a part of 2014 and who did not qualify for an exemption, confronted a new worksheet that calculated their shared responsibility payment.\r\nFilers made mistakes on these forms as well. In fact according to the IRS, about 300,000 filers paid a penalty when they shouldn't have, another 75,000 made basic math errors. Now thankfully, ACA allows eligible, non-covered households to receive an exemption from the penalty, but they needed to include a penalty exemption form, 8965, in order to claim it. Altogether, 2015 ACA filers experienced added complexity to a tax filing process that was already daunting for many.\r\nSo how many filers were directly impacted by ACA in 2015? Well, according to the IRS, about 25 million returns either included an ACA-related tax form or needed to. Beyond the 3 million that reconciled their premium tax credits, the 8 million that paid a penalty and the 12 million that filed for an exemption, about 2 million households did not properly file or didn't know they needed to file at all.\r\nNow historically, the relative percentage of assisted versus DIY tax returns has been in the range of 60-40. But among reconciliation and penalty ACA-impacted returns, filers tended to use assisted channels at that same or higher rate; while filers who submitted an exemption form tended more towards using DIY solutions. This is an interesting outcome that may or may not tie to other fraud trends we are seeing in the category. It's too early to determine yet if filers are making different channel choice decisions based on their newly discovered complexity, but we're going to be keeping a close eye on those trends. \r\nBeyond having to file new tax forms, perhaps the most significant impact faced by ACA filers was on their refund. Despite all of the media focus this past tax season, many tax filers were caught off-guard. This is a pretty emotional topic because for many households, the tax refund is the single biggest financial transaction of the year that they count on to cover critical household expenses.\r\nThe first major refund impact concerned the shared responsibility payment. In 2015, about 7.5 million filers had to pay $1.5 billion in shared responsibility payments, with an average penalty of over $200, which, according to our figures, resulted in an average refund decline of 7% to 10%. Over half of penalty payers had annual incomes below $30,000, which correlates closely with their lower employment and insurance coverage levels.\r\nBut penalties were not the only source of refund impacts, premium tax credit reconciliation had an especially large and unexpected impact on refunds, primarily due to filers underestimating their household income when they enrolled in a marketplace plan. In 2015, the IRS issued almost $10 billion in premium tax credits, with an average household credit of almost $3,000. However, of the 3 million filers who received these credits and reconciled, just over half had to pay back a portion of that credit. Our results indicated that these clients experienced a very significant impact, amounting to over a 30% or a $730 decrease in their tax refund.\r\nOne of the signs of added tax complexity is the degree to which filers make mistakes. Based on IRS data, over 2 million households made tax filing mistakes related to ACA. Beyond math errors, probably the most worrisome trend was connected to reconciliation, as about 40% of the households that enrolled via the marketplaces in 2013 and early 2014 simply got their reconciliation requirement wrong. They either didn't file or extend with an 8962, or they didn't know they needed to file at all. The reality is, because of the added complexity, ACA-impacted households that did not get qualified assistance have a much higher likelihood of making mistakes, and those mistakes can have important ramifications even beyond the tax return, such as losing future access to premium tax credit assistance.\r\nSo after talking about ACA trends in the overall tax category, let's hone in on some specific H&R Block results from this past tax season. Let's start with one of the most important investments we made going into 2015, which is insuring our network of tax professionals with the most thoroughly equipped and trained ACA tax experts in the industry. As we shared last year, our ACA certification training was compressive, averaging 7 dedicated hours of tax theory, software practice and extensive case study work. We also deployed additional tools and support resources to assist tax professionals in handling especially complicated ACA scenarios.\r\nIn terms of 2015 tax results, we ended up investing over 600,000 hours of ACA-specific training across 80,000 tax professionals staffed in 10,000 offices. And clients who received their refund benefits of our ACA expertise gave our tax professionals higher Net Promoter Scores. We believe this strategic investment in our people will continue to pay dividends because it has ensured our tax professionals competency in handling the full range of ACA tax situations that their clients are likely to face, both now and in the future.\r\nIn terms of describing what a typical ACA impact to client looks like, based upon our year-end results, they tend to file earlier in the tax season; are substantially more likely to be lower income; tend toward being a single or head of household filer, with a higher relative mix of Latino clients; have a higher probability of being a new retail client versus do-it-yourself; tend to file either an EZ or 1040A-based tax form, including clients applying for an earned income tax credit; and finally, in terms of geography, have a higher propensity to reside in states that make up a large percentage of the historically uninsured population, such as California, Texas and Florida.\r\nAccording to the IRS, in 2015, about 16.6% of filers were directly impacted by ACA tax forms. The mix of ACA impacts, as you can see, was primarily driven by exemptions in penalty forms. H&R Block's overall percent and mix of ACA forms was similar to the tax category. That being said, we did see that the proportion of our new retail clients impacted by ACA was materially higher than those who used our DIY products.\r\nIn terms of the shared responsibility payment, H&R Block clients paid a slightly lower dollar amount than the category average, this is likely due to differences in our client's average household size and income, which in turn impacts the average penalty amount. But we expect these amounts to increase in the future as higher penalty rates go into effect.\r\nAll told, after the first full year of implementation of the Affordable Care Act, we gained some important insights. First, while a significant number of overall tax filers were impacted by ACA, the impact was heavily concentrated on lower-income segments, who typically file earlier in the tax season and tend to use assisted channel solutions. Next, the added form complexities led to tax-filing issues. We have said all along that one of the major outcomes of ACA is higher complexity levels and corresponding client confusion, and the numbers bear this out.\r\nWhile the total proportion of H&R Block clients whose returns were directly impacted by ACA was similar to the overall tax category, our retail clients sought assistance at a higher rate, which isn't surprising, as our historical experience is that higher tax complexity tends to drive demand for face-to-face professional expertise.\r\nAnd lastly, despite all of the ACA media attention and focus, many tax filers were surprised by the impact on their tax refund, which, in some cases, was very significant. In fact, this refund impact actually altered client-filing behavior as, on average, ACA households went in to file 7 to 10 days later than they had in prior years.\r\nSo after taking a look back, now let let's look forward and talk about the surprising number of changes filers will face as we go into the 2016 tax season. Let's start by talking about important changes in coverage verification notices. As with last year, households who enrolled in a marketplace plan will receive a 1095-A notice in order to reconcile their premium tax credits. We consider this to be a must-have tax document because it's needed to complete the reconciliation process. \r\nBut probably the biggest change in 2016, for most covered households, will be the emergence of a new tax notice, the 1095-B or C. Unlike the 1095-A, the essential purpose of the 1095-B or C is to provide qualified insurance verification with respect to the individual mandate coverage requirement. Because of the added volume, virtually overnight, these insurance coverage notices will become the most common tax-related document households receive, and we expect it there will be lots of questions about them.\r\nThe good news, for preparers like H&R Block, is that the -- in the vast majority of cases, specific inputs from the 1095-B or C will not be required when a client actually files their tax return, provided all the household members are covered. At this point you might be asking, \"Well, okay, but what's going to happen when a filing household doesn't accurately indicate their coverage status, well I have news for you, IRS enforcement is coming. With the advent of 1095-B and C data matching, the IRS now has the ability to cross-reference tax filer's coverage claims.\r\nSimply put, if a filing household indicates coverage, but the IRS has no matched record, the IRS has the ability to send out notices requesting verification of the claim. If no verification is provided, ACA penalties will be applied to the filer's tax account. Additionally, as with last year, the IRS gets monthly data feeds from HHS for households who enrolled in a marketplace plan. This means that the IRS has the real-time ability to hold refunds for those who do not properly file and reconcile using Form 8962.\r\nNow, the IRS typically uses automated mailed notices to inform taxpayers regarding filing inconsistencies and issues, and the same is going to be true for ACA-related notices. In fact, the IRS has provided over a dozen notices that they intend to send out to address the full range of potential ACA-related inconsistencies, all the way from simple math errors to tax collection and refund offset protocols, and we expect millions to be sent later in 2016. Filers will soon learn that the error of tax leniency with respect to ACA is coming to an end.\r\nMoving on to penalty changes. Last tax season, ACA penalties were the higher of $95 per adult or 1% of household income, which as a result translated into an average penalty amount of about $200. This coming tax year, penalties for noncoverage will increase to the higher of $325 per adult or 2% of household income, which practically means that the average household without coverage could face a $400 to $500 hit to their tax refund.\r\nThe implication of this penalty increase will play out in 2 key areas: enrollment and exemptions. As penalty rates increase, the expectation is that households will have higher and higher incentives to get qualified coverage, but the open question is whether the impact of these higher-tax penalties is enough to overcome premium and out-of-pocket affordability issues many households face. But the other really important implication is that the relative value of tax expertise tied to determining a household's eligibility for exemptions will also increase.\r\nNow last year, H&R Block clients who secured an exemption saved an average of about $120. In 2016, we expect the effective value of finding penalty exemptions for eligible clients to exceed the entire cost of an average tax return. Let me repeat that, the dollar value of a found ACA exemption alone will be more than what our filers will pay for a typical assisted tax refund, and these penalties are going to continue to escalate. \r\nFor tax year 2016, non-covered filers will face the higher of 2.5% or almost $700 per adult. Now we are talking about really painful consequences. We expect there to be more reconciliation clients impacted in 2016 as well. As we stated, marketplace-enrolled clients who received premium tax credits must file using Form 8962, and this complexity impact will be experienced by both prior 2014 year enrollees and a whole new group of 2015 marketplace customers. \r\nIn terms of volume, according to the IRS, about 4.5 million filers will be required to reconcile last tax season. We expect that number to approximately double in 2016, because double the number of people enrolled this past year. But you may ask, \"What's the longer-term forecast for marketplace enrollment.\" Well, the general answer is, marketplace enrollment growth will continue, but the rate of that growth is uncertain.\r\nRecall 7 million initially enrolled in 2014, and that number climbed to over 11 million in 2015, with about 85% receiving premium credit tax assistance. HHS' current enrollment estimate for 2016 is in the range of 11 million to 14 million, which reflects a significant slowing of the growth rate due to the combination of factors. The general consensus is that we'll now take up to 5 years to achieve the original CBO estimates of 21 million.\r\nAnd according to the Kaiser Foundation, the likely upper limit of marketplace enrollment is in the range of 20 million to 25 million, with the key drivers being the combined effect of higher penalties and IRS enforcement, coupled with more targeted enrollment marketing. But on the limiting said, there are factors at play that could end up reducing the cap, such as core affordability issues, increased premiums, high churn rates and just increased HHS compliance enforcement.\r\nLast of the changes for 2016 concerns marketplace open enrollment dates, which are shifting yet again. For the 2016 calendar year coverage, open enrollment began on November 1 and will end on January 31. The biggest practical implication for filers who choose to stay uncovered is, after January 31, these clients will not only be faced with a shared responsibility payment for 2015, but they will be essentially locked in to the much higher penalty rates for 2016 as well.\r\nAnd while healthcare.gov has made big strides, the enrollment process continues to be confusing for many in terms of selecting the right plan with the right coverage and deductible levels, as well as ensuring access to preferred doctors, providers and prescription drugs. That's why we're continuing our enrollment services partnership with GoHealth to provide health for any H&R Block clients needing professional enrollment guidance.\r\nSo what does this all mean as we head into 2016 tax season and beyond? I'd like to share some implications and expectations. Let's start with 2016. With millions of new 1095 documents being sent out, we expect there to be lots of consumer confusion, and our tax offices will be ready to address the full range of clients' questions and concerns.\r\nNext, we think higher penalties will be a painful reminder to those who have not acquired qualified coverage. And when combined with increased IRS enforcement, would trigger increased interest in professional expertise around acquiring exemptions, which is another area we are set up well to address client needs.\r\nMany of our ACA clients will experience big tax refund surprises. This represents both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is to address our client's emotional reaction to a reduced refund by clearly demonstrating our efforts to leave no stone unturned in trying to maximize their outcome. The opportunity is to add value by providing personalized advice that puts our clients in a better position to make informed decisions going forward. In overall terms, we expect the volume and magnitude of ACA will continue to broaden and deepen, which means the relative importance of ACA tax expertise will also grow.\r\nNow looking farther in the future, we expect the mix of ACA-related tax forms to shift over time. We expect instances of more complicated reconciliation and exemption forms to grow, while the relative proportion of less-complicated penalty worksheets decreases. This will be driven by increasing marketplace enrollment, higher and higher penalties, vigorous IRS compliance and interest in exemptions expertise. We also expect over time that our volume of ACA-impacted returns will continue to grow over the next 2 to 4 years, from our current 16.4% to between 20% to 25%, depending on how the key drivers play out. This combination of tax form volume and mix changes has the potential to positively impact client growth, retention and revenue.\r\nWe've covered a lot of ground in a short period of time today. We looked at our prior tax season's ACA-related results, we identified major changes for the upcoming tax season and even shared our view of future drivers' impacts and expectations. But there's one thought I'd like to leave you with today, is that we believe we are best positioned to take advantage of the opportunities presented by ACA because of our unique brand assets, our deep tax expertise, the unrivaled investments we've made in our network readiness and the ACA profile of our clients. And that these opportunities will continue to develop over time as the impact of the Affordable Care Act broadens and deepens. Thanks for your time today.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nI always want to hear Mark's point of view on that stuff for me. Anyway, good morning, I'm Greg Macfarlane, and I'm really going to wrap things up here today. So I'll conclude the presentation by providing a financial view on the strategy and topics that were presented in more detail today. Now, I'll do so by focusing on H&R Block's unique role in this industry, with a specific look at the company and the issues impacting our industry. I'll also provide some thoughts about our financial structure and our outlook.\r\nBefore those, however, I'd like to take a moment to review the pass quarter. It's been a busy quarter, and I'll provide some context around the recently completed bank divesture and the changes to our capital structure. First, a few words about our second quarter results, which we released yesterday. As you're likely aware, this is a seasonally slow quarter for us. One in which we report a loss.\r\nRevenues for the quarter decreased by 4.6% to $128 million. While we saw a slight improvement in our off-season result in the United States, these were more than offset by the negative impact of foreign currency rates in Australia and, to a lesser extent, Canada, as we translate those results into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.\r\nTotal operating expenses increased by $43 million, or 13.5%. This increase was expected, resulting primarily from approximately $22 million in transaction costs related to the bank divestiture and capital structure actions, which I'll talk about shortly. Additionally, occupancy costs and amortization expenses increased due to the annualized impact of acquisitions of independent tax preparations -- preparers and in particular, the franchise businesses last year.\r\nAs a result, net loss for the quarter increased 26% to $143 million and a loss per share increased 32% to $0.54 per share. While our losses were higher year-to-date, in a business as seasonal as ours, it's difficult to read too much into the off-season results. As many of you know, tax season performance during our fourth quarter represents a substantial majority of our revenues and earnings for the year. \r\nTurning to discontinued operations. Sand Canyon remains engaged in bulk settlement discussion with the counterparties from which it has received a significant majority of its asserted claims. It's accrual for representation of warranty obligation increased modestly by $4 million to a total of $154 million as of October 31, 2015. Though there is still work ahead and while it will take time, Sand Canyon continues to make progress in its efforts to wind down its remaining obligations.\r\nWith that, let's turn to the divestiture of H&R Block Bank and our capital structure changes. There would be no conversation about the first 1/2 of H&R Block's year if we didn't talk about this more fully, so let me take a few minutes to walk back through a bit of history just for the sake of completeness.\r\nAs we stand here today, H&R Block is no longer in the banking system. We were simultaneously able to enter into a new bank relationship that allows us to offer our bank products going forward to our clients. That then allowed us to go ahead and move forward with announcing our capital structure and making some very specific steps forward in realizing that. Now, I'm not going to spend much time going through the history of the actual application, but I do want to talk a little bit about why were in the banking situation and the value these offer for us.\r\nAt the core basis of our relationship, with hundreds of millions -- excuse me, tens of millions of our clients, is this basic financial transaction that they trust us with that information. And we know that over the years that if we have the right product, the right financial product available to them, we can add value to their lives and make some money too. That need has not changed in this. To recognize that need many years ago, H&R Block decided to start a bank de novo. We chartered the bank, capitalized the bank, and ran that bank very successfully for a number of years. Unfortunately, in the 2008 banking crisis, there were substantial amount of changes that affected all the banks in the banking system, and in particular for H&R Block, H&R Block, Inc., the parent company, was deemed a savings and loan holding company.\r\nThe main implication of that was that we would've been required to build up an additional almost $1 billion of capital to support an overcapitalized bank. We looked at a lot of alternative solutions for us to be able to continue to keep the bank, but be able to meet these compliance rules, but were unable to. And so the natural and formal conclusion we came to is we need to enter the banking system. 620-odd days later, we finally received regulatory approval. And I will not go through those 620 days with you, because I'm through my counseling now. But the point of it is, on October -- excuse me, on August 5th, this summer, we received the go-ahead to go ahead and formalize our transaction and we were able to, in less than a month, close that transaction successfully. The reality is, there was a lot of work to get that done and I'm quite proud of our team that we were able to do that as smooth as possible.\r\nAs we stand here today, we are no longer a savings and loan holding company, and we have successfully transitioned all those operational requirements to our new bank partner, BofI. In fact, as we stand here today, if you went to one of our stores, you could apply for the Emerald Advance preseason loan offered by BofI, and things have gone well so far and we have great expectations for the season and seasons to come, that this is a great relationship for ourselves and for our clients.\r\nThere is a cost, however, to this transaction. And I need to just walk you through very specifically the cost numbers here so that your models are as accurate as possible as you think about H&R Block in the new world. This chart shows you the annual impact and I've broken it down both between revenue and expense, and on the far side, the EBITDA or pretax net income side. In total, on a go-forward basis, you should expect about $36 million to $41 million of negative impact on our EBITDA to this transaction. \r\nThat is broken down to 3 subcomponents. The first and primary one, which is the amount of money that we will owe on our new bank partner, ever season [ph] for doing this transaction. The main basis for that economics is really one around transactions. The more cards we sell, the more the cards are used, the more Emerald Advances, the more refund transfers, they will make more money. We would estimate that between $30 million to $35 million of net cost per year to the company.\r\nThe second cost that we incurred is that during this time frame, we had accumulated a lot of cash and kept some of that money in marketable securities. Those have since been liquidated and sold, and we will no longer receive interest revenue of approximately $6 million per year. The third and final piece is really more just an accounting thing for -- it's more of a technical point, as we're no longer sort of deemed a financial accounting model, we are now going to change the way we recognize some revenue and recharacterize expenses.\r\nAs you notice, there's no net impact to this, but it will decrease our revenue, but the offset will go to expenses. In total, for this tax season, we are guiding you to say this will impact us by about 1 full point on revenue and 1 full point on EBITDA margins. It's important to please update your models.\r\nThis is the cost page. Let me move to the benefit side of this conversation. By selling and transacting our bank, we're now able to be back in control of our balance sheet, and we outlined to you at the beginning of September what our capital structure looked like. The first step was actually redoing our line of credit. We were successfully able to renegotiate a larger line from $1.5 billion to $2 billion, and at the same time, renew it for a 5-year time period. \r\nThe second step was really to go ahead and begin raising some long-term debt, and we actually executed a 2-tranche bond deal early this fall, as you can see the details here. To be honest, I was actually quite pleased with the execution of that, and we're glad we got it done. The third step was really the share repurchase program. Our board authorized us, over the next 4.5 years, to purchase up to $3.5 billion of shares. This covers 4 full tax seasons. We made an initial down payment with a successful tender offer that we completed this fall, where we purchased $1.5 billion worth of our shares at an average price of $37, representing 40.5 million shares. And as you can see at the bottom of the page, as we stand here today, our average shares outstanding are about 236 million. \r\nAnother important point though is more strategic. We have worked very hard to get back to this core business of tax preparation. And we talk about our strategy about being a leading global consumer tax company, our capital structure needs to reflect our business model. And as business people, when you look at this model, there are really, in my mind, 3 unique things to point out. The first is just the cash flow nature that we enjoy here. We have a strong cash flow profile. In fact, from the time at which I transact from a client's perspective and recognize it as revenue to cash collection is either days or weeks.\r\nSecondarily, the amount of capital that we need to reinvest back in the business would be described as modest, when you look at the comp curve with the S&P 500. We are a mature footprint. We have a scale DIY product, and typically that requires about 3% to 4% of annual reinvestment to continue to make that sure it's fresh and contemporary. The third thing, which is a very real issue for H&R Block is this extreme seasonality that we have as part of our model. We are the most seasonal company in the S&P 500, and our capital structure needs to reflect that. The CLOC that we renegotiated at $2 billion, solves that problem.\r\nAnother important point that I want to talk to you about is a little bit more technical, and this is really about our debt capacity. As you know, we've been investment-grade for 60 years, we've reaffirmed our commitment to be an investment grade. For us, it's a technical matter right now. We're BBB stable, Baa3 stable credit. We have quantified what we think investment grade looks for H&R Block, between 2.5 adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA to 3x. And I want to spend a minute actually talking to you about the adjusted growth debt calculation, just to make sure that you all have it straight. \r\nThat calculation is made up of 3 subcomponents, the first is the obvious debt that you can look up on the balance sheet at any point in time. The second factor is following a rating agency convention, where they look at operating leases as a pseudo debt instrument, and they factor that into your debt. So that needs to be taken care of in your calculations. And the third step here is that we are seasonal. And while most of the year we don't have any money outstanding in our CLOC or historically commercial paper, we do borrow quite heavily, for example this time of the year. \r\nAnd the proper way to model that is to take the average for the year, which we're seeing is about $400 million. If you take those numbers, compare it to where we are right now in terms of our adjusted EBITDA, we stand somewhere between 2.2 to 2.5x adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA. So please understand that as you're doing your calculations.\r\nNow, this needs to be put in a broader context. One of the key investment pieces that we have that we think many of you are attracted to is our ability to return cash to you in a very efficient way. And there are 2 primary ways we do that. First, of course, is our dividends; and secondarily, is through our share repurchases. What you're seeing here is our track record since 2010 for those 2 components. What you might not be able to see at the bottom, actually, is we've taken that number in total, the total return of capital, and compared it to what our net income is. And what you're seeing there is for the 2010 to 2013 time frame, we were actually greater than our net income in terms of return to you.\r\nYou can also quite clearly see here in 2014 and '15, the 2-year timeout that we had, because during the saving and loan holding period, we were prohibited from buying back more shares. Now that we've moved past that, we've been back on the train of being able to buy back shares, and you can see an up-to-date chart here on the far right-hand side. This is the 6 months to date, by the way, just for the record. \r\nIn particular though, in this graph, I want to focus on really just the last 4.5 years. And the reason that matters is that's really the time that Bill's been our CEO and our management team has been in place. During that time frame, since May of 2011, we have successfully bought back a quarter of the company. We have raised the dividend by 33%, and we've been able to return a total of $3 billion, which for a market capital, about $9 billion is not a bad track record. We, as a management team, have a good track record in this area.\r\nSo with that, let me take a few minutes to reflect a little bit on some of the themes you've heard today and try to put it into more of a financial context for you. And I want to really start with what I think is the most important point overall, is this is the business we have. We invented this industry 60 years ago. We have been here for the long term and we're going to be here for the long time. And we are 100% committed to being successful in the tax preparation industry. We like this industry. It is slow growth. It is very mature. But it consistently grows somewhere between 1% and 2% of total returns per year, and we understand that. We also like the pricing power this industry has. At H&R Block, we have successfully been able to increase price per year, roughly double the rate of inflation for the last 10 years.\r\nThere are many reasons why pricing is inelastic in this industry, and I've listed a few here for you. The first is taxes are nondiscretionary. I mean, sure, you don't have to file for a couple of years, that's a short-term strategy, you're going to get caught eventually. You have to file your taxes. Secondarily, as an industry, we typically price on complexity. So for those of you that go to a CPA, the number of hours they spent on your account will correlate to how much they charge you, which is approximately for complexity. In our business, we typically look at the forms we need to fill in for you and how complicated those forms are to actually train, to execute, and the risks that's involved in those. \r\nThe third, and perhaps most important reason we have pricing power is, the majority of Americans receive this very big refund, $2,500, $3,000, $3,500. And when you look at the average charge that we pay them in the $200 range, that's a good investment of their money, to get it done right, to make sure they have peace of mind. We like the pricing in this industry. We also, importantly, know more about this industry than anybody. If you actually think about the years that we've been around, the amount of data that we've collected, the number of experiences that we've been involved in, we have this knowledge base that is a very powerful way for us to understand things. And as you -- as we move forward here strategically, we're going to take more and more advantage of that. And you saw some examples of that today through Laura Scobie's presentation. \r\nThe other implicit part of our strategy is now that we're back to this basic tax preparation company is, this is all we've got. We have no distractions with other industries. We are only about tax and we are going to live and die based on how successful we are in this industry. Importantly, we're the only company that says, \"If you want to do your taxes your way, we are here for you.\" If you want to sit at home in your pajamas late at night and just do it yourself, we're going to have a great product for you. If, on the other hand, you want somebody to sit next to you and go line-by-line and explain every aspect of your taxes with you, we've got people for you, too. And as you can imagine, there're many shades of gray between those 2 extremes, and H&R Block is really the only company that can deliver that. \r\nThis is a large industry. It's $20 billion in total. And as you can see here from the graph, we're the largest participant in the industry. But you can also see that we have room to grow here. What you've seen from us today is an articulation of the strategy that says we now have an answer and a plan to deal with independence. We also now have a plan and an approach to CPAs. And of course, we always worry about our assisted competitors and our DIY-branded competitors. We believe, over the next several years, that we will continue to grow a larger share of this market. \r\nThe other important part of our model is we are a medium and long-term thinking management team. We are here for the long term. This is the way we make decisions. The average American starts filing at age 18, 19 or 20. They then file for an additional 60 years or so, and H&R Block wants to be considered every year along that journey, that's an important part of our strategy.\r\nNow with that, let me spend a few minutes talking more about what we at Block think are some of our competitive differentiators and our sustainable competitive advantages, and that really starts with our brand. If you think about H&R Block, this is a ubiquitous term, it means taxes. In fact, 96% of Americans know exactly who we are. And when you ask them who we are, they would say things like taxes, trust and expertise, exactly what we want.\r\nAnd that's a direct result of decades of experience doing hundred millions of returns and spending hundreds of millions of dollars on our brand. Any competitor that comes into the tax space is going to have to fight this brand. And if you think about this, in fact you heard Jason talk about it, this is going to be a source for growth to us in the DIY, because awareness is still not at the 96% there. And there's a strong correlation between awareness and DIY and our ability to grow successfully in the future.\r\nThe next advantage is we have money to make things happen. Our first priority, of course, is to make sure that we invest from a CapEx and expense basis back into this core profitable business, and we're doing that. The second priority for us, of course, is to invest in what we call strategic initiatives. And you saw some examples of that today with our DIY investment, you saw that with our Block Advisors, you saw that with our health care ACA investments. This is an important part of our ability to be more relevant and to grow market share over time.\r\nNow the nice thing about H&R Block is even after we finish investing in these 2 areas, we always have cash left over in terms of supporting the dividend and at times, of course, being able to return additional capital to you. This is a nice business model.\r\nNext is our distribution. We are pervasive. If you cannot go onto the Internet and you cannot go into a distribution in terms of where software is available, you cannot go anywhere in the country where you won't be able to find H&R Block. This is a very real competitive issue in this industry because you're always going to have to compete against H&R Block. Today, you heard a new expression of this distribution strategy really around Block Advisors. The clients that we're focusing on here are clients that we've got familiarity with, and they've got familiarity with you -- with us through our H&R Block Premium experience. \r\nThe reality is that we did not pay as much attention to this over the last several years. That's changed, and you heard Laura talk very specifically about some of the exciting ideas that are going on there. We are focused on winning here in the medium and long term. Importantly, from my perspective, in terms of financial model, the cost that we will be incurring for CapEx and expenses to support this program are in all of our current guidance for you, so there'd be no additional expenses or CapEx required to help this transition. But, also importantly, this is not a 1-year solution for us, we are committed to this. And success for this case will be measured over the medium and long term.\r\nNext, I want to spend a few minutes talking more broadly about the industry and some of our thoughts on them -- on these issues. First of all, we talked to you about 3 different forms of fraud happening in this industry at a great level of detail. We think it's important as investors in this company to understand this very macro issue. Our view is that there's a lot of overlap between them. Quality and fraud are a growing issue in this industry and it's distorting the results. It's also creating an unleveled playing field for companies like Block that play by the rules. \r\nOur view is that this will be fixed over time. Standards are inevitable. It's just common sense. I cannot, however, look at you and say this will be fixed in one year. But if you're a medium and long-term investor and you look at the realities and the facts of the situation, I hope that you conclude, as we have, that this is inevitably going to be fixed, and Block will be a key part of getting that done.\r\nThe next major thing we talked about really is the strategic change in the DIY space. As many of you know, historically, there's been a value segment that has a value product and a value price. There has been, on contrast to that, a premium segment that has a premium product and a premium price. And what's happened here in the last 2 years, is the premium product provider has basically pushed pricing down to the point where the value players who don't have a good-enough product will not -- no longer be to compete for those value people. And we think as time goes on here, in the next few years, these smaller competitors in the DIY space will get squeezed out of the industry. Their product will not be able to keep up with what's being offered by the market leaders here. And we believe that H&R Block is very well positioned to take advantage of this change.\r\nThe next topic really is one of health care. And we've talked to you a lot about health care. We're very interested in health care. The ACA was the biggest change to the tax code since Ronald Reagan was president in the 1980s. This is a big deal for our industry. And what I want you to take away from this is that, in particular, at Block we feel like we're the best people to provide solutions for taxpayers. We have a lot of strengths in this area, and it's an area that we're investing money in and will continue to invest money in. But make no mistake about it, this is not a 1-year opportunity, this is a multiyear opportunity. And the reason why is because it deals with people's behavior. And the reality is it's hard to understand how people's behavior is going to change. Things are changing already, there'll be more this year and there'll be more in years to come. \r\nOne question I do get a lot from you is, \"Can you help me to quantify this?\" I don't have all the answers for you, but I want to provide you a bit more of a structure to think about as you continue to reflect on ACA and H&R Block. When we talk about a client being impacted by ACA, there's only 1 of 3 ways they get impacted from our perspective. The first is they actually chose through the health care exchange to buy a policy. At the end of that year, they now have to do a new reconciliation form. Okay? That's a premium tax credit reconciliation on this chart. \r\nThe second situation is an individual who should've gotten health care chose not to, and they now have to pay a penalty. Those people, when they do their taxes, have to fill in a new worksheet or series of worksheets. The third category is that person who will be subject to a penalty, but because of their circumstances, may be eligible for a partial or full exemption. They also have new forms to fill in during the tax event. This bar chart that's on this page is actually proportionately accurate for how those 3 categories broke down last year using IRS data.\r\nAs we go forward in the future, these things will change, what we'll find is less people will be subject to the penalty, more people will be applying and getting exemptions for part or all of the year. And of course, more people will be getting health care, and therefore, then have to fill in a premium tax credit reconciliation. Why does this matter? Well, this is mix. And if you remember the way we charge is based on complexity. The more complex the work we do, the more we charge. And from bottom to top, we charge more money. This is a mix-based pricing opportunity for us. The proportions on the right-hand side are directional, by the way, not completely forecasting accurate.\r\nThe next phenomena that I would say is working in our favor, is really what I would call the unit side of things. Last year, 16.4% of our clients were impacted 1 of the 3 ways that we talked about in the previous page, and we expect over the next few years that number will be 20% to 25%, representing more economic opportunity for H&R Block to make money.\r\nThere are other economic opportunities available, but these are 2 primary ones that we talk about. So hopefully, that's a little bit helpful for you. Moving on, I do want to talk a little bit more financially for you. And that conversation for me always starts on the top line, really about revenue. A successful H&R Block is a Block that actually is showing growth in the 4 primary drivers of revenue. We're seeing price, we're getting reasonable volume, we're seeing a reasonable mix, and we're able to attach products onto that.\r\nSo let me spend a few minutes giving you my perspective, really on last year and some of our thoughts going forward. Prices have very real opportunity in this industry. I talked to you about the fact that we have low elasticity. We have spent a lot of time understanding the data behind that and turning price into more of a tactical, historical solution for Block into one that's more strategic. And we're very pleased with our results in pricing and expect pricing opportunities to continue to be available to us.\r\nIn terms of volume, we are not happy with our volume results. What we have though done, is clarify what the issue is. We are not winning the early season EIC and we're embarked on a multiyear journey to fix that problem and you heard some of our plans today from Laura, and it's an overall theme as a management group that we're very focused on.\r\nIf you set that aside, however, we are actually okay with our volume results. We can always do more. But the reality is, that if it wasn't for that one group of people, we would be okay with our volume. In terms of mix, as a company and as an industry, we have done a bad job educating U.S. investors on what mix matters, okay? Let me give you a simple example. We know, with a high degree of probability, that an EZ filer will continue to be an EZ filer for the next several years. We present value that relationship back, include the additional products we might sell them, include their propensity to take ACA and look at them as a lifetime value. \r\nThen you do that same type of math with someone who's more of a 1040, like many of you people in the audience. The difference in lifetime value between those 2 clients are magnitude differently. We're talking more than 10x. And we, at Block have spent a lot more time to understand what that math looks like, to understand what we can do and where our strengths are, and to change some of the way we communicate and hold people in terms of behavior in the field. We're doing okay in mix in our perspective.\r\nThe fourth category, really, is one of attach. We talk about this as our Tax Plus strategy. And here, the 2 main variables, of course, are getting more products available. As an example, last year, we offered Tax Identity Shield, which is a new product to the industry, an example of H&R Block's innovation. And frankly, were very pleased with first year results, and expect that product to continue to be more and more relevant. The second thing we focus on attach, of course, is our existing 5 products that we have, can we sell them to our clients? And if you look over the last 3 years, we had a good track record of being more and more relevant for more clients, and we expect these trends to continue.\r\nNext, I want to talk a little bit about EBITDA. At H&R Block, we start with approximately $3 billion of revenue per year and we turn that into almost $1 billion of EBITDA. It's a fairly remarkable business model. On a percentage basis, you can see over the last several years that we've operated in the low 30% range. As a matter of guidance, we basically indicate we expect Block to continue to be in the 28% to 32% range. Just for contrast and comparison sake, I'm showing you here what the average S&P 500 company is. We're a very profitable company. \r\nThe next I really want to talk about is capital. Now, we talk about a CapEx range of being somewhere between 3% to 4% of revenues per year. And as you can see -- you may not be able to see, but that last dot is what our guidance is for this year. I'll get -- at the end, I'll confirm all that for you. But we expect to be within that 3% to 4% range. We were elevated for 1 year in 2014, which was really making up for some previous years prior to 2011, and so -- where we were underinvesting in the business model. \r\nThis is the cash view. When you now turn to more of an accounting view and talk about depreciation and amortization, there's a normal time lag. So what I'm showing you here at the top of the page now is how depreciation and amortization is behaving. As expected, as you increase from 12, 13, and 14-year CapEx, that then takes time to come through depreciation and amortization line, which is kind of what you're seeing here. But I want to be clear with you, it's not the only reason depreciation and amortization is going up. So what I'm going to do for you now is break down depreciation and amortization into the subcomponent parts.\r\nAs you would expect, the main driver of depreciation and amortization is CapEx, which is the bottom larger bar. Normally, we have a program where we have 50 people whose job it is to go out and actually look at independents to buy them. And the way that gets accounted for is part of the purchase price we pay for them is capitalized and then amortized over time. And if you notice that sort of that middle, that green bar, independent acquisitions, and that reflects a normal $35 million to $45 million of investment that we make in those. Very stable, doesn't change too much.\r\nThe one thing you'll notice in 2014 and very pronounced in '15 and we're sure will be in '16, is this onetime opportunity that we had to buy back a bunch of our franchisees that had been sold several years back. That program is going to actually wrap up the year, and I'll be a bit more specific on that later on.\r\nWhile I'm talking here about independents and franchisees, let me reflect a bit more strategically on this. We do have a team of people whose job it is to go out and find competitors that may make sense to come into H&R Block's family. Several years ago, management's decision was to sell a number of prime H&R Block territories to become franchise territories. The 2 basic strategies behind that were: One, we think they actually operate the stores better than Block can. There's no evidence to support that before, after and during that time frame.\r\nThe second strategy, of course, was to generate a quick gain on sale. We went back and looked at that program and made the strategic decision to go back after those 600 stores, which we started last year and will complete this year. Last year, in fact, we bought back 340 stores. This year will be about 260. At the end of this year, we're pretty finish with that program. Once we finish that program, however, we will continue to do what we've always done, which is to look for quality independents to bring them into the H&R Block family to the tune of $35 million to $45 million per year. Importantly, in both cases, when we do the math on it, I'll give you a simple example, we're able to buy them at compelling financial returns. H&R Block trades at roughly 10x EBITDA, ballpark. When I buy back these independents, when I buy back these franchisees, I'm typically paying somewhere between 2x to 3x earnings. The moment at which that transaction closes, I'm able to create financial arbitrage that benefits you as an investor. \r\nNext I want to talk about our efficiency of investment. The reality is if we use return on equity, given our recapitalization, we're now pretty much at [indiscernible] so we prefer to talk about return on invested capital. This is a number -- or this is a metric that we think is actually very relevant. Now as you can see, our history was one that we weren't paying attention to up until a few years ago, but we've been successfully able to move our return on invested capital to the mid-20s. What I'm not showing you here, though, is under the new world with the recapitalization and things to come, what it will look like. But I will tell you, you'll find us go to the mid-30s here very quickly. What's even more impressive, when you compare that to our cost of capital, the line at the bottom, for every dollar of equity and debt that we're given, we're able to basically generate a 2x to 3x return on that. So very strong ROIC. \r\nNext, income taxes. Now for those of you that are -- have been here multi-years, the normal conversation for income taxes is we give you what we think the tax rate will be for this year. Well, this year we're going to do it differently, we'll actually give you forward-looking guidance on tax rates. I joined H&R Block in 2012 and when you look back at what our tax rate was for many years before that, what you saw was effectively Block paying at the high end of the corporate tax rate at approximately 40%. The other thing that many of you may not know is that we at Block actually had real issues with how we accounted for. We had controllership and compliance issues in our income tax area. \r\nIf you roll the clock forward to today, what you've seen is we've been able to materially drop our tax rate by a full 5 points as well as fix all the compliance and controllership issues. This change, itself, just the tax rate over the last 3 years has generated $100 million of cash savings for the company, which is part of what was refunded back through the share repurchase program earlier this year. \r\nNow going forward, as we look through our next several years and where we think we're going to be at, I want to provide you guidance that we think our expected base tax rate will be 35% to 36%. So please update your models to reflect that. \r\nSo moving on. I now want to give you actually a bit more specifics on the outlook, and these are more of the modeling-type questions many of you are looking forward to. So starting with really just the broader view of what we think returns will be, no news. We think it'll continue to be about 1% to 2% growth in total returns in the United States, both for this year and as we look out over the next 3 years. There will be some differences between assisted and DIY, really with the DIY continuing to benefit from really the tail end of the pen-and-paper filers that are converting over to DIY. That will moderate and we will expect the DIY to actually slow down. \r\nNow specific to H&R Block, I went through a slide before with you, but I want to reinforce this very important impact from the bank divestiture that we completed earlier this year. This year, our revenues will be impacted by negative 1% because of the bank transaction. It will also impact EBITDA by 1 full point. And because that's an annual cost, that will go forward for the foreseeable future. \r\nNext, we have incurred onetime costs, as you would expect, to transact both the bank and our recapitalization. Most of that cost, by the way, was recognized in the second quarter, but it'll be a small amount here for rest of the year. But in total, we expect those onetime costs to be about $22 million. They're one time; they will not reoccur next year or the years out. \r\nNext is foreign exchange. It's a reality that every company with international operations is facing right now. As it stands here today when we look at the Canadian dollar and the Austrian dollar, it will impact my reported revenues by 1% this year and will have a much smaller impact on earnings, but it will be about a $0.01 of earnings this year. We do not forecast foreign exchange rates and so therefore I'm not going to be able to give you a 3-year expectation of what that looks like. This is just accounting, but it's a real issue. \r\nNext are compensation and benefits expenses. As many of you know, last year, we actually increased our compensation and benefit, specifically training, to include the costs for rolling out the ACA, the health care strategy that you heard from Mark. And we also, last year, incurred some costs because we introduced a new system in our tax stores that actually drives the tax interview. That was successfully completed. And so those costs would actually come back down this year and they are. Offsetting that, however, is with us buying back a lot of these franchisees, we're bringing those staff on now full-time year around and therefore our C&B costs, our compensation and benefits costs, will be up. If you put that aside, all you're going to see there for this year and the years out really is more inflationary. And we've done a good job controlling our C&B costs over the last several years. \r\nNext is our adjusted EBITDA margins. Our margins this year are expected to be 29% to 30%, really exclusively because of the things that were listed above here. As we go out into the future, we'll continue to guide to 28% to 32%. That is not a forever statement, that's a short-term and medium-term guidance on what we think EBITDA margins should be for H&R Block. \r\nNext is interest expense. We successfully completed a $1 billion bond deal earlier this year. We're also now utilizing our CLOC and so that will be interest expense between $66 million to $69 million this year. There is no forward-looking guidance in here or for the 3 years about when and how much we would do additional debt raises. This is simply reflective of the debt that we've done to year as well as our seasonal liquidity interest costs. \r\nMoving on. In terms of CapEx, we'll continue to guide between 3% to 4% of revenues for this year and for the next 3 years. In terms of A&D/franchise buybacks, the program that we embarked last year in buying back our franchise partners is basically winding down, so that program will finish. But this year, with the completion of additional 260 of those offices, plus our normal level of independent acquisitions, we expect to spend somewhere between $90 million and $100 million and then we would typically then go back to a more normal range, which would be $35 million to $45 million in the years following. \r\nNext, in terms of depreciation and amortization, we expect to incur somewhere between $175 million and $180 million this year. And as you can see, I've broken it down into the subcomponents. I'm not going to get into that right now, however. In terms of the next 3 years, really because of the way that D&A lags the cash expenditure, we would expect it to continue to be elevated at $180 million to $195 million. \r\nNext. In terms of our tax rate, I did give you the 3-year-plus expectation where the base rates were between 35% and 36%, but for this year, because of some continued onetime opportunities, we expect taxes to be somewhere between 33% and 34%. So that may be something else you want to adjust in your models. \r\nAnd then next, in terms of our average diluted shares outstanding. Right now, we're expecting 250 million to 250 million (sic) [ 250 million to 255 million ] of weighted shares outstanding for the year. But as you know, as a primary practice of ours, we don't give forward-looking guidance on share repurchases. So we're not saying whether we will or we won't, but this is kind of where we stand right now. So hopefully, that's helpful. \r\nThis is really the summary of our presentation for you. Many of you are familiar with the overall investment thesis, but what you've seen today hopefully is an articulation at a more level of detail about the excitement and the opportunities that H&R Block has available to us. We think that H&R Block represents both a greater growth opportunity as well as a very compelling value opportunity for you. \r\nSo thank you all for coming. Thank you for your time today. Give us a few minutes and then we'll be able to do Q&A session with you all. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text3": "Before we take questions, one quick ask. If you all could please state your name and your company, just for the transcript purposes, when we get the mic to you. We have a couple of runners with the mics and please stating your question into the microphone would be great. So starting there with George.\n\n---\n\nGeorge Tong with Piper Jaffray. I want to talk with EITC fraud. It accounted for about 2/3 of the volume decline last year in the assisted business, so clearly an important part of the business. Bill, can you talk about how the conversations are going with legislators, with the IRS in terms of addressing the fraud? How much you expect the fraud to slow in the coming years? And what additional steps need to be taken?\n\n---\n\nYes, so -- and then Kathy, if you want to add anything after I try to answer George's question. The conversations, I mean, there is clear recognition that for this program to sustain, and there is support for the EITC program generally on both sides of the aisle. But that $14 billion to $17 billion in the last year of, call it, as Kathy said, improper payments for fraud, is not sustainable. When you have 25% of the payments going out that are improper, something needs to be done about that. So there's great recognition on that. There's clear understanding now that the disparity between the documentation requirements between DIY and assisted is not -- doesn't makes sense. So that's why, for this year, the number of questions has been reduced for paid preparers. And then as Kathy indicated, there's a pilot going on, which ourselves and a few other DIY preparers are participating in with the intent that, in '17, the following tax season, we would have parity along those lines. So that is proceeding quite well. Again, we're working with the -- there's always a misbelief that the IRS controls everything. IRS basically takes their direction from the Treasury. So there is real understanding with the Treasury -- I've talked to the highest levels of the Treasury and the IRS, that this is the way forward. So I'm very pleased -- sometimes people will say, why are you guys -- you'll never get anything done with the government, et cetera. Well, Kathy and Marie van Luling and the whole GR team works really hard on this. So we have made some real progress on that. How this translates to how much of the fraud will decline, hard to say. It's difficult for us to really forecast that that will lead to X, Y or Z. The public-private partnership that Kathy referenced where we're doing a lot of things, which is more around SERF, but really impacts EITC because all of this stuff is tied together, are ways forward. So we've got real change on the documentation requirements. We have a public-private partner. We've all signed a memorandum of understanding, all the names you know in the DIY space. So I do think the ball is being advanced. But I think Kathy said at the end, is it going to stop fraud, no, but I think we are moving along. So I'm pleased that we're making -- this is part of the job is really to try to impact this. Is there anything else you want to add just...\n\n---\n\nI think you really captured it. We're in great shape for the progress that we've made for 2016, really pleased with the pilot and the changes in the audit questions. And then for 2017, we're really looking to see those form changes for consistency across the filing channels and then the additional legislation that the IRS is pushing for. And with all that, I think we'll definitely see more progress in that area.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Scott?\n\n---\n\nScott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. First, I'd like to start, you guys typically do not provide a revenue guidance and there is a lot of guidance here and it's appreciated. Could you just speak to the top line a little bit outside of these puts and takes, but how you think about it perhaps in this year, if you want to share, and then again longer term?\n\n---\n\nYes, I'll let Greg address that. And again, Scott, I think Greg will, I think, reiterate what he said earlier about the 4 components of revenue with -- go ahead, Greg.\n\n---\n\nYes, we try to provide you with things that we think will be meaningful for you. I mean, I know it's always a question where people want more. But the reality is when you go into a tax season, when you look at even our internal models, we've got sort of lots of champion-challenger models. There's still a fair amount of -- even coming down to the last week, and so that's partly why we don't do it. But there's also a portion of why we don't do it is because the reality is that we are the industry leaders and a lot of competitors' strategy is to copy what we do and so we don't want to make it easy for them. But in terms of our ideas about revenue, it really is those 4 drivers: it's price, it's volume, it's mix and it's attach. We feel good about 3 of the 4, but the reality is, for us to be successful, it's got to be 4 of the 4 moving together. These are things that take time. These are things we're optimistic about. We're continuing to make investments smartly into a number of programs that will drive that. But when you only really have a chance to do business once a year, progress is measured over time and that's just a reality for our business. That's kind of our high-level thoughts on it, Scott.\n\n---\n\nI appreciate that. And just a similar question, different category. In return of capital, just your thoughts on what you're going to do with the dividend longer term. And also have you been buying back stock since the tender? And I know you're not going to forecast that, and I haven't done the math of what's implied in this year's share count guidance. But just thoughts on those two, dividend, and then what's the ongoing plan with the repurchases?\n\n---\n\nYes, so let me start with the dividend. I mean, as you all know, we've been paying a dividend for 50-plus years. It's something we take very seriously. We did increase it, but the increase was actually 3-plus years ago. We were prohibited also during the time we were a savings and loan holding company from increasing the dividend. We did ask, but we were prohibited from doing that. We have chosen not to yet clarify dividend policy for a number of reasons, the main one is that we had a lot of other things we wanted to get out of the way. We understand, as a company, this is one of the things that we can do to create value for us. So you'd expect sometime in the near future for us to have a more specific articulation of dividend policy. As it relates in the share repurchase, we bought back 1.5 billion of shares, it was a very material execution for us.\n\n---\n\n$1.5 billion.\n\n---\n\nSorry, $1.5 billion. Thank you, Bill. So soon, I forget. So we completed successfully $1.5 billion and the reality is that that was a very big step forward. There were a lot of things that were moving. Since then, we've not bought back shares. To be very clear, we're very happy at buying them back at $37. But the way we think about share repurchase is opportunistic, and we think about creating medium- and long-term value. And we want the historic record to reflect that we were very smart on how we bought those shares back on your behalf. Part of which you heard from us in our articulation is, over the years we think we've done a good job at that, so let us do our jobs here for you. We have $2 billion of remaining authorization. We have some time to work with, but we're also going to be smart about how we do that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Let's go with Anj and then Gil and then Kartik.\n\n---\n\nAnj Singh from Crédit Suisse. Really appreciate all the color and transparency that you guys gave around ACA, EITC, fraud and even the financial outlook. But wanted to get a little bit more color on the ACA opportunity as we think about it longer term. You guys said 16.4% of your clients were impacted, 16.6% for the overall market. Could you, I guess, get into why are you still trailing the market in that category. And also I'd be interested to see how much of your ACA impacted mix is DIY versus assisted. And do you have a sense of how much of the market is DIY versus assisted in that ACA-impacted category?\n\n---\n\nSo let me just understand trail. When you say trailing in the market, I just want to understand what do you mean by...\n\n---\n\nSo you have slightly lower...\n\n---\n\n16.6% versus 16.4%.\n\n---\n\nYes, it's slightly lower.\n\n---\n\nOh, okay, okay, okay. You guys want to take that?\n\n---\n\nGo ahead, Mark.\n\n---\n\nSo first of all, I'm just going to say, generally, this is going to take time to play out. We don't believe that there's a material difference between ourselves in the category. One of the -- probably what would account for that biggest change this year, as you saw, a lot of exemptions are being done in the DIY space, and so that's part of the explanation of what's going on, at least in this current year results. If not for that, we would be at or above. I also indicated that on our assisted side, a significantly larger percentage of our retail clients are -- were the ACA impacted and that's going to begin to play out at a greater degree going forward. But it's going to be a long term kind of -- we gave you a little bit of a sense of where we think we're headed ultimately, but it's going to take a number of years for this to play out, we've always said that. And we believe that over time, as Greg said, that the mix of that impact will change over time. More complicated reconciliation and exemption clients, fewer penalty clients will be impacted. So there's both a volume and a mix impact.\n\n---\n\nI will say that from last season, more sort of broadly as management, we were very pleased with how ACA went from Block's perspective. We were really looking at the client experience because the reality is it was a lot of education that we had to provide to our tax professionals through all the changes to our DIY experience, and we looked very carefully at the client experience from that. And we also compared ourselves to a lot of the competition out there, and the reality is, there was a lot of very poor execution by other companies out there. And we think over time that will matter because this is a very real issue for people. As Mark said, the penalties are very real here. The notices are going to start coming. People will have to sit down and account for their decisions as it relates to their taxes, but also for their health care. And that's why, for us, it wasn't so much about the numbers last year, it was about our execution and we were very pleased with that. Yes, Gil.\n\n---\n\nWe had a very -- you had a very interesting discussion about...\n\n---\n\nJust say -- I know who you are, but say your name first.\n\n---\n\nGil Luria, Wedbush Securities. We had a very interesting conversation about identity fraud and you don't have the numbers for this last season, but based on anecdotal evidence, it went from $3 million a couple of years ago, maybe double in the last couple of years. That's a very big number. Assuming that's all online and digital, I'm assuming there's very little of that happening in the stores. Do you think the steps this year will be effective enough to either reduce that number or reduce those growth rates? And then if it does, per the charts that you put up there, there is still a gap between the rejection -- you file rejection rates online versus in-stores. So wouldn't that impact your digital business somewhat? Your competitor from Mountain View has talked about the fact that yes, it would impact them if there was less fraud, but it would impact everybody. Wouldn't you be concerned that if that particular line, that you'd have some impact from the fraud declining?\n\n---\n\nSo yes, about 3 questions in there. So let me try to carve it up. One is you're correct, the IRS commissioner himself acknowledges that, still on identity refund fraud, it's virtually all DIY. So it is not an assisted issue for any assisted preparer. It's really a digital preparer. Now when it comes to the volume piece, I guess, Jason, you should take that. And then your middle question was, I think, more for Kathy, was you wanted to know the -- would that affect our volume if everything went down?\n\n---\n\nDo you expected the decline or just slow growth and then if it does decline or slow growth, wouldn't that impact the digital line?\n\n---\n\nJason, you want to take that?\n\n---\n\nWell, so what I showed as far as our own reject rates, there is a difference between assisted and DIY because for a do-it-yourself user, as I mentioned, they're really confident in their preparation skills, but that doesn't mean that they're very good at it. So we would always expect the difference between assisted and DIY, there to be a gap or potentially double. Our rates, when we look at it -- we're always trying to improve our reject rate and I think that we're making progress. But as I mentioned, there are -- there's a wide disparity in the reject rates among competitors and the tax software industry and I think that you see those rates and how they correlate to e-file growth. As those come down, what I think that you'll see is competitors in the industry looking more like H&R Block tax offers. I think our own tax offer, I think we have opportunity, but I do think that it will affect other competitors going forward.\n\n---\n\nThen a question on Block Advisors. Do you feel you have the appropriate staffing? Or are you going to need to hire CPAs or fold in other CPA practices in order to deliver the Block Advisors and extend the brand? And then Bill and Greg have worked really hard over the last few years to get out of all the ancillary business and you put up a slide that says you're getting into payroll and bookkeeping. Is there a slippery slope there that extends you into far-field businesses that after all that hard work of getting into it, how many -- 600 and how many days, Greg?\n\n---\n\nYes, all right. So let me take both of those, and Laura, if you want to add anything. So for this year, it's essentially a transition, translation of what was formally H&R Block Premium to Block Advisors. So we have staff in place already, and these are -- as part of H&R Block Premium, these are among our most experienced and knowledgeable. The H&R Block Premium team has always dealt with more sophisticated tax clients. We think that we can build a brand here that would involve having to train and potentially be able to absorb more CPAs, so that, in the long run, you're in the right zone. But in terms of for this particular tax season, we feel very confident that we have the staff to handle that and we have obviously recruited more. And we think that we're going to be able to attract more people to a brand like this that might be more for CPAs or independents serving that kind of clientele to really impact that -- to want to seek to be part of Block Advisors. So we feel good about that. Now with regard to the payroll in that regard, I would caution you not to go too far because we have a business services Package today. We have an ability to serve clients on their business returns, both tax, et cetera. This is a small movement out. We're testing it. I don't see it as a slippery slope at all. I see it as a natural extension of what a more sophisticated client would want. As Laura said earlier, about 1 in 5 in our research are small business owners, so we want to be able to serve them on what I would call -- and this is small -- when we're talking small business, we're talking everyone from self-employed to a few employees. So that's -- I think it's in pretty close here. It's more of a bookkeeping play. That's what I would say.\n\n---\n\nJust keep in mind, Gil, offering doesn't mean that we're actually doing it right, so we typically are leveraging partnerships to do a lot of that.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nSo then last one, for you, Greg. You talked about the cost of the [indiscernible] being 1 point of EBITDA margin and that's the extent of reduction in EBITDA that you have from last year to this year. What about operating leverage? To the extent that you get revenue and you're getting very high incremental rates, when do we start seeing the operating leverage on that?\n\n---\n\nSo if you think top-down about our business model and the way our costs behave, we tend to be kind of a mix between fixed costs and variable costs. The main variable cost we incur, there're really 2 forms, and one is on the assisted side, the tax professional's variable comp, okay. But that represents for the next dollar of revenue, about 1/3 of that goes in their pocket, and after that, once you've paid for fixed costs, its margin. On the DIY side, it's really actually the marketing dollars because those actually are quite variable and we push those up and so, there's also the next dollar of revenue, there's something less than 50% that goes up into our variable costs. When we model all that out, you include things like wage inflation and rent inflation in that, we would typically hit our fixed costs inflection point at about 3.5% of revenue growth. There are some, depends on what the revenue is, but for all intents and purposes. So as we're able to get to 4%, you then would have a natural impact on your margin percentage expansion. So as I've said to many of you over the years, Block is able to successfully get to 4-plus percent of revenue will naturally be EBITDA margin expansion and so that's what we're focused on, is getting to that fixed cost leverage point.\n\n---\n\nLet's go to Kartik in the third row.\n\n---\n\nKartik on the aisle.\n\n---\n\nYou talked a lot about EITC and maybe the processes that are going to take place over the next couple of years. But as you look at this tax season, is there another headwind you're anticipating because of EITC at least for the retail business, and if so, what would you -- how would you quantify that?\n\n---\n\nAnother -- I don't know. No, I don’t see...\n\n---\n\nNo, I mean, for example, 2 years ago we decided to eliminate the free EZ program. That had an initial 1-year impact. Last year was sort of the echo effect, that's not going to recur this year. But really there's nothing that I would -- that jumped to my mind unless Bill's got something I've forgotten about.\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nWell, I thought last year, you said 2/3 of the clients that you didn't retain were because of EITC that migrated away from retail to digital. So you don't expect that to happen this year? You don’t expect any type of migration from retail to digital on the EITC side?\n\n---\n\nNo, I don't think we -- I thought you meant for a new -- I think until we get real parity, real -- I think that that possibility, we're going to work hard, we've got a lot of programs against that, but that -- the trend on that would, at this point, probably continue. The question is how deep? Will it be as extensive as past seasons? I'm not going to forecast any of that. But that would be a continuing issue because we don't have documentation requirements at parity. There's still all the stuff that Kathy talked about with regard to the fraud piece. There's still 25% impact. That doesn't flip in a year. I think we're making some strides, but -- so that will be -- I guess, you could term that a continuation.\n\n---\n\nJust to be clear, Kartik, we never said that all of them went to digital. Some of them went to digital, some of them went to other assisted competitors, yes.\n\n---\n\nYes. And then, Jason, just for you. You showed the products you're going to have on digital and what your competitors are doing. Does this mean you don't anticipate having an absolute 0 product or a product that has no cost for federal and no cost for state, and no cost a financial product?\n\n---\n\nThanks for your question, Kartik, but I'm not going to comment on any pricing or promotion that we might offer in the upcoming season.\n\n---\n\nYou'll find out soon.\n\n---\n\nCould we go back to Thomas Allen back there.\n\n---\n\nThomas, we'll try to get you a better seat next year, okay?\n\n---\n\nIf you guys can please just state your name and company.\n\n---\n\nThomas Allen, Morgan Stanley. So 3 initiatives you guys are doing, buying back the franchisees and buying independents is the first. Second one is obviously all your investments are in the Affordable Care Act. Third one is switching from the Premium to Block Advisors. Can you just talk about kind of the investment period? For example, I think you invested heavily in ACA last year and then when do you start to see these be tailwinds rather than headwinds?\n\n---\n\nYes, so let's take them one at a more time. I think, as Greg said, we've made a big investment on the A&D side, especially on the franchise buybacks, we will have completed 600 in 2 years, 600 buybacks. It has moved the mix to 65-35. As Greg said, and I said in my opening, compelling returns. We're buying these really well. But they do increase our expense base, especially in off-quarters like you saw here. So I think that that -- we're near the end of the runway or at the end of the runway on the franchise buybacks. We'll continue to look at independents. So that -- and obviously, when we look at independents with the stuff that Kathy talked about, we have to make sure we're buying somebody that we think can fit our ethics, our accuracy, et cetera. Then on ACA, big increase last -- or big investment last year in training and marketing. We think we're going to be able to realize that. We think we did a great job with our tax pros. The refresher training is much more limited, as Greg pointed out. So we actually think we're going to start to reap the benefits of that investment from last year and being the place to go for ACA. The third area was Block Advisors. Okay, so I think that, we're going to see how this plays out. We did convert 300 offices. We want to see how this plays out. Our plans are in the, longer term, that this fits within our capital structure and our expense structure as we said. The offices will be profitable this year because they are essentially going concerns, so I think we'll be able to realize that. We're not indicating levels or amounts or anything like that, but we feel good about the transition. I know our tax pros that are in the office are very excited about it. In various markets, you can stop in and see them. There're a couple here in New York that are almost finished. So I think we feel pretty good about -- that's obviously an investment we did, but I think we'll start to reap the benefits of that. I don't know, Greg...\n\n---\n\nYes, and just to kind of get a summarized answer. Basically, 3 to 5 years is when we would say it pays back. Do you want to go down to an IRR perspective? The reality is that we have more good ideas to invest in and then we have the resources, the people to be able to execute. So we continue to think sort of most of these -- we're not solving for 3 to 5 years. We typically think IRR is the best benchmark. But we continue to see good opportunities out there and it's really just a matter of how much the system can handle with the number of good people we've got available to do these things.\n\n---\n\nAnd then since you closed on the bank sale, there's been some scrutiny around your bank partner. The stock's down a decent amount. Can you just talk about the diligence you did before you picked a partner to kind of assuage some of the fears around what's going on there.\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean I'm not going to comment on that issue, that's another company. But the diligence was extensive. We're very comfortable with the execution and the integration that's happened over the past few months. We're off to a good start with EA in terms of integration. We look forward to the tax season that's executing it so...\n\n---\n\nAll right. There's a question on this side of the room and then we'll go to Michael after that.\n\n---\n\nThis is Herb Buchbinder, Wells Fargo. Years ago, you had executive tax, which didn't really take off and then it became Premium and now Block Advisors. But is it that the problem that the market perceives Block is serving the lower-income taxpayer and you never really are able to do that well with the middle- or upper-income taxpayer? So how can Block Advisors overcome that and succeed this year and longer term?\n\n---\n\nWe'll find out. We believe that we've done extensive research on this. Laura has led the team in terms of looking at the segments. I think, we kind of rolled the ball onto the court before and said let's see who wants to pick that up. I think now we have a much more focused marketing effort. I think we have a much more focused value proposition and we think we're going to be able to, both in terms of the real estate we pick, the services we provide, be able to offer at a very compelling service. So I don't -- the world's different now. I don't worry about what executive tax service was. We think we have the right proposition. And by the way, H&R Block Premium was doing fine. We just think we can accelerate it.\n\n---\n\nYou don’t have any regrets that you got rid of RSM McGladrey?\n\n---\n\nNo, I do not. I think it was a good deal for H&R Block and it was a good deal for the partners that are RSM McGladrey.\n\n---\n\nThe other thing is it's a simple deal, but the fact that your clients got a less refund last year, might that have a negative influence on them coming back with them looking for help somewhere else because they may not understand why their refund was down?\n\n---\n\nNo, I think all of our indications from the offices were people understood this was the law of the land. This was -- we did -- I don't recall one instance where anyone blamed the tax preparer. So I don't view that was a threat at all.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Let's get to Michael and then we'll go in the back with Paul.\n\n---\n\nMichael Millman, Millman Research Associates. Just following up on the BofI question. Is there a plan B if that blows up? Couple of other questions. On investment grade, can you quantify the cost and the risk of being off investment grade and maybe discuss, I guess, why investment grade is so wonderful? And on Sand Canyon, can you give us kind of a bid-and-ask between what you're offering and what's asked? And if indeed you were able to close it out at this level, how much cash would you free up?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So on BofI -- there's no plan B. We have a 7-year deal we signed with BofI and we're confident that that will be executed. With regard to investment grade, quantifying the cost and I don't know...\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, what we've said consistently is we have been investment grade for 60 years and we have now publicly said that we're committing to that. We've not said these are the 16 reasons we don't think that's a very valuable exercise to go through. We're comfortable being at the low end of investment grade. We've now quantified what that looks like and that's who we are.\n\n---\n\nAnd with regard to Sand Canyon?\n\n---\n\nYes, so the way I would best answer this always is, look at the 10-Ks, look at the Qs because there are lots of great disclosure in there. The representation and warranty reserve is the best estimate of the expected liability. So that is the best estimate. That reserve, as you looked at it over the last several years, has changed very modestly, really just to reflect kind of real-time negotiations the Sand Canyon management team is in. We've had some successful settlements through that process. They continue to be in a limited number of engagements to go through that. I get frustrated with the time personally, I'm business person in life, which is move on with life, but the reality is you're dealing with very complex legal issues with a number of counterparties and so it just takes time. It's frustratingly slow. In addition to the $154 million reserve, of course, they've got additional equity, which, I think Mike, you were asking about, to the tune of $200 million-plus of additional equity. Our view at Block, I think, if you talked to the Sand Canyon management team, they'd say it's going to take multiple years to unwind. And frankly our case that we think is most likely is it comes down to 0. So I'm not expecting any cash back in the future. I'd be happy at a 0 outcome.\n\n---\n\nWhen you say 0, you're talking about the equity as well?\n\n---\n\nCorrect.\n\n---\n\nAnd why have all these banks -- and obviously there's good reason, but why have they been able to settle some years ago and Sand Canyon's still working this out?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's actually good question, Mike. I mean, the broadest answer is they have ongoing relationships with the GSEs, they have ongoing relationships with their regulators and they have motivation to settle that and move on so they can continue to do business. Sand Canyon's perspective is we don't do mortgages anymore. We're not in the banking system. And realistically, the best strategy that Sand Canyon's Board of Directors and its management has said, this is just something that we think will take time and we're going to do it properly and thoroughly. There is no rush to a simple answer because of other reasons.\n\n---\n\nSo we'll go to Paul in the back and then Jeff right next to Michael.\n\n---\n\nPaul Hamilos from RS Investments. You guys make a compelling case about eliminating EITC fraud and identity fraud. And as a taxpayer, I'm outraged by it. I'd love to see that effort succeed. But how does that actually drive revenue for H&R Block? I can see how it might change the market share statistics to look more favorable, but how would that -- how would eliminating fraudulent returns actually drive more revenue?\n\n---\n\nSo let me take an attempt and then, Greg, if you want to add anything. First of all, as a principal, I don't want to make money on the fraudulent returns, as the CEO of this company, as a company that's been in the business for 60 years. If we eliminate fraud and -- I don't want to make money on fraudulent returns. I think taxpayer confidence, I think that overall, fraud is not a good thing for an industry. So the first thing is, I think, as an industry, we have to concentrate on trying to have as much integrity in this system as we can. So that's part of the -- part of the reason why I push on this issue so much. I think, though, as we can get to better compliance, getting fraudsters out of there, I think the net benefit as an industry leader is that we will benefit. I can't quantify what that amount is, but that's probably the way I'd answer it. I don’t know, Greg, if you have anything to add.\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, Paul, I can go on for an hour here, but a couple of ones that come to my mind; 40% of all returns in the United States are done by independents and independent can be defined as a lot of things. Half of those half or 20% of all returns are people that do less than 100 returns. Half of the half or 20% of all returns are done by the people that do over 100 returns. And the reality is that the quality of work that gets done there is awful and it's increasingly where most of the fraud is. A lot of those people have no business doing tax returns. In the event that there are minimum standards in place, they're going to have difficulty meeting those and will likely, to some extent, some of them will exit the system. That return still has to get done somewhere. We would be a natural place for that, we would think. So that's one example. And just to be clear, there are a number of independents that do a very fine job and we see those as well. But when you actually look and -- we shared some statistics. I mean, when we go on diligence and we're actually reunderwriting tax returns from better quality people and we're saying 1 in 4 have an issue, and of those, like half of them are basically committing fraud, it's shocking, okay. The DIY side, I mean, that is one of those ones that, I think, Bill's point is when a brand is -- if you've got a product that people have belief in that you see yourself as a safe harbor, as people are impacted personally by fraud or as fraud is fixed in the system, those people who have their taxes done will naturally gravitate to, we think, to companies like Block. There are other examples, but those are just some.\n\n---\n\nIt's Jeffrey Silber with BMO Capital Markets. I actually wanted to go back to the DIY products. I'm not going to ask you about pricing, don't worry about that. But maybe if we can talk just about overall marketing? Maybe I'm not your target market, but I'm just surprised that we don't see more marketing specifically for your DIY product. Can you talk about the strategy and how you think you can increase awareness on it?\n\n---\n\nLet me try that first and then Jason, okay. There's a lot of marketing on the DIY. The large majority of our spend is online, which we think that is the most effective and most payout, but we spend very competitively with -- as Jason terms them, the market leader. That is a real grind it out, day by day, hour by hour. So we spend a large majority of our spend online, which you maybe don't see or whatever. We also have historically, and again we're not going to comment on this, have run over the year television advertising and other broad market advertising. We're not going to comment on whether we will or will not do that. But as Greg said earlier, the real variable cost we have with DIY is the marketing line. We don't break it out specifically. I don’t think the market leader does either. But I'm satisfied that we have sufficient weight behind DIY. I don't know if there's anything you want to add, Jason.\n\n---\n\nNo. I appreciate the question, Jeff. And as I mentioned, we've increased awareness by 16 points in the last 4 seasons. And I haven't seen tax awareness numbers, but I don't think that they come anywhere close to that. That's the first thing I would say. But to me, the best way to ultimately market the product is by having a great product. And I think, that's where, regardless of how much we've marketed and how much we've seen the awareness grow, I think our product is what's really changed over the last 4 years and I outlined some of that. But even coming off last tax season, we saw our retention increase over 200 basis points. And coming off last tax season, we feel really good about the changes that we have in place for the product this year. I mentioned that we've done a lot of work to make the product responsive, we're multiscreened, but this year, really behind the scenes, we've completely rewritten the beginning; the middle, the topic transitions, which is really where the client looks for the software to tell me what's next and what should I expect, what do I need to do and the logic we've put in there is brand-new; and then we've completely rewritten the ending experience where we really close the client. And then we proactively used our analytics team in order to put what we call pro tips to look at specific clients and figure out what something we can tell them provocatively throughout the interview in order to help them explain something and use our expertise that otherwise they might have missed. And so those are just some of the changes that we put in place this season, but I'm really excited about the product that we released and just went live last Friday.\n\n---\n\nAny other questions?\n\n---\n\nLast one.\n\n---\n\nScott, yes.\n\n---\n\nScott Schneeberger, Oppenheimer, again. Greg, going over the -- all the pieces of guidance for this year, it looks like there's going to be a significant reduction once everyone updates their models for EPS. Could you speak to the first 2 points, the bank divestiture? That's incremental to what we've had modeled for the transaction for a couple of years, correct?\n\n---\n\nSo the numbers that we outlined should be consistent with prior numbers that we've shared with you.\n\n---\n\nWe've said $0.08 to $0.10 all along.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's -- and what you provided today was just reiteration.\n\n---\n\nDetails to make sure that you're all up-to-date and squared away with that.\n\n---\n\nAnd it was also to break out between revenue and expense. We had generally given a large -- and Greg and the accounting team have worked through that piece. So that's what -- Greg was trying to give you real specific details so that you could build those models.\n\n---\n\nGot it. That's helpful. And then the $22 million, that's onetime and we wouldn't -- that's not in the 29% to 30% EBITDA margin, correct?\n\n---\n\nThat's one time. So that was adjusted EBITDA number we gave you, yes. That's adjusted out.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, lastly, I know the maintained long-term guidance is 28% to 32%, just a bit of feel from the 29% to 30% EBITDA margin this year. How -- are we going to have a nice rebound directionally thereafter?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, we -- 28% to 32% is kind of what we think is the right margin for now. Our goal is not to increase margin percentage other than if it's a byproduct of revenue growth, which is the question that Gil had asked earlier. The way to create real sustainable value for shareholders is to get revenue growing greater than 4%, we then get natural margin expansion. If we don't get that, then -- so what my point is we're going to take costs out of the system, but we're reinvesting it in future revenue opportunities that we believe will happen. If under some hypothesis that doesn't happen, we can take costs out of the business and move margin percentage up like we've done. I mean, it wasn't that long ago that we were 26% EBITDA margin. So the 28 % to 32% is really reflective of a short term -- to sort of short term, medium term. We may revise it. But it really is going to be mostly a function of our revenue performance.\n\n---\n\nAnd Scott, I think what we're trying to do, because we want to be clear that from the highest level, we are very excited, very committed. We're finally, if you will, running the company we wanted to run, focused on core tax preparation. This is a transition year, so we have to go through the onetimer of the BofI piece we just talked about. We have the literal onetime transaction costs, which also are not only BofI but include all the capital structure stuff that we did effectively onetimer. And then, with really the number being higher than what we had probably anticipated a couple of years ago, that 600 franchise locations coming back in, some success on the independent piece, that there are expenses associated with -- especially on the franchise, just we're paying for the payroll now and the rent and everything else and the revenue will catch up. So that what we'll find is, what Greg was trying to lay out is, take those to the side here. Beyond that, we think we have controlled expenses pretty well in this company. Greg has put a terrific productivity team together that's stamped on everyone's heads, so I wouldn't assume that we're trying to set a new course in terms of spending or whatever. I think you can count on us being within -- executing the way we have in the past. And when there are investments we have to make, like last year's training piece and we think that's going to pay out, we'll do that as a onetimer. But for the most part, setting those 3 things aside, we're sort of within the balance of what we've been doing.\n\n---\n\nAnd I agree and then, there has been a good job of expense control. One final question of a financial nature. The, I think, it's 240 locations bought in this year, about $100 million, I think you spent about the same last year for more locations. Is this just going up higher on the tree to pick the fruit? And I understand you're getting great margins for what you're acquiring. And if you could elaborate a little bit more on strategically where are these locations, is this is Latino market targeted? Or just any elaboration there.\n\n---\n\nWe'll clarify with you off-line, but the numbers are not -- they were more different and it was reflective of -- the average purchase price per store is really not that different year-to-year, so I think that's maybe just how you wrote your notes or something. We can get you those exact numbers. The markets themselves typically were, I would call, the middle sized cities around the country. It isn't -- I wouldn't point out that it was heavily Latino or not. But these are sort of secondary, third sort of, say, like Springfield, Missouri, Lansing, Michigan places like that.\n\n---\n\nAnd it's 260 for this year, not 240. Last year was 340.\n\n---\n\nWe'll do one last question with Herb.\n\n---\n\nCan you just comment briefly about the focus of your TV advertising this year and how much you'll hit on ACA issues on television?\n\n---\n\nNot going to talk about marketing. Never do with these meetings.\n\n---\n\nYou'll like it.\n\n---\n\nAll right. We'll wrap. Yes.\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you all very much for coming. And thank you for those of you listening online. And here's to a great tax season.",
      "transcript_text4": "【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nBefore we take questions, one quick ask. If you all could please state your name and your company, just for the transcript purposes, when we get the mic to you. We have a couple of runners with the mics and please stating your question into the microphone would be great. So starting there with George.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Tong (Analysts)】\nGeorge Tong with Piper Jaffray. I want to talk with EITC fraud. It accounted for about 2/3 of the volume decline last year in the assisted business, so clearly an important part of the business. Bill, can you talk about how the conversations are going with legislators, with the IRS in terms of addressing the fraud? How much you expect the fraud to slow in the coming years? And what additional steps need to be taken?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, so -- and then Kathy, if you want to add anything after I try to answer George's question. The conversations, I mean, there is clear recognition that for this program to sustain, and there is support for the EITC program generally on both sides of the aisle. But that $14 billion to $17 billion in the last year of, call it, as Kathy said, improper payments for fraud, is not sustainable. When you have 25% of the payments going out that are improper, something needs to be done about that. So there's great recognition on that. There's clear understanding now that the disparity between the documentation requirements between DIY and assisted is not -- doesn't makes sense. So that's why, for this year, the number of questions has been reduced for paid preparers. And then as Kathy indicated, there's a pilot going on, which ourselves and a few other DIY preparers are participating in with the intent that, in '17, the following tax season, we would have parity along those lines. So that is proceeding quite well. Again, we're working with the -- there's always a misbelief that the IRS controls everything. IRS basically takes their direction from the Treasury. So there is real understanding with the Treasury -- I've talked to the highest levels of the Treasury and the IRS, that this is the way forward. So I'm very pleased -- sometimes people will say, why are you guys -- you'll never get anything done with the government, et cetera. Well, Kathy and Marie van Luling and the whole GR team works really hard on this. So we have made some real progress on that. How this translates to how much of the fraud will decline, hard to say. It's difficult for us to really forecast that that will lead to X, Y or Z. The public-private partnership that Kathy referenced where we're doing a lot of things, which is more around SERF, but really impacts EITC because all of this stuff is tied together, are ways forward. So we've got real change on the documentation requirements. We have a public-private partner. We've all signed a memorandum of understanding, all the names you know in the DIY space. So I do think the ball is being advanced. But I think Kathy said at the end, is it going to stop fraud, no, but I think we are moving along. So I'm pleased that we're making -- this is part of the job is really to try to impact this. Is there anything else you want to add just...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kathy Pickering (Executives)】\nI think you really captured it. We're in great shape for the progress that we've made for 2016, really pleased with the pilot and the changes in the audit questions. And then for 2017, we're really looking to see those form changes for consistency across the filing channels and then the additional legislation that the IRS is pushing for. And with all that, I think we'll definitely see more progress in that area.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nOkay. Scott?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nScott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. First, I'd like to start, you guys typically do not provide a revenue guidance and there is a lot of guidance here and it's appreciated. Could you just speak to the top line a little bit outside of these puts and takes, but how you think about it perhaps in this year, if you want to share, and then again longer term?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, I'll let Greg address that. And again, Scott, I think Greg will, I think, reiterate what he said earlier about the 4 components of revenue with -- go ahead, Greg.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, we try to provide you with things that we think will be meaningful for you. I mean, I know it's always a question where people want more. But the reality is when you go into a tax season, when you look at even our internal models, we've got sort of lots of champion-challenger models. There's still a fair amount of -- even coming down to the last week, and so that's partly why we don't do it. But there's also a portion of why we don't do it is because the reality is that we are the industry leaders and a lot of competitors' strategy is to copy what we do and so we don't want to make it easy for them. But in terms of our ideas about revenue, it really is those 4 drivers: it's price, it's volume, it's mix and it's attach. We feel good about 3 of the 4, but the reality is, for us to be successful, it's got to be 4 of the 4 moving together. These are things that take time. These are things we're optimistic about. We're continuing to make investments smartly into a number of programs that will drive that. But when you only really have a chance to do business once a year, progress is measured over time and that's just a reality for our business. That's kind of our high-level thoughts on it, Scott.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nI appreciate that. And just a similar question, different category. In return of capital, just your thoughts on what you're going to do with the dividend longer term. And also have you been buying back stock since the tender? And I know you're not going to forecast that, and I haven't done the math of what's implied in this year's share count guidance. But just thoughts on those two, dividend, and then what's the ongoing plan with the repurchases?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, so let me start with the dividend. I mean, as you all know, we've been paying a dividend for 50-plus years. It's something we take very seriously. We did increase it, but the increase was actually 3-plus years ago. We were prohibited also during the time we were a savings and loan holding company from increasing the dividend. We did ask, but we were prohibited from doing that. We have chosen not to yet clarify dividend policy for a number of reasons, the main one is that we had a lot of other things we wanted to get out of the way. We understand, as a company, this is one of the things that we can do to create value for us. So you'd expect sometime in the near future for us to have a more specific articulation of dividend policy. As it relates in the share repurchase, we bought back 1.5 billion of shares, it was a very material execution for us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\n$1.5 billion.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSorry, $1.5 billion. Thank you, Bill. So soon, I forget. So we completed successfully $1.5 billion and the reality is that that was a very big step forward. There were a lot of things that were moving. Since then, we've not bought back shares. To be very clear, we're very happy at buying them back at $37. But the way we think about share repurchase is opportunistic, and we think about creating medium- and long-term value. And we want the historic record to reflect that we were very smart on how we bought those shares back on your behalf. Part of which you heard from us in our articulation is, over the years we think we've done a good job at that, so let us do our jobs here for you. We have $2 billion of remaining authorization. We have some time to work with, but we're also going to be smart about how we do that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nOkay. Let's go with Anj and then Gil and then Kartik.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nAnj Singh from Crédit Suisse. Really appreciate all the color and transparency that you guys gave around ACA, EITC, fraud and even the financial outlook. But wanted to get a little bit more color on the ACA opportunity as we think about it longer term. You guys said 16.4% of your clients were impacted, 16.6% for the overall market. Could you, I guess, get into why are you still trailing the market in that category. And also I'd be interested to see how much of your ACA impacted mix is DIY versus assisted. And do you have a sense of how much of the market is DIY versus assisted in that ACA-impacted category?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nSo let me just understand trail. When you say trailing in the market, I just want to understand what do you mean by...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nSo you have slightly lower...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\n16.6% versus 16.4%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nYes, it's slightly lower.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nOh, okay, okay, okay. You guys want to take that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nGo ahead, Mark.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Ciaramitaro (Executives)】\nSo first of all, I'm just going to say, generally, this is going to take time to play out. We don't believe that there's a material difference between ourselves in the category. One of the -- probably what would account for that biggest change this year, as you saw, a lot of exemptions are being done in the DIY space, and so that's part of the explanation of what's going on, at least in this current year results. If not for that, we would be at or above. I also indicated that on our assisted side, a significantly larger percentage of our retail clients are -- were the ACA impacted and that's going to begin to play out at a greater degree going forward. But it's going to be a long term kind of -- we gave you a little bit of a sense of where we think we're headed ultimately, but it's going to take a number of years for this to play out, we've always said that. And we believe that over time, as Greg said, that the mix of that impact will change over time. More complicated reconciliation and exemption clients, fewer penalty clients will be impacted. So there's both a volume and a mix impact.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nI will say that from last season, more sort of broadly as management, we were very pleased with how ACA went from Block's perspective. We were really looking at the client experience because the reality is it was a lot of education that we had to provide to our tax professionals through all the changes to our DIY experience, and we looked very carefully at the client experience from that. And we also compared ourselves to a lot of the competition out there, and the reality is, there was a lot of very poor execution by other companies out there. And we think over time that will matter because this is a very real issue for people. As Mark said, the penalties are very real here. The notices are going to start coming. People will have to sit down and account for their decisions as it relates to their taxes, but also for their health care. And that's why, for us, it wasn't so much about the numbers last year, it was about our execution and we were very pleased with that. Yes, Gil.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nWe had a very -- you had a very interesting discussion about...\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nJust say -- I know who you are, but say your name first.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nGil Luria, Wedbush Securities. We had a very interesting conversation about identity fraud and you don't have the numbers for this last season, but based on anecdotal evidence, it went from $3 million a couple of years ago, maybe double in the last couple of years. That's a very big number. Assuming that's all online and digital, I'm assuming there's very little of that happening in the stores. Do you think the steps this year will be effective enough to either reduce that number or reduce those growth rates? And then if it does, per the charts that you put up there, there is still a gap between the rejection -- you file rejection rates online versus in-stores. So wouldn't that impact your digital business somewhat? Your competitor from Mountain View has talked about the fact that yes, it would impact them if there was less fraud, but it would impact everybody. Wouldn't you be concerned that if that particular line, that you'd have some impact from the fraud declining?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nSo yes, about 3 questions in there. So let me try to carve it up. One is you're correct, the IRS commissioner himself acknowledges that, still on identity refund fraud, it's virtually all DIY. So it is not an assisted issue for any assisted preparer. It's really a digital preparer. Now when it comes to the volume piece, I guess, Jason, you should take that. And then your middle question was, I think, more for Kathy, was you wanted to know the -- would that affect our volume if everything went down?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nDo you expected the decline or just slow growth and then if it does decline or slow growth, wouldn't that impact the digital line?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nJason, you want to take that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nWell, so what I showed as far as our own reject rates, there is a difference between assisted and DIY because for a do-it-yourself user, as I mentioned, they're really confident in their preparation skills, but that doesn't mean that they're very good at it. So we would always expect the difference between assisted and DIY, there to be a gap or potentially double. Our rates, when we look at it -- we're always trying to improve our reject rate and I think that we're making progress. But as I mentioned, there are -- there's a wide disparity in the reject rates among competitors and the tax software industry and I think that you see those rates and how they correlate to e-file growth. As those come down, what I think that you'll see is competitors in the industry looking more like H&R Block tax offers. I think our own tax offer, I think we have opportunity, but I do think that it will affect other competitors going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nThen a question on Block Advisors. Do you feel you have the appropriate staffing? Or are you going to need to hire CPAs or fold in other CPA practices in order to deliver the Block Advisors and extend the brand? And then Bill and Greg have worked really hard over the last few years to get out of all the ancillary business and you put up a slide that says you're getting into payroll and bookkeeping. Is there a slippery slope there that extends you into far-field businesses that after all that hard work of getting into it, how many -- 600 and how many days, Greg?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, all right. So let me take both of those, and Laura, if you want to add anything. So for this year, it's essentially a transition, translation of what was formally H&R Block Premium to Block Advisors. So we have staff in place already, and these are -- as part of H&R Block Premium, these are among our most experienced and knowledgeable. The H&R Block Premium team has always dealt with more sophisticated tax clients. We think that we can build a brand here that would involve having to train and potentially be able to absorb more CPAs, so that, in the long run, you're in the right zone. But in terms of for this particular tax season, we feel very confident that we have the staff to handle that and we have obviously recruited more. And we think that we're going to be able to attract more people to a brand like this that might be more for CPAs or independents serving that kind of clientele to really impact that -- to want to seek to be part of Block Advisors. So we feel good about that. Now with regard to the payroll in that regard, I would caution you not to go too far because we have a business services Package today. We have an ability to serve clients on their business returns, both tax, et cetera. This is a small movement out. We're testing it. I don't see it as a slippery slope at all. I see it as a natural extension of what a more sophisticated client would want. As Laura said earlier, about 1 in 5 in our research are small business owners, so we want to be able to serve them on what I would call -- and this is small -- when we're talking small business, we're talking everyone from self-employed to a few employees. So that's -- I think it's in pretty close here. It's more of a bookkeeping play. That's what I would say.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nJust keep in mind, Gil, offering doesn't mean that we're actually doing it right, so we typically are leveraging partnerships to do a lot of that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nSo then last one, for you, Greg. You talked about the cost of the [indiscernible] being 1 point of EBITDA margin and that's the extent of reduction in EBITDA that you have from last year to this year. What about operating leverage? To the extent that you get revenue and you're getting very high incremental rates, when do we start seeing the operating leverage on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSo if you think top-down about our business model and the way our costs behave, we tend to be kind of a mix between fixed costs and variable costs. The main variable cost we incur, there're really 2 forms, and one is on the assisted side, the tax professional's variable comp, okay. But that represents for the next dollar of revenue, about 1/3 of that goes in their pocket, and after that, once you've paid for fixed costs, its margin. On the DIY side, it's really actually the marketing dollars because those actually are quite variable and we push those up and so, there's also the next dollar of revenue, there's something less than 50% that goes up into our variable costs. When we model all that out, you include things like wage inflation and rent inflation in that, we would typically hit our fixed costs inflection point at about 3.5% of revenue growth. There are some, depends on what the revenue is, but for all intents and purposes. So as we're able to get to 4%, you then would have a natural impact on your margin percentage expansion. So as I've said to many of you over the years, Block is able to successfully get to 4-plus percent of revenue will naturally be EBITDA margin expansion and so that's what we're focused on, is getting to that fixed cost leverage point.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nLet's go to Kartik in the third row.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nKartik on the aisle.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nYou talked a lot about EITC and maybe the processes that are going to take place over the next couple of years. But as you look at this tax season, is there another headwind you're anticipating because of EITC at least for the retail business, and if so, what would you -- how would you quantify that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nAnother -- I don't know. No, I don’t see...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nNo, I mean, for example, 2 years ago we decided to eliminate the free EZ program. That had an initial 1-year impact. Last year was sort of the echo effect, that's not going to recur this year. But really there's nothing that I would -- that jumped to my mind unless Bill's got something I've forgotten about.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nWell, I thought last year, you said 2/3 of the clients that you didn't retain were because of EITC that migrated away from retail to digital. So you don't expect that to happen this year? You don’t expect any type of migration from retail to digital on the EITC side?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nNo, I don't think we -- I thought you meant for a new -- I think until we get real parity, real -- I think that that possibility, we're going to work hard, we've got a lot of programs against that, but that -- the trend on that would, at this point, probably continue. The question is how deep? Will it be as extensive as past seasons? I'm not going to forecast any of that. But that would be a continuing issue because we don't have documentation requirements at parity. There's still all the stuff that Kathy talked about with regard to the fraud piece. There's still 25% impact. That doesn't flip in a year. I think we're making some strides, but -- so that will be -- I guess, you could term that a continuation.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nJust to be clear, Kartik, we never said that all of them went to digital. Some of them went to digital, some of them went to other assisted competitors, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nYes. And then, Jason, just for you. You showed the products you're going to have on digital and what your competitors are doing. Does this mean you don't anticipate having an absolute 0 product or a product that has no cost for federal and no cost for state, and no cost a financial product?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nThanks for your question, Kartik, but I'm not going to comment on any pricing or promotion that we might offer in the upcoming season.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYou'll find out soon.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nCould we go back to Thomas Allen back there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nThomas, we'll try to get you a better seat next year, okay?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nIf you guys can please just state your name and company.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nThomas Allen, Morgan Stanley. So 3 initiatives you guys are doing, buying back the franchisees and buying independents is the first. Second one is obviously all your investments are in the Affordable Care Act. Third one is switching from the Premium to Block Advisors. Can you just talk about kind of the investment period? For example, I think you invested heavily in ACA last year and then when do you start to see these be tailwinds rather than headwinds?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, so let's take them one at a more time. I think, as Greg said, we've made a big investment on the A&D side, especially on the franchise buybacks, we will have completed 600 in 2 years, 600 buybacks. It has moved the mix to 65-35. As Greg said, and I said in my opening, compelling returns. We're buying these really well. But they do increase our expense base, especially in off-quarters like you saw here. So I think that that -- we're near the end of the runway or at the end of the runway on the franchise buybacks. We'll continue to look at independents. So that -- and obviously, when we look at independents with the stuff that Kathy talked about, we have to make sure we're buying somebody that we think can fit our ethics, our accuracy, et cetera. Then on ACA, big increase last -- or big investment last year in training and marketing. We think we're going to be able to realize that. We think we did a great job with our tax pros. The refresher training is much more limited, as Greg pointed out. So we actually think we're going to start to reap the benefits of that investment from last year and being the place to go for ACA. The third area was Block Advisors. Okay, so I think that, we're going to see how this plays out. We did convert 300 offices. We want to see how this plays out. Our plans are in the, longer term, that this fits within our capital structure and our expense structure as we said. The offices will be profitable this year because they are essentially going concerns, so I think we'll be able to realize that. We're not indicating levels or amounts or anything like that, but we feel good about the transition. I know our tax pros that are in the office are very excited about it. In various markets, you can stop in and see them. There're a couple here in New York that are almost finished. So I think we feel pretty good about -- that's obviously an investment we did, but I think we'll start to reap the benefits of that. I don't know, Greg...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, and just to kind of get a summarized answer. Basically, 3 to 5 years is when we would say it pays back. Do you want to go down to an IRR perspective? The reality is that we have more good ideas to invest in and then we have the resources, the people to be able to execute. So we continue to think sort of most of these -- we're not solving for 3 to 5 years. We typically think IRR is the best benchmark. But we continue to see good opportunities out there and it's really just a matter of how much the system can handle with the number of good people we've got available to do these things.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nAnd then since you closed on the bank sale, there's been some scrutiny around your bank partner. The stock's down a decent amount. Can you just talk about the diligence you did before you picked a partner to kind of assuage some of the fears around what's going on there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, I mean I'm not going to comment on that issue, that's another company. But the diligence was extensive. We're very comfortable with the execution and the integration that's happened over the past few months. We're off to a good start with EA in terms of integration. We look forward to the tax season that's executing it so...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nAll right. There's a question on this side of the room and then we'll go to Michael after that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Herbert Buchbinder (Analysts)】\nThis is Herb Buchbinder, Wells Fargo. Years ago, you had executive tax, which didn't really take off and then it became Premium and now Block Advisors. But is it that the problem that the market perceives Block is serving the lower-income taxpayer and you never really are able to do that well with the middle- or upper-income taxpayer? So how can Block Advisors overcome that and succeed this year and longer term?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWe'll find out. We believe that we've done extensive research on this. Laura has led the team in terms of looking at the segments. I think, we kind of rolled the ball onto the court before and said let's see who wants to pick that up. I think now we have a much more focused marketing effort. I think we have a much more focused value proposition and we think we're going to be able to, both in terms of the real estate we pick, the services we provide, be able to offer at a very compelling service. So I don't -- the world's different now. I don't worry about what executive tax service was. We think we have the right proposition. And by the way, H&R Block Premium was doing fine. We just think we can accelerate it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Herbert Buchbinder (Analysts)】\nYou don’t have any regrets that you got rid of RSM McGladrey?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nNo, I do not. I think it was a good deal for H&R Block and it was a good deal for the partners that are RSM McGladrey.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Herbert Buchbinder (Analysts)】\nThe other thing is it's a simple deal, but the fact that your clients got a less refund last year, might that have a negative influence on them coming back with them looking for help somewhere else because they may not understand why their refund was down?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nNo, I think all of our indications from the offices were people understood this was the law of the land. This was -- we did -- I don't recall one instance where anyone blamed the tax preparer. So I don't view that was a threat at all.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nOkay. Let's get to Michael and then we'll go in the back with Paul.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nMichael Millman, Millman Research Associates. Just following up on the BofI question. Is there a plan B if that blows up? Couple of other questions. On investment grade, can you quantify the cost and the risk of being off investment grade and maybe discuss, I guess, why investment grade is so wonderful? And on Sand Canyon, can you give us kind of a bid-and-ask between what you're offering and what's asked? And if indeed you were able to close it out at this level, how much cash would you free up?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nOkay. So on BofI -- there's no plan B. We have a 7-year deal we signed with BofI and we're confident that that will be executed. With regard to investment grade, quantifying the cost and I don't know...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, what we've said consistently is we have been investment grade for 60 years and we have now publicly said that we're committing to that. We've not said these are the 16 reasons we don't think that's a very valuable exercise to go through. We're comfortable being at the low end of investment grade. We've now quantified what that looks like and that's who we are.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nAnd with regard to Sand Canyon?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, so the way I would best answer this always is, look at the 10-Ks, look at the Qs because there are lots of great disclosure in there. The representation and warranty reserve is the best estimate of the expected liability. So that is the best estimate. That reserve, as you looked at it over the last several years, has changed very modestly, really just to reflect kind of real-time negotiations the Sand Canyon management team is in. We've had some successful settlements through that process. They continue to be in a limited number of engagements to go through that. I get frustrated with the time personally, I'm business person in life, which is move on with life, but the reality is you're dealing with very complex legal issues with a number of counterparties and so it just takes time. It's frustratingly slow. In addition to the $154 million reserve, of course, they've got additional equity, which, I think Mike, you were asking about, to the tune of $200 million-plus of additional equity. Our view at Block, I think, if you talked to the Sand Canyon management team, they'd say it's going to take multiple years to unwind. And frankly our case that we think is most likely is it comes down to 0. So I'm not expecting any cash back in the future. I'd be happy at a 0 outcome.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nWhen you say 0, you're talking about the equity as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nCorrect.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nAnd why have all these banks -- and obviously there's good reason, but why have they been able to settle some years ago and Sand Canyon's still working this out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, it's actually good question, Mike. I mean, the broadest answer is they have ongoing relationships with the GSEs, they have ongoing relationships with their regulators and they have motivation to settle that and move on so they can continue to do business. Sand Canyon's perspective is we don't do mortgages anymore. We're not in the banking system. And realistically, the best strategy that Sand Canyon's Board of Directors and its management has said, this is just something that we think will take time and we're going to do it properly and thoroughly. There is no rush to a simple answer because of other reasons.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nSo we'll go to Paul in the back and then Jeff right next to Michael.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Hamilos (Analysts)】\nPaul Hamilos from RS Investments. You guys make a compelling case about eliminating EITC fraud and identity fraud. And as a taxpayer, I'm outraged by it. I'd love to see that effort succeed. But how does that actually drive revenue for H&R Block? I can see how it might change the market share statistics to look more favorable, but how would that -- how would eliminating fraudulent returns actually drive more revenue?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nSo let me take an attempt and then, Greg, if you want to add anything. First of all, as a principal, I don't want to make money on the fraudulent returns, as the CEO of this company, as a company that's been in the business for 60 years. If we eliminate fraud and -- I don't want to make money on fraudulent returns. I think taxpayer confidence, I think that overall, fraud is not a good thing for an industry. So the first thing is, I think, as an industry, we have to concentrate on trying to have as much integrity in this system as we can. So that's part of the -- part of the reason why I push on this issue so much. I think, though, as we can get to better compliance, getting fraudsters out of there, I think the net benefit as an industry leader is that we will benefit. I can't quantify what that amount is, but that's probably the way I'd answer it. I don’t know, Greg, if you have anything to add.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, Paul, I can go on for an hour here, but a couple of ones that come to my mind; 40% of all returns in the United States are done by independents and independent can be defined as a lot of things. Half of those half or 20% of all returns are people that do less than 100 returns. Half of the half or 20% of all returns are done by the people that do over 100 returns. And the reality is that the quality of work that gets done there is awful and it's increasingly where most of the fraud is. A lot of those people have no business doing tax returns. In the event that there are minimum standards in place, they're going to have difficulty meeting those and will likely, to some extent, some of them will exit the system. That return still has to get done somewhere. We would be a natural place for that, we would think. So that's one example. And just to be clear, there are a number of independents that do a very fine job and we see those as well. But when you actually look and -- we shared some statistics. I mean, when we go on diligence and we're actually reunderwriting tax returns from better quality people and we're saying 1 in 4 have an issue, and of those, like half of them are basically committing fraud, it's shocking, okay. The DIY side, I mean, that is one of those ones that, I think, Bill's point is when a brand is -- if you've got a product that people have belief in that you see yourself as a safe harbor, as people are impacted personally by fraud or as fraud is fixed in the system, those people who have their taxes done will naturally gravitate to, we think, to companies like Block. There are other examples, but those are just some.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nIt's Jeffrey Silber with BMO Capital Markets. I actually wanted to go back to the DIY products. I'm not going to ask you about pricing, don't worry about that. But maybe if we can talk just about overall marketing? Maybe I'm not your target market, but I'm just surprised that we don't see more marketing specifically for your DIY product. Can you talk about the strategy and how you think you can increase awareness on it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nLet me try that first and then Jason, okay. There's a lot of marketing on the DIY. The large majority of our spend is online, which we think that is the most effective and most payout, but we spend very competitively with -- as Jason terms them, the market leader. That is a real grind it out, day by day, hour by hour. So we spend a large majority of our spend online, which you maybe don't see or whatever. We also have historically, and again we're not going to comment on this, have run over the year television advertising and other broad market advertising. We're not going to comment on whether we will or will not do that. But as Greg said earlier, the real variable cost we have with DIY is the marketing line. We don't break it out specifically. I don’t think the market leader does either. But I'm satisfied that we have sufficient weight behind DIY. I don't know if there's anything you want to add, Jason.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nNo. I appreciate the question, Jeff. And as I mentioned, we've increased awareness by 16 points in the last 4 seasons. And I haven't seen tax awareness numbers, but I don't think that they come anywhere close to that. That's the first thing I would say. But to me, the best way to ultimately market the product is by having a great product. And I think, that's where, regardless of how much we've marketed and how much we've seen the awareness grow, I think our product is what's really changed over the last 4 years and I outlined some of that. But even coming off last tax season, we saw our retention increase over 200 basis points. And coming off last tax season, we feel really good about the changes that we have in place for the product this year. I mentioned that we've done a lot of work to make the product responsive, we're multiscreened, but this year, really behind the scenes, we've completely rewritten the beginning; the middle, the topic transitions, which is really where the client looks for the software to tell me what's next and what should I expect, what do I need to do and the logic we've put in there is brand-new; and then we've completely rewritten the ending experience where we really close the client. And then we proactively used our analytics team in order to put what we call pro tips to look at specific clients and figure out what something we can tell them provocatively throughout the interview in order to help them explain something and use our expertise that otherwise they might have missed. And so those are just some of the changes that we put in place this season, but I'm really excited about the product that we released and just went live last Friday.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nAny other questions?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nLast one.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nScott, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nScott Schneeberger, Oppenheimer, again. Greg, going over the -- all the pieces of guidance for this year, it looks like there's going to be a significant reduction once everyone updates their models for EPS. Could you speak to the first 2 points, the bank divestiture? That's incremental to what we've had modeled for the transaction for a couple of years, correct?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSo the numbers that we outlined should be consistent with prior numbers that we've shared with you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWe've said $0.08 to $0.10 all along.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nAnd that's -- and what you provided today was just reiteration.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nDetails to make sure that you're all up-to-date and squared away with that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nAnd it was also to break out between revenue and expense. We had generally given a large -- and Greg and the accounting team have worked through that piece. So that's what -- Greg was trying to give you real specific details so that you could build those models.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nGot it. That's helpful. And then the $22 million, that's onetime and we wouldn't -- that's not in the 29% to 30% EBITDA margin, correct?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nThat's one time. So that was adjusted EBITDA number we gave you, yes. That's adjusted out.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, lastly, I know the maintained long-term guidance is 28% to 32%, just a bit of feel from the 29% to 30% EBITDA margin this year. How -- are we going to have a nice rebound directionally thereafter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, we -- 28% to 32% is kind of what we think is the right margin for now. Our goal is not to increase margin percentage other than if it's a byproduct of revenue growth, which is the question that Gil had asked earlier. The way to create real sustainable value for shareholders is to get revenue growing greater than 4%, we then get natural margin expansion. If we don't get that, then -- so what my point is we're going to take costs out of the system, but we're reinvesting it in future revenue opportunities that we believe will happen. If under some hypothesis that doesn't happen, we can take costs out of the business and move margin percentage up like we've done. I mean, it wasn't that long ago that we were 26% EBITDA margin. So the 28 % to 32% is really reflective of a short term -- to sort of short term, medium term. We may revise it. But it really is going to be mostly a function of our revenue performance.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nAnd Scott, I think what we're trying to do, because we want to be clear that from the highest level, we are very excited, very committed. We're finally, if you will, running the company we wanted to run, focused on core tax preparation. This is a transition year, so we have to go through the onetimer of the BofI piece we just talked about. We have the literal onetime transaction costs, which also are not only BofI but include all the capital structure stuff that we did effectively onetimer. And then, with really the number being higher than what we had probably anticipated a couple of years ago, that 600 franchise locations coming back in, some success on the independent piece, that there are expenses associated with -- especially on the franchise, just we're paying for the payroll now and the rent and everything else and the revenue will catch up. So that what we'll find is, what Greg was trying to lay out is, take those to the side here. Beyond that, we think we have controlled expenses pretty well in this company. Greg has put a terrific productivity team together that's stamped on everyone's heads, so I wouldn't assume that we're trying to set a new course in terms of spending or whatever. I think you can count on us being within -- executing the way we have in the past. And when there are investments we have to make, like last year's training piece and we think that's going to pay out, we'll do that as a onetimer. But for the most part, setting those 3 things aside, we're sort of within the balance of what we've been doing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nAnd I agree and then, there has been a good job of expense control. One final question of a financial nature. The, I think, it's 240 locations bought in this year, about $100 million, I think you spent about the same last year for more locations. Is this just going up higher on the tree to pick the fruit? And I understand you're getting great margins for what you're acquiring. And if you could elaborate a little bit more on strategically where are these locations, is this is Latino market targeted? Or just any elaboration there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nWe'll clarify with you off-line, but the numbers are not -- they were more different and it was reflective of -- the average purchase price per store is really not that different year-to-year, so I think that's maybe just how you wrote your notes or something. We can get you those exact numbers. The markets themselves typically were, I would call, the middle sized cities around the country. It isn't -- I wouldn't point out that it was heavily Latino or not. But these are sort of secondary, third sort of, say, like Springfield, Missouri, Lansing, Michigan places like that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nAnd it's 260 for this year, not 240. Last year was 340.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nWe'll do one last question with Herb.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Herbert Buchbinder (Analysts)】\nCan you just comment briefly about the focus of your TV advertising this year and how much you'll hit on ACA issues on television?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nNot going to talk about marketing. Never do with these meetings.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYou'll like it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nAll right. We'll wrap. Yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWell, thank you all very much for coming. And thank you for those of you listening online. And here's to a great tax season.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thanks, Selena, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank you for joining us for Brown-Forman's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Paul Varga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jane Morreau, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Fitzgerald, Chief Accounting Officer.\r\nThis morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. \r\nYou should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements whether due to new information, future events or otherwise. This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The release can be found on our website under the section titled Investor Relations. In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operation are contained in the press release. \r\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Jane for her prepared remarks.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Jay, and thanks for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I will be covering 2 topics today, which should leave us plenty of time to address Q&A. First, I'll review our results; and second, I'll discuss our outlook for fiscal 2016, which we confirmed earlier today.\r\nSo let me start by reviewing our recent results. During the first half of fiscal 2016, we grew underlying net sales by 6%. This underlying sales growth was broad-based geographically, with mid- to high single-digit rates of growth in both the developed and emerging markets. In the United States, underlying net sales grew 7% during the first 6 months of the fiscal year. These results were led by the Jack Daniel's family of brands, which grew underlying net sales by 7%. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire contributed almost 3 points of growth in the United States. Our leading portfolio of premium whiskey brands outpaced their competitive set, including aggregate underlying net sales growth of over 30% for the Woodford Reserve family of brands and Old Forester. Our el Jimador and Herradura tequila brands grew well into double digits as the brand building investments we have been making behind both of these leading tequilas are creating important momentum towards achieving our long-term growth strategies. More on those in just a moment.\r\nBefore moving on to our non-U.S. markets, I wanted to share some color on our blended value takeaway trends in the United States for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. Both Nielsen and NABCA's 3-month trends have slowed as we are now comping against last fall's substantial acceleration and takeaway on the heels of the campaign in fiscal 2015 to reach the 5 million case milestone for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. When looking at our takeaway trends on a 2-year basis, which removed short-term comparison issues, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey has consistently grown value takeaway at a very healthy 9% to 10% rate each month this calendar year when compared to 2013.\r\nIn developed markets outside of the United States, the rate of underlying net sales growth improved from the first quarter to the second quarter, resulting in 6% growth during the first half of the fiscal year. Results were up double digits in Germany, France, Belgium and the Czech Republic. Additionally, we experienced solid growth in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Spain. Part of the sequential improvement was also due to Australia, which enjoyed more favorable comparisons than in the first quarter, resulting in first half underlying net sales that were roughly flat year-over-year.\r\nUnderlying net sales in emerging markets grew 8% year-to-date. Strong double-digit gains in Brazil, Turkey, emerging Africa and the CIS countries were offset by declines in China and in Southeast Asia. Mexico grew underlying net sales mid-single digits fueled by New Mix. Poland also experienced growth albeit driven in part by easy comps to last year. Russia's underlying results improved significantly from the first quarter large declines, resulting in now only a slight reduction in year-to-date underlying net sales.\r\nNon-U.S. markets now account for almost 60% of our total revenue, so I thought it would be worthwhile to share some additional color on takeaway trends for some of the markets outside of the United States where we have good visibility. Three-month consumer takeaway trends for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey are up mid-single digits in Germany, France and in Australia. The brand is experiencing mid-single-digit growth in Mexico and is growing high teens in Russia. While Poland is down over the most recent 3 months, we are gaining share in whiskey, and Jack Daniel's is up high teens over the last 12 months. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey is also experiencing a short-term slowdown in the United Kingdom takeaway, driven in part by timing of promotional activities, but 12-month value takeaway is up 10%. So these consumer trends are encouraging as we think about our full year outlook.\r\nGlobal Travel Retail, which accounted for approximately 4% of our stripped net sales in fiscal 2015, continues to be challenging, driven by the decline in spend from high-income travelers, particularly Russian and European. Travel retail's underlying net sales are down 14% year-to-date, a slight improvement from the first quarter but well below our expectations for the business. We continue to believe that some of the softness in the U.S. travel retail channel is the result of the timing of orders, and in fact, we started to see some of those orders coming through during the month of November. Excluding the results of travel retail, total company underlying net sales growth would have been closer to 7% in the first half of the year.\r\nMoving now to the discussion of our results on a brand basis. The Jack Daniel's family of brands grew underlying net sales by 7% year-to-date. Growth for this family in the second quarter reflected a slight improvement from the 6% growth delivered during the first quarter. In the second quarter, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey grew global underlying net sales by 4%, while Tennessee Honey, Gentleman Jack and Jack Daniel's RTDs each grew global underlying net sales at a double-digit rate. \r\nJack Daniel's Tennessee Honey delivered over 30% growth outside the United States, while increased competitive activity in the United States negatively impact U.S. results for Honey. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire contributed almost 1.5 points of growth to the company's underlying net sales growth during the first 6 months of this year as we continue to invest behind the U.S. rollout of this brand. Distribution remains well below the parent brand at roughly 2/3 of Tennessee Whiskey's off-premise distribution and only 1/3 in the entree. We've remained encouraged by the early results from testing Tennessee Fire in a few markets outside the U.S. including the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom and Australia. And we believe that our geographic reach should create significant opportunities to develop the brand on a global basis.\r\nOur other American whiskey brands, including Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, enjoyed fast rates of growth as our authentic American whiskey brands are well positioned to meet the rapidly increasing demand for high-quality premium-priced bourbon. Finlandia vodka's underlying net sales declined 2% year-to-date, driven by declines in Russia where fiscal 2016 got off to a sluggish start, though our results did improve during the second quarter. Poland, our largest volumetric market for the brand, registered slight growth. Southern Comfort family of brands saw underlying net sales decline 7%. While weakness in the United States was the driver of underperformance, the brand has seen positive takeaway trends in markets such as Germany, the United Kingdom and South Africa. Sonoma-Cutrer, Korbel and Chambord each grew underlying net sales by low single digits in the first half of the fiscal year.\r\nNow let me circle back to our tequila brands, which have been delivering accelerating rates of growth over the last year. During the first half of the fiscal year, el Jimador's global underlying net sales grew 8%, Herradura grew 7% and New Mix jumped 31%. New Mix's takeaway trends are showing solid growth year-to-date, and underlying sales were also helped by low trade inventory levels at the beginning of the fiscal year. These aggregate results were well balanced by geography, with 15% underlying net sales growth in the United States and 10% growth in markets outside of the United States. We believe that our tequila brands are early in their development in the United States as consumers are increasingly interested in 100% agave tequilas, particularly ones with the heritage and authenticity of our Casa Herradura family of brands. \r\nI'd like to take a moment and look at Herradura's recent momentum in the United States, an extremely important market for the brand, and to share with you some of the drivers of these strong results. First, let's look at our outperformance, where during the last 12 months, ultra-premium tequila has grown value by roughly 14%. Herradura has been gaining share, with Nielsen takeaway growing 16% over the same period. We believe this growth has been driven by a combination of factors, including the first large-scale media campaign behind the brand since 2007, which helped drive faster velocity and established accounts as well as distribution gains. Thoughtful innovations such as the introduction of Herradura Ultra and ultra-premium priced filter añejo tequila is also helping us better address the high-energy occasions. We believe the runway is long for this brand as brand awareness among our target consumers is only 1/4 of Patrón.\r\nEl Jimador has also been growing nicely in the United States, with consumer takeaway on a value basis accelerating from 14% over the last 12 months to 19% over the most recent 3-month period. This is double the premium tequila category's rate of growth as new packaging and more effective on-premise activations are fueling off-premise trends through increasing brand awareness. We are optimistic about both of these brands' growth potential over the coming years, given the brands are early in their development in markets outside of the United States.\r\nLet me now reconcile to reported growth for the first 6 months of our fiscal year. A strengthening U.S. dollar continues to negatively impact our reported results. These FX headwinds dragged down our reported sales by 8 points during the first half of the fiscal year. After a brief pause over this summer, the U.S. dollar resumed its appreciation against other currencies, which will continue to dampen reported earnings growth over the near term. \r\nOur top line grew 6% on an underlying basis, fueled by almost equal contributions of volume growth and price/mix. Underlying gross profit grew in line with sales growth, up 6% as better price/mix was offset by higher costs in the first half. We expect the rate of cost increases particularly related to wood to ease in the back half and help drive modestly better gross margins for the full year. \r\nUnderlying A&P spend increased 1% while underlying SG&A grew 3%. So putting this all together, we delivered 9% underlying operating income growth in the first half of fiscal 2015. Foreign exchange headwinds hurt our reported operating income growth by 4 points, and lower inventory levels primarily related to Tennessee Fire pulled another 3 points from our reported operating income. On our other income and expense line, we enjoyed favorable comparisons against last year's losses related to the revaluation of net current assets denominated in foreign currencies. For the first half of our fiscal year, we delivered reported earnings per share of $1.72. Adverse foreign exchange was a $0.07 drag on our EPS, a couple of cents worse than we had anticipated on our first quarter call.\r\nLet me now move to my second and final topic for this morning, an update on our outlook for fiscal 2016. Year-to-date, our top line growth of 6% and operating income growth of 9% are consistent with the results we delivered in fiscal 2015. This growth reflects the strength of our premium portfolio, focused on American whiskey and led by the Jack Daniel's family of brands. Our brands are enjoying broad-based global demand, evidenced by the balanced geographic delivery of our results through the first half of the fiscal year. Additionally, disciplined innovation has allowed us to attract and target new consumers and drinking occasions.\r\nSo while we're in the middle of the all-important OND selling season, would drive this proportionate amount of our annual sales, we are encouraged by the balanced geographic growth we have delivered so far in fiscal 2016 and are reconfirming the ranges we shared with you on our last call as we still anticipate full year underlying net sales growth of 6% to 7%. We also expect to deliver 8% to 10% growth in underlying operating income. Somewhat better gross margin expansion in the back half of the fiscal year will likely be partially offset by higher growth in our operating expenses, but we continue to expect solid leverage to the operating income line in fiscal 2016.\r\nMoving now to FX. Assuming current spot rates, we now expect adverse foreign exchange to be approximately $0.05 worse for the full year than we had anticipated on our first quarter call. As a sensitivity, assuming our foreign currency cash flow exposures collectively move 10% in either direction, our EPS over the balance of the year would be impacted by approximately $0.07.\r\nSo in summary, the first half of fiscal 2016 keeps us on track to deliver another year of strong growth. Notwithstanding the capital investments we have been making to ensure we are able to supply our growing base of consumers with our high-quality products, our operating cash flow has been strong and growing. This cash flow and balance sheet flexibility has allowed us to return significant capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Over the last 5 years, we have returned $3.6 billion to our shareholders, with almost $900 million alone during the first 6 months of this fiscal year as we aim to consistently deliver top-tier returns for our shareholders over the long term. \r\nSo with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul for his comments.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'll be pretty brief here. FX headwinds aside, I'm pleased with our first half underlying results, particularly the performance of our premium American whiskey portfolio, which, of course, is led by the Jack Daniel's family but was also bolstered by strong performances from both Woodford Reserve and Old Forester. \r\nAlso appreciated in the first half was broad and balanced geographic performance. In my view, this is the major asset for Brown-Forman and a very beneficial attribute of the company for investors. I will say that there is nothing easy about the current business environment, not that we ever expect it to be easy. At a time when the threat and reality of global terrorism is increasing, emerging market economies have softened somewhat and industry competition has intensified, particularly on the innovation front in the United States, I feel our underlying business continues to perform very well and notably very consistently. \r\nI'll make this point related to this consistency by noting that Brown-Forman's FY '15 full year results from last year saw a 6% growth in underlying net sales and a 9% growth in underlying operating income. With today's mid-year results, we have posted a 6% growth in underlying net sales and a 9% growth in underlying operating income. Further, in confirming our full year EPS guidance this morning, we are anticipating that underlying sales and operating growth will roughly continue at these same attractive rates. And if they do, we estimate that Brown-Forman's underlying results will continue to compare quite favorably to our spirits competition.\r\nSo while we still have the last half to navigate, and this includes our important holiday season, I'm pleased with where we are at this year's midpoint. I will also note that our earliest read on November's business, which, of course, was not part of this morning's first half results, is quite positive and serves to further strengthen our confidence in our underlying growth outlook. \r\nBefore closing, I'd like to note one other item that I believe reflects Brown-Forman's ongoing progress as well as our belief in the continued growth prospects for the company, and that was our announcement to increase the annual dividend by another 8% in calendar year 2016. This marks the 32nd consecutive year that the company has increased its annual dividend, and this, I believe, stands as another testament to the consistency to which I'm referring. \r\nThank you. Those will conclude our prepared remarks this morning, and we're now happy to take any of your questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Jason Koval (Executives)】\nThanks, Selena, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank you for joining us for Brown-Forman's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Paul Varga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jane Morreau, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Fitzgerald, Chief Accounting Officer.\r\nThis morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. \r\nYou should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements whether due to new information, future events or otherwise. This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The release can be found on our website under the section titled Investor Relations. In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operation are contained in the press release. \r\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Jane for her prepared remarks.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nThanks, Jay, and thanks for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I will be covering 2 topics today, which should leave us plenty of time to address Q&A. First, I'll review our results; and second, I'll discuss our outlook for fiscal 2016, which we confirmed earlier today.\r\nSo let me start by reviewing our recent results. During the first half of fiscal 2016, we grew underlying net sales by 6%. This underlying sales growth was broad-based geographically, with mid- to high single-digit rates of growth in both the developed and emerging markets. In the United States, underlying net sales grew 7% during the first 6 months of the fiscal year. These results were led by the Jack Daniel's family of brands, which grew underlying net sales by 7%. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire contributed almost 3 points of growth in the United States. Our leading portfolio of premium whiskey brands outpaced their competitive set, including aggregate underlying net sales growth of over 30% for the Woodford Reserve family of brands and Old Forester. Our el Jimador and Herradura tequila brands grew well into double digits as the brand building investments we have been making behind both of these leading tequilas are creating important momentum towards achieving our long-term growth strategies. More on those in just a moment.\r\nBefore moving on to our non-U.S. markets, I wanted to share some color on our blended value takeaway trends in the United States for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. Both Nielsen and NABCA's 3-month trends have slowed as we are now comping against last fall's substantial acceleration and takeaway on the heels of the campaign in fiscal 2015 to reach the 5 million case milestone for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. When looking at our takeaway trends on a 2-year basis, which removed short-term comparison issues, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey has consistently grown value takeaway at a very healthy 9% to 10% rate each month this calendar year when compared to 2013.\r\nIn developed markets outside of the United States, the rate of underlying net sales growth improved from the first quarter to the second quarter, resulting in 6% growth during the first half of the fiscal year. Results were up double digits in Germany, France, Belgium and the Czech Republic. Additionally, we experienced solid growth in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Spain. Part of the sequential improvement was also due to Australia, which enjoyed more favorable comparisons than in the first quarter, resulting in first half underlying net sales that were roughly flat year-over-year.\r\nUnderlying net sales in emerging markets grew 8% year-to-date. Strong double-digit gains in Brazil, Turkey, emerging Africa and the CIS countries were offset by declines in China and in Southeast Asia. Mexico grew underlying net sales mid-single digits fueled by New Mix. Poland also experienced growth albeit driven in part by easy comps to last year. Russia's underlying results improved significantly from the first quarter large declines, resulting in now only a slight reduction in year-to-date underlying net sales.\r\nNon-U.S. markets now account for almost 60% of our total revenue, so I thought it would be worthwhile to share some additional color on takeaway trends for some of the markets outside of the United States where we have good visibility. Three-month consumer takeaway trends for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey are up mid-single digits in Germany, France and in Australia. The brand is experiencing mid-single-digit growth in Mexico and is growing high teens in Russia. While Poland is down over the most recent 3 months, we are gaining share in whiskey, and Jack Daniel's is up high teens over the last 12 months. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey is also experiencing a short-term slowdown in the United Kingdom takeaway, driven in part by timing of promotional activities, but 12-month value takeaway is up 10%. So these consumer trends are encouraging as we think about our full year outlook.\r\nGlobal Travel Retail, which accounted for approximately 4% of our stripped net sales in fiscal 2015, continues to be challenging, driven by the decline in spend from high-income travelers, particularly Russian and European. Travel retail's underlying net sales are down 14% year-to-date, a slight improvement from the first quarter but well below our expectations for the business.

      "transcript_text3": "First, just wanted to get an update on kind of the positive offset to keep full year EPS guidance the same despite the incremental FX hit. Is there something specific on the positive side giving you confidence there? Is it more related to having a range around earnings and maybe where you land in that range is a bit different? And then second, Paul, was just hoping for some more detail on the competitive pressures you cite in the U.S. around innovation. How big a concern is that going forward as flavored whiskeys proliferate? Obviously, you guys have been very successful with the flavored products so far. But do you worry competitive risk ramps up going forward as some of your competitors catch up to you? And it looks like a number of the Canadian whiskey brands are kind of revitalizing themselves as they move into the flavored products. So how big of a risk is that and how do you manage through that?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you. Jane, you want to take the first one, I'll tackle the [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nLet me take this -- yes, I'll take the first. So your question was really around what our full year outlook, and really the biggest change that's happened from what we gave you back in June and what we've reconfirmed in August and what we're saying today is FX. And so excluding FX, I think we're -- as we confirmed today, we're on track for this top line 6% to 7% growth and the bottom line 9% to 10% -- 8% to 10% growth. So the only change has been FX, and FX is -- still fall within the range that we gave you.\n\n---\n\nYes. And to Dara's question related to competition. Let me just -- this is something we started to emphasize a bit more at the conclusion of our first quarter when we were discussing results. So let me just maybe build on that a little more. I think this reference to competition. I mean, look, companies always have competition. So it's not like that's new. I think the thing that I would emphasize, and I might break it down particularly as I think your question related to the United States, which is one of the most competitive markets just because of the structure of the system and the ability to innovate within it, which is both, of course, a blessing and a curse, depending upon which end you're on. So when I think about what's been happening in the last sort of 6 months or so in the United States, going back a few years, many of the really global competitors had more -- what I'd say more balanced geographic earnings profiles than some of them have enjoyed here more recently. And if you think back 4, 5 years ago, a lot of people were dependent on the emerging markets for growth whereas their developed international markets may not have been growing as robustly. And in the U.S. they could expect maybe industry competitive levels of growth, but the emerging markets were really helping drive them. And obviously, what we've seen from a number of our competition is that's just more difficult these days. So I think a lot of them are turning to a very attractive U.S. market where innovation is possible. It's a very premium market so the ability to influence your margins, and the growth of your company is probably a little more rapid in the United States just because of the structure and profile of the market. And so these are good competitors, and they want to grow. And so as we sort of forecasted back in the first quarter, we expected levels of increased competition just generally to go up. So I think that is an influence on one level. So you got highly motivated competitors who want to grow at rates kind of like Brown-Forman's, right? I think the other thing is just the existence of this flavored whiskey phenomenon that's going on. And so what we've seen is a lot of different strategies people are deploying for trying to be successful in that particular segment. And for us, for example, I'll just heighten the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey competition. And I think this will kind of help on Dara's question. Just in the last year what we've seen, whereas the category was really developed along the lines of primarily cinnamon and honey with just a little bit of cherry-flavored whiskey out there. What you see just 12 months later is the development of both an apple-flavored segment, which increases competition but also for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey has been more, what I'll call, popular price competition whereas we held sort of the premium position within the Honey segment, now there are new competitors in there that are at lower prices. So I think we've started to see that within particularly cinnamon apple and honey stratification between popular and premium price leadership. And so when we refer to intensifying competition, it's really along those lines. The things we'll continue to do, we talked about this in the first quarter, I think it continues to be our posture is that our great advantage in playing in flavored whiskey, I feel, today, is to be focused on fewer flavors but broader geography and less on lots of flavors and narrow geography. And so of course, a lot of the data that you observe and are interested in, which we are as well because it's become an important piece of the distilled spirits market in the United States, is this U.S. flavored whiskey segment. But I really continue to believe, and it's been our experience on Tennessee Honey that a lot of gold is there to be mined outside the United States. So it doesn't mean we don't have to compete in the United States, and we'll sharpen our sales and marketing efforts there. But I still continue to believe that while there's great runway ahead for the 2 flavors that we've got on the Jack Daniel's franchise and those opportunities exist both in the United States and overseas, we have really continued to have some advantage because of the strength of the Jack Daniel's trademark and our route to consumer around the world in developing beyond just 1 country. So that's the current way we're sort of thinking through this. I don't expect us to do this introduction of multiple flavors at one time or sometimes what people are referring to as sort of the flavor of the month thing. I just really think these -- we want to build these as Jack Daniel's brand extension.\n\n---\n\nI'm just kind of building -- not to belabor the point but just building off of that. On the flavor commentary, we do have examples in other categories, vodka, maybe even craft beer, where the consumer does kind of jump from one flavor to the next, looking for the next thing consistently. And I'm interested in your commentary around focusing on fewer flavors. What is the risk that the consumer just moves away from the flavors that you've emphasized? And is there anything different about the whiskey category that's unlike vodka or beer, or these other categories which have been a little bit more fickle as we look forward in the sustainability of this growth? And then secondly, digging into that even further, how do you view the flavor phenomenon impacting the core Jack Daniel's style? And are you -- do you feel you're cannibalizing the core brand? And will consumers come back into that brand if they do move away for some of the flavor expressions?\n\n---\n\nAll right. Good question. Yes, I mean, I think the data would show that people are showing an interest in flavored variety. I think the key to not being susceptible to dramatic declines in your volume, it goes to, one, the strength of the trademark; two, the quality of the product offering itself and continuing to offer a product that really holds up in the glass, I think, is really critical to this because not all of them will; and then just the way that you sell and market the brand. You just don't want it to be actually feel like sometimes, and it's often a reaction to short-term conditions, studying something maybe perhaps that happened last month or in the last 12 weeks or 6 months. The reality is to really treat these things as brand expressions and continue -- I mean, for us, the size of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey today, I mean, it is a pretty significant brand on a global scale. I think we've mentioned this from time to time. I mean, there's fewer than 20 brands that we know of that are at its price point and above 1 million cases globally. So we don't treat it as sort of, like what I'd call flavored extension from which we've now got to go replicate it over and over again. I think that can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. On the balancing act of cannibalization versus what I'll call the gateway of introducing someone through say, Tennessee Honey or Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire to the whiskey category where they might not have been a participant in the past. And we are seeing, I think, really nice evidence of, particularly now with the passage of time, because they've got more data on Honey, it's newer still on Tennessee Fire. But it actually exposes people to the Jack Daniel's brand in such a positive way. And it's a way for them to sort of build their palate toward the appreciation of what I'll call straight whiskey. And so I feel like yes, you can accept modest levels of early cannibalization to the extent it exists. I mean, we've been very comfortable thus far with both of the expressions at the level of cannibalization. You expect a little bit, and frankly, we feel like on Tennessee Fire, just because of the shot nature of that occasion, that it has potential to do a little bit more cannibalization than Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey did, although both are what I consider to be modest and acceptable levels and more than offset by the potential gateway and marketing value they create. So as people -- the way I like to think about it is as people switch flavors, as you say, one of the things that we expect is that they switch flavors from, say, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire to Jack Daniel's Black Label. So and I just don't anticipate us getting caught up in a very exhaustive flavor-by-flavor exercise. And so from time to time, compared to other people who are building distribution or getting trial with any number of flavors, we're just going to have to deal with it. And so the way we would be successful is to focus on the flavors we have and try to get them to be as successful in the marketplace that they can, and I continue to think a huge piece of that for us is a global marketplace versus just the U.S. marketplace.\n\n---\n\nPerfect. And if I could just ask one quick follow-up. It looks like your price/mix accelerated pretty nicely in the second quarter. I assume that's predominantly, if not wholly, on the mix side. I'm curious what the puts and takes were there. If it was an acceleration in some of our premium product selling through or a slowdown and maybe some of the more value products. And how we should think about this for the back half of the year on the price/mix side.\n\n---\n\nSure, I'll take that. So just talk about the split on the price/mix. It was more mix, as you said, than price. I think it's 1/3, 2/3, if you will, or in that range. And it was driven, as we looked through it, it was driven by definitely higher growth from our premium portfolio of brands, so our Woodford Reserves, our Jack Daniel's family of brands definitely contributed. To a lesser extent, we did have some of our lower-margin products not do as well, Finlandia and Canadian Mist, those that, to a large extent, it was due to the premiumization of our products. As we look forward in terms of the rest of the year, as we were consistent and throughout the year, we're not really expecting much from pricing the whole year, very modest pricing. And so anything that we get will be more mix-related. I think at the beginning of the year, we said it was going to be in a couple of percentage points is the message that we've had. So I would assume that it will stay in the 2% to 3% range for price/mix in totality.\n\n---\n\nJust a modeling question to start and then a real question. So do you wish your repurchase target for the year exhibits much higher than we thought or at least modeled for the quarter? And then also CapEx is a lower than we thought given all the initiatives you guys are doing. And then lastly, your comfort level on the leverage ratio, kind of where you think you could sort of take it and still be within your comfort zone. And then any sort of commentary on divestitures or acquisitions because there's obviously been some stuff in the press about some of the brands you may or may not be parting ways with.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, you asked a lot of questions. I'm not sure if I [indiscernible] but I'm going to do the -- what was your specific question, would you mind saying on the share repo again? It was...\n\n---\n\nDo you have a share repo target for the year? Because it came in much higher in the quarter than we thought, yes.\n\n---\n\nYes, we don't target a share repo for you all. I remind you that we have a $1.25 billion authorized share repurchase that was effective last March 24, I believe, and we've repurchased about $1 billion against that, so we got $250 million, $250 million or so left on that initial approval, if you will. But the way we approach share repurchases are opportunistically, so we're looking at those in investment. And so as when you saw us buy a significant amount in our second quarter where we felt like the market wasn't real understanding in realizing some of the underlying growth that we see in our business and how we see it going forward and it was being masked somewhat by foreign exchange. So but we don't have a target for that for the year, if you will. So it's more of an opportunistic as several factors go into play when we do it, both the price of the stock, what we -- our own needs of our business are, so funding to our own business, whole host of things that go into that. So but we do have about $250 million left on it. In terms of the CapEx, you did see it. It's lagging where we thought it was going to be for the year. We expected it to be about $200 million for the year. I think some of it is going to get shifted to next year. So right now, we're expecting somewhere in the $150 million, $160 million range for the year. So it's timing only. So we'll be pushed in to next year. And when we get done with all of our capital expenditures, the major ones behind expanding our distillery, adding the cooperage through mills, adding bottling, we'll have spent well in excess of $300 million on those expenditures. And then you asked a question about...\n\n---\n\nThe leverage ratio.\n\n---\n\nCoverage ratio, which we don't -- we're very comfortable at the levels that we're at right now. I mean, as you all would know from following us, we have a pretty conservative posture about that. Historically, some of it's just what opportunities come along, it's not that we're not willing. I will say that in addition to what Jane said there that the attractive borrowing rates, paired with the long-term prospects we feel for the company, combine to motivate us a little bit on the share repurchase activity. Right now, the ability to -- if you just think about it for a very, very long-term investment to buy back shares today and to have a view of the company in the way that we do as managers and then just be able to support it with very low price debt today by historical terms is a wonderful combination of factors. And I'll just -- to boot, I mean, you're always looking at what your alternative investments might be. And as we scour the world and think about the things we can invest in, investing our own business is right near the top. So and that occurs both through the CapEx that Jane mentioned but also through the share repurchase program. And then, you had also mentioned about rumors in the marketplace. And as we -- is our typical posture, we have just been really well served by not commenting on rumors that are out there related to things that we might either be -- somebody's prospecting that we might be selling our bang. And we just really appreciate the fact that over the years, the no comment on that has served us well. So we'll continue to hold by that today.\n\n---\n\nYes, I totally respect that. And then just on the more business side of things, I mean, how do you balance market share versus profitability? Because if I look at the U.S. data and admittedly, the data set is pretty limited for us because we really only have the Nielsen data to go on. But it looks like the incumbent brands are losing quite a bit of market share at least year-over-year on the whiskey and bourbon side. And you have pretty substantial share growth from Bulleit and then that all other category, which probably some of your brands are there as well. But it seems like that's accelerating a little bit and I know the margin mix obviously is improving quite a bit with Woodford and some of the other variants. So how do you guys kind of manage that? And how important is that market share data? And then again, I know it's a short period of time so maybe it's just not a broad enough data set.\n\n---\n\nIt's important to study, I think, over time to make -- I think mostly to make sure that the opportunities you see for your company you're not letting others have. Although I will say it's been my experience in this business to be more growth-oriented and not size- or share-oriented. We be typically don't set scale-based or size-based ambitions relative to competitors for our company. And I -- because I think that can lead to oftentimes the wrong sets of behaviors. And I mean it's not that it's not useful, we're as competitive as the next person so we like to look at share data. But I think the criticality of growth and enduring growth is what we've continued to focus on. And so I mean, I really don't feel like we lose sleep like, for example, I mean, it's been -- it will be a fact with the size of the Jack Daniel's Black Label business in the United States, it will have a very difficult time growing at the growth rate that Woodford Reserve is. I mean, it's just -- it's at an earlier stage of development. So what we tend to do when we look at share data is we look at it with and without Jack Daniel's. We look at it in ways that can inform us and illuminate where there might be growth opportunities for us. And I actually -- I mean, but we are competitive. I will tell you that we want, like for example, at the price point above Jack Daniel's in the U.S. American whiskey market, we want to be a leader. We want to have our fair share of it. That doesn't mean we would do anything at any cost to be the #1 volumetric player at the ultra-premium level. But I will tell you that we really feel like that's an area that we know well. We have the assets, the production assets, and the know-how to be part of that. So and the same thing is true of flavored whiskey. It'd be rare for you to hear us say something like we need to be #1 in flavored whiskey in the United States. That's -- just not compelled by that, and I don't think our company is. We don't like to see other people get consumption that we don't have. But when you have, as our company does today in our largest markets, something like a 6% or 5% market share, and when you have on across the globe less than 1% of the market share, you're going to be really frustrated for a long time if you measure yourself on that basis. So we think we can be an enormously successful company building value for shareholders without having to dominate any particular category or segment.\n\n---\n\nJane, so on your full year underlying sales guidance, I know you're continuing to stick to the 6% to 7%. You did 6% year-to-date, I guess, last year, you also did 6%. And if I kind of look at the fourth quarter comps being pretty tough and U.S. comps are probably going to be tougher in the next quarter or so. So I'm just wondering, I know it's 100 basis points to get to the high end of it, but are there anything in the back half that you expect some acceleration, whether it's markets or brands that gives you some confidence that actually we could see some acceleration in the back half?\n\n---\n\nYes. So great questions, and again we're looking at our full-year forecasts and we do see, as Paul already alluded to, getting off to a good start in November. So we are seeing an acceleration from that perspective, and so we're expecting -- we had a pretty soft third quarter last year. And so we are expecting soft comps against that or easier comps against that quarter and expect that to be a good quarter for us. You did point out that we did have a nice quarter in the fourth quarter last year with the rollout -- the national rollout of Tennessee Fire in the U.S. But we also have some markets in overseas that we've been testing, not that we're rolling them out further, but we've got further tests to do in some of those markets, so there will be some offset there too, so it won't be a one-for-one kind of thing if you're thinking about it's going out and we've got to cover it all. So but our full-year forecast anticipates all this, Judy. And we think the 6% to 7% range is acceptable and reachable, given the environment we're in currently.\n\n---\n\nJust following up on the November trend. So I know you guys had a pretty weak trend in Poland in the third quarter last year. So is the acceleration driven by Poland or are you seeing broad-based acceleration in November?\n\n---\n\nIt's pretty broad based right now.\n\n---\n\n,\r\nIt -- yes, it's early now but it looks broad-based. Poland's a top 10 market for us but it's rare that it would drive the entirety of Brown-Forman. So oftentimes, the numbers -- I mean, you can get that from sometimes the United States because of the size of it within Brown-Forman. And periodically, you'll get the U.K.'s or the France's and Germany's particularly when they combine. But right now, and again, it's early. We still got a lot to see but we're encouraged by what we've seen broad-based out of November.\n\n---\n\nI would just like to add one more thing to that and I alluded to it during my talk -- my script, Travel Retail. And it's still tough sledding there, if you will, but we do know that the U.S. Travel Retail business had some timing issues, and we kept waiting for them to come in, and we started to see them come through in November. And so we would -- are expecting the rate of decline in Travel Retail not to be what it is for the full year. Thus, we are expecting acceleration there from what we've had year-to-date, so that'll add to some of the growth. That's why we've been pointing out and pulling out Travel Retail, both in the first quarter and the second quarter to show what it actually has done to our growth rate and it's been fairly significant in both the year-to-date as well as our first and second quarter.\n\n---\n\nThe other thing I'll mention is I think the Travel Retail piece, I mean, we still have some determinations to make inside the company as it relates to geographic expansion on Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, so we'll be getting to those here in the next probably few weeks or so. But the other thing is as the calendar year turns, once we enter into 2016, it marks actually the year where the Jack Daniel's distillery will begin to celebrate its 150th anniversary. So you can imagine that a company like Brown-Forman, it's a great milestone. And I don't know how much impact that would have on this fiscal year, but it's something that we expect to be something that's really nice mobilizing event for the calendar year 2016 period. And you can -- I mean, you can imagine us having a lot of fun with that but also consumers getting to have a lot of fun with it as well. So we'll be talking probably a little more specifically about that with passage of time, maybe a little bit more at the end of Q3. But that's another point I'd note.\n\n---\n\nGot it, okay. And then Paul, I know obviously, you said you don't want to comment on any of the market speculation about M&A. But if I just kind of look at your portfolio, and it sounds like you're definitely stepping up your focus on the premium tequila with the Herradura brand, and that makes perfect sense. But as you think about your broader portfolio and thinking about some of the declining brands and sort of the lower margin businesses, what are kind of the puts and takes of -- from a strategic standpoint, of keeping those brands so that you have scale versus perhaps maybe pruning some of the portfolio so you can focus your portfolio to really be more of a whiskey premium tequila brand portfolio even if there is some potential dilution in earnings?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, our -- I think our portfolio management generally across time, I mean, I think you could just observe it. I think it's stood the test of time. I mean, we've increasingly become more premium and more whiskey would be the observations if you go all the way back to the consumer durables days and wine. But I think it would be evident that when we even chose to exit wines, we chose to stay in Sonoma-Cutrer. So we find that our -- I mean, it's just that we have found the benefit of focusing on fewer trademarks that are excellent businesses that have great growth profiles. And the story of Brown-Forman today is that -- a lot of companies will have brands that are smaller in terms of their contribution in the modern day than they might have been 5 or 10 years ago, and we always talk about it -- if the company's Old Forester that here it's enjoying remarkable success both on and off-premise. But it's a little brand still in the scale of Brown-Forman and probably endured about a 50-year decline. And so I guess you could call that patience. We waited for it to get small enough that it could be termed craft and retro and all these other things that it's enjoying this renaissance that it is today. So there's an example of staying with brands. And I really do feel when you take Brown-Forman's portfolio overall and compare it to many of our competitors out there, I mean, we just have one of, if not the most focused portfolios in the spirits industry and I do think we benefit from that. So but as, again, going back I think it was in your preface, we just don't comment on things that either are incoming or potentially outgoing. It's just not -- just doesn't serve us well, and so we let the rumors be the rumors and we keep focused on our business. I know some of you all -- I mean, people have speculated, I will say I'm really encouraged by, there's some recent marketing on the Southern Comfort brand that is literally, I mean, occurring in the last week or so where some viral advertising, I'll call it, associated with Danny McBride has gone out there, and Spotify is noting it as one of the top 10 sort of viral efforts in the United States. It's actually gone global as well. So there's -- I think that's evidence that the brand continues to get support and we continue to try to put our best foot forward in a really competitive environment.\n\n---\n\nNot to belabor the competition point too much, but wanted to approach it from a different angle. Paul, last quarter, you made the distinction between increased competition for shelf space at retail and back bar space on premise as opposed to competition, price competition, either at retail or on-premise, saying you had clearly seen a pickup in the former, but the latter was kind of in line with historical trends. Wondering whether you could update us on that particularly, price competition in the off-premise? We've seen some hot price points from particular markets. And then related to that, in response to Dara's question, you mentioned some popularly priced flavored whiskeys. I'm just wondering whether you're seeing more or less or the same discounting of sort of the premium core brands from your competitors. So 2 related questions.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think -- I mean, I think it's fair for us to comment on it. Certainly, there's 2 forms that we're seeing, just to go back and be clear. There are 2 forms of the competitive effort. One is level of entries into the marketplace. There was something in the internal report we were looking at here just this week where, and this is a pretty interesting statistic, in the United States, in the U.S. alone, whiskey market above the $20 price point, so $20 price point above, over the last 4 years, more than 500 new entrants. So there's that -- that would be, now where are you going to put all those? I mean, there's shelf space, back bar. And of course, I mean, that those are, in many instances, highly regional. So you're not -- those aren't going to be full-blown national brands immediately unless they're large trademark line extensions, which have the capacity to do that. But in addition to that, I mean, I don't know, I almost feel like every year for the last 10, around October, November, December, we start to observe increased price competition. And I mean, it differs from brand to brand or company to company, it feels like every year, but I don't know that this year is any more competitive than 2014 was or 2013. I always feel like both anecdotally and when you study the data after the fact, some brands chose to go deep on their 175 or to put RRCs [ph] or coupons out there. I mean, just it all depends on the motivation of those particular competitors. So we have seen some spread difference in the U.S. market between say, Jack Daniel's and Jim Beam. We've seen -- and that would be an example for this year. But in prior years, we've seen other brands go deep on discounting. And all of it is just a reminder of the balancing act. I actually think one of the things that will be interesting to see over the -- this is not a comment about 2015, but as I look out at 2016, '17 and '18, some of this will be dependent upon the stocks available. If these rates of growth for the category continue and these entrants continue to go in and -- we never a have quite good enough feel for how much supply is actually out there. And so if demand outstrips supply out there, I think you'll start to see pricing go up, not down, with sort of rational competitors. So we don't have any indication of that now, but I mean, this growth rates have been running pretty solid for a while now in the industry. And I think that can be an influence to the pricing and the pricing competitiveness out there.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And just as a follow-up, Jane. Wondering whether you can give us any more color or an update in terms of the COGS inflation. I think last quarter, you were talking about 2% to 3% per -- for the year. I believe last quarter, you talked about some moderation in wood that would happen in the second quarter. It now looks like that's more pushed to the second half. Just wondering whether I'm remembering that correctly or if you could give us an update there as to what happened.\n\n---\n\nYes, sure. So I still think we still would expect COGS somewhere in the 3% range for the year. But in terms of what I've said -- I don't know if I referred to the second quarter or not but let's just focus on the wood as we go forward. We are expecting a moderation in the rate of increase to occur over the back half of the year. That's one of the big drivers of the increase of the COGS growing a little bit faster than it has historically for us. And the reason why it's going to moderate is because last year at this time, the cost of logs, the cost of saves, the cost of headings, if you will, all components that go into making a barrel took a pretty significant increase. And it's continued to increase, but the rate of increase over the balance of year is expected to moderate.\n\n---\n\nYes. So going a little bit back to that earlier question, any price/mix benefit that we would have been seeing through the year is being offset somewhat by some of those higher wood costs. As we start to cycle them, we'll get more benefit from our price/mix in that second half because we're cycling a higher base. So that is a positive for the company in that second half.\n\n---\n\nPaul, I was wondering if you can help confirm something we recently picked up in the trade regarding Bacardi putting its distribution out to RFP, breaking the alliance with Remy and Brown-Forman, and if that is true, what would be the implications if the distribution alliance actually broke up? Would that benefit you or would that hurt you? Any thoughts on that would be helpful.\n\n---\n\nWell, it'd be premature to even assess that. I mean, we are aware that there are some RFPs out there if Bacardi has initiated, but as far as we know, we're continuing to partner with them in the same ways that we have historically in the United States. And just remember, there's part of that partnership we do altogether and the respective companies go and do their individual brand building work and then within each company, people building their own individual brands. So I mean, I think no matter what happens, and I always feel this way about the U.S. environment, whether it's wholesale consolidation, supplier consolidation, people changing distributor alignments, et cetera. I really have a high level of confidence in Brown-Forman's ability to navigate the U.S. system. I really do. We do that. We really don't have a one single way of doing it in the United States. There's some literally 50 different ways you can go-to-market in the United States. And so I just like the flexibility, along with the stability that comes from Brown-Forman's historical approach to the U.S. distribution system. And so we really do -- have always -- there's still a lot of markets where we go to the marketplace with Bacardi, not only in the United States but outside of the United States us well. So where that's appropriate, we'll continue to do it.\n\n---\n\nJust to recapitulate something you said a few minutes ago, but I think it bears kind thinking a little bit more about. Consumer behavior in alcoholic beverages has always shown a tendency to more complex flavors and more crafted favors, if you will, light beer drinkers go to beer drinkers, become craft beer drinkers and so on. And so I mean, I think it really is the right way to think about it to think that the best thing about Tennessee Fire is Jack Daniel's Black Label. The best thing about Jack Daniel's Black Label is Woodford Reserve or Gentleman Jack. Am I thinking about that right over a kind of 10-year outlook?\n\n---\n\nI mean, yes, I think that's one aspect of it, Tim. I think there's a phenomenon that's really interesting in the, call it spirits category relative to -- we often get compared to beer or wine. So one observation along the lines of what you're thinking is just first to ground you. Remember that the core offering of distilled spirits more often than not, it's consumed in its final format in a varied or flavored or mixed way. So it's even more natural in my view for flavored spirits to exist In some forms, it's providing convenience. In other forms, it's providing a little more prepared form of what they ultimately enjoy anyway. So and that's not true. I mean, beer is not an ingredient in a broader base beverage, for example. So I think that's one thing to think about, which I think bodes well for the longer run. The 2 factors that I think will make flavored whiskey have a longer life versus shorter are that it's inherently the way the core whiskey category gets consumed anyway. And two is that they are aged products that have a moderating and regulating mechanism to the boom bust phenomenon that can happen. I think those are 2 contributing factors that, they don't guarantee that some brands won't go away or there won't be some bubble or something like that. But for our business, it's why we believe that they can be very strong enduring brands. Then the other piece is what you're talking about, which is the -- and I'm just going to give you an anecdotal one because I saw it over the last -- saw these last night. I mean, I'll give you an example, my wife, who literally does not drink whiskey and never has. And with the introduction of Tennessee Honey and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, I mean, literally, I mean, she said, \"Well, that really tastes good, for example, on the rocks.\" And literally over the Thanksgiving holiday, she was stealing my Gentleman Jack on the rocks. I mean, so here is an example of somebody who's developed a palate over a period of time, so that -- somebody who never would have been interested in the category. And I think is an example of what you're referring to. Now whether or not she'll trade up to Woodford Reserve or Double Oaked, I don't know. But in any event, I think there's real foundation to the premise that you suggested there.\n\n---\n\nYes. At the end of the day, the ultra-premium is kind of where everybody is going. They might get stuck along the way, but they might end up going there.\n\n---\n\nTim, the other thing, it's a really affordable luxury. I mean, you can get, on a liter of, say, Woodford Reserve, you're getting -- there's 20 standard drinks in a liter of Woodford Reserve. And for the money compared to where you might put your entertainment dollar, particularly if you're entertaining people at home, it's a real value.\n\n---\n\nJust a quick question on barrel making. I mean, you do all that in-house, I believe. And so other than just the raw material costs, as you expand barrel-making activity, should we think about that sort of diluting COGS from higher depreciation and so on? Or should we think about that as a benefit to COGS from greater efficiencies? How would we think about that?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, we're definitely building our new -- all of our new facilities with a couple things in mind. One, to make them as efficient and effective as possible; and two, make them scalable, so we're not necessarily building it to be double what we need today, we're building it and scaling it as we go. So I think the answer is sort of in the middle, there will definitely be some incremental depreciation as time goes on from some of the investments we're making, but we're also being very thoughtful in terms of how much we're investing now to minimize overproducing -- over constructing and over making something that we don't need at this point.\n\n---\n\nYes, a couple things I think in addition to what Jane's saying there is, just remember from a traditional economies of scale thing. I mean, barrel making, you don't run this down the line in the way that you get that ramped up with [indiscernible]. I mean, these are made by people, human beings. I mean, so that's one of the tricks of the barrel making operation. The -- I mean, we do get some benefit I think on a little bit, probably on freight because we're down closer. The new cooperage is a little closer to Jack, which is the primary customer. I mean, a lot of it would depend too on how you account for which, the used barrel sales a little bit. And do you count that as efficiency or do you count that as a sale. And of course, we've been benefiting from the used barrel sales these last couple of years because the market's been so buoyant. So a lot of it depends on how you account for that aspect of it. I will say the other piece that relates to that is it really was in part a, I'll call it a risk mitigation move by the company to ensure we had 2 cooperages spaced in different locations, et cetera. So Tim, as we we've learned that long ago with warehouses and other aspects of the businesses, but it was really was -- bought some insurance for us as well because our business is so attractive, we would not want to be -- have any limitations as it relates to getting wood.\n\n---\n\nYes, I would just say anecdotally in wine, used barrel prices are up 100% because there's so much demand from craft distillers and craft beer makers who want to put the beer in oak, so.\n\n---\n\nYou bet.\n\n---\n\nThat's one of the reasons why the cost just of our own wood that we were procuring went up because some of the wood was going to the beer and -- the craft beer.\n\n---\n\nA lot of competition for people.\n\n---\n\nA lot of competition, yes.\n\n---\n\nThey want to use coopers.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple things just on the cost front I just wanted to clarify. You had said wood prices would get better in the back half. I mean, is that a sort of a longer-term trend as we move into kind of '17? Or is that just very small changes on year-over-year?\n\n---\n\nBill, that's actually what I was referring to is a year-over-year comparison. So the rate of change that we have experienced in the first half of the year versus -- is abating over the rest of the year. It's not that the costs themselves are coming down at this point because of supply-demand, the demand for it is still outstripping the supply.\n\n---\n\nThey're just comping the higher pace. They're just -- in the second half. They started to go up in the second half of last year, so they won't -- you won't have that negative impact as you did in the first half.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then I kind of missed the commentary. You had said also SG&A would kind of accelerate faster in the back half. Is there something behind that in terms of like marketing advertising? Or is that just kind of the normal flow?\n\n---\n\nI was referring to operating expenses. So if you look at our first -- operating expenses in the first half of the year, they were up modestly and lot of it's due to easy comps, if you will, versus last year. We had pretty high spending in the first half of last year. So we're flipping it in the second half so you have tougher comps, if you will. So that's all.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then last one just in all the competition, all the talk about price competition. Does this impact your kind of use of the goal of trying to raise price a couple percentage points every year as we look to kind of the June price increase?\n\n---\n\nWell, I don't know that we've ever had that programmatic an approach to it. I mean, I think we do like to try to advance prices, but we kind of do it -- I can recall now, we did some June and July pricing 3 years ago, yes, I think, yes, where we thought that was the right timing to do it. And not all markets did it then but a large number of them did. Sometimes, they're associated with input costs, other times they're associated more with price positioning, just the desire to continue to price the brands at the premium level around the world. So I mean, we'll probably be taking, here in the next, I don't know, 90 days, start to look at where our expectations would be for FY '17 as it relates to pricing, but we haven't -- don't have any early thoughts on that. We will continue to get -- I mean, as you sell -- I'll just use the example, as you sell more Woodford Reserve and sort of less Canadian Mist, you'll continue to get mix though. That'll continue to roll.\n\n---\n\nSure. But in terms of what you're saying, the current price competition in the U.S. doesn't alter your plans at this point?\n\n---\n\nI mean, you've got to look at it. I mean, the reality is, is that a lot of the competition I'm talking about is above the Jack Daniel's price point. So as it relates to Jack Daniel's, I mean, we're as motivated to make sure we're not seen as too lower-priced related to a lot of these new entrants because pricing in addition to being an economic tool is also a marketing tool in this business. So I just feel like we'll be weighing that as well as we do what the price spread is between us and say Jim Beam. I mean, we'll be looking at both factors.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Paul and Jane, and thanks to all of you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. And please feel free to reach out to us if you have any additional question. Thanks, and have a great week.\n\n---\n\nThank you all.\n\n---\n\nThanks.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Dara Mohsenian (Analysts)】\nFirst, just wanted to get an update on kind of the positive offset to keep full year EPS guidance the same despite the incremental FX hit. Is there something specific on the positive side giving you confidence there? Is it more related to having a range around earnings and maybe where you land in that range is a bit different? And then second, Paul, was just hoping for some more detail on the competitive pressures you cite in the U.S. around innovation. How big a concern is that going forward as flavored whiskeys proliferate? Obviously, you guys have been very successful with the flavored products so far. But do you worry competitive risk ramps up going forward as some of your competitors catch up to you? And it looks like a number of the Canadian whiskey brands are kind of revitalizing themselves as they move into the flavored products. So how big of a risk is that and how do you manage through that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you. Jane, you want to take the first one, I'll tackle the [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nLet me take this -- yes, I'll take the first. So your question was really around what our full year outlook, and really the biggest change that's happened from what we gave you back in June and what we've reconfirmed in August and what we're saying today is FX. And so excluding FX, I think we're -- as we confirmed today, we're on track for this top line 6% to 7% growth and the bottom line 9% to 10% -- 8% to 10% growth. So the only change has been FX, and FX is -- still fall within the range that we gave you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. And to Dara's question related to competition. Let me just -- this is something we started to emphasize a bit more at the conclusion of our first quarter when we were discussing results. So let me just maybe build on that a little more. I think this reference to competition. I mean, look, companies always have competition. So it's not like that's new. I think the thing that I would emphasize, and I might break it down particularly as I think your question related to the United States, which is one of the most competitive markets just because of the structure of the system and the ability to innovate within it, which is both, of course, a blessing and a curse, depending upon which end you're on. So when I think about what's been happening in the last sort of 6 months or so in the United States, going back a few years, many of the really global competitors had more -- what I'd say more balanced geographic earnings profiles than some of them have enjoyed here more recently. And if you think back 4, 5 years ago, a lot of people were dependent on the emerging markets for growth whereas their developed international markets may not have been growing as robustly. And in the U.S. they could expect maybe industry competitive levels of growth, but the emerging markets were really helping drive them. And obviously, what we've seen from a number of our competition is that's just more difficult these days. So I think a lot of them are turning to a very attractive U.S. market where innovation is possible. It's a very premium market so the ability to influence your margins, and the growth of your company is probably a little more rapid in the United States just because of the structure and profile of the market. And so these are good competitors, and they want to grow. And so as we sort of forecasted back in the first quarter, we expected levels of increased competition just generally to go up. So I think that is an influence on one level. So you got highly motivated competitors who want to grow at rates kind of like Brown-Forman's, right? I think the other thing is just the existence of this flavored whiskey phenomenon that's going on. And so what we've seen is a lot of different strategies people are deploying for trying to be successful in that particular segment. And for us, for example, I'll just heighten the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey competition. And I think this will kind of help on Dara's question. Just in the last year what we've seen, whereas the category was really developed along the lines of primarily cinnamon and honey with just a little bit of cherry-flavored whiskey out there. What you see just 12 months later is the development of both an apple-flavored segment, which increases competition but also for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey has been more, what I'll call, popular price competition whereas we held sort of the premium position within the Honey segment, now there are new competitors in there that are at lower prices. So I think we've started to see that within particularly cinnamon apple and honey stratification between popular and premium price leadership. And so when we refer to intensifying competition, it's really along those lines. The things we'll continue to do, we talked about this in the first quarter, I think it continues to be our posture is that our great advantage in playing in flavored whiskey, I feel, today, is to be focused on fewer flavors but broader geography and less on lots of flavors and narrow geography. And so of course, a lot of the data that you observe and are interested in, which we are as well because it's become an important piece of the distilled spirits market in the United States, is this U.S. flavored whiskey segment. But I really continue to believe, and it's been our experience on Tennessee Honey that a lot of gold is there to be mined outside the United States. So it doesn't mean we don't have to compete in the United States, and we'll sharpen our sales and marketing efforts there. But I still continue to believe that while there's great runway ahead for the 2 flavors that we've got on the Jack Daniel's franchise and those opportunities exist both in the United States and overseas, we have really continued to have some advantage because of the strength of the Jack Daniel's trademark and our route to consumer around the world in developing beyond just 1 country. So that's the current way we're sort of thinking through this. I don't expect us to do this introduction of multiple flavors at one time or sometimes what people are referring to as sort of the flavor of the month thing. I just really think these -- we want to build these as Jack Daniel's brand extension.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Marshall (Analysts)】\nI'm just kind of building -- not to belabor the point but just building off of that. On the flavor commentary, we do have examples in other categories, vodka, maybe even craft beer, where the consumer does kind of jump from one flavor to the next, looking for the next thing consistently. And I'm interested in your commentary around focusing on fewer flavors. What is the risk that the consumer just moves away from the flavors that you've emphasized? And is there anything different about the whiskey category that's unlike vodka or beer, or these other categories which have been a little bit more fickle as we look forward in the sustainability of this growth? And then secondly, digging into that even further, how do you view the flavor phenomenon impacting the core Jack Daniel's style? And are you -- do you feel you're cannibalizing the core brand? And will consumers come back into that brand if they do move away for some of the flavor expressions?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nAll right. Good question. Yes, I mean, I think the data would show that people are showing an interest in flavored variety. I think the key to not being susceptible to dramatic declines in your volume, it goes to, one, the strength of the trademark; two, the quality of the product offering itself and continuing to offer a product that really holds up in the glass, I think, is really critical to this because not all of them will; and then just the way that you sell and market the brand. You just don't want it to be actually feel like sometimes, and it's often a reaction to short-term conditions, studying something maybe perhaps that happened last month or in the last 12 weeks or 6 months. The reality is to really treat these things as brand expressions and continue -- I mean, for us, the size of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey today, I mean, it is a pretty significant brand on a global scale. I think we've mentioned this from time to time. I mean, there's fewer than 20 brands that we know of that are at its price point and above 1 million cases globally. So we don't treat it as sort of, like what I'd call flavored extension from which we've now got to go replicate it over and over again. I think that can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. On the balancing act of cannibalization versus what I'll call the gateway of introducing someone through say, Tennessee Honey or Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire to the whiskey category where they might not have been a participant in the past. And we are seeing, I think, really nice evidence of, particularly now with the passage of time, because they've got more data on Honey, it's newer still on Tennessee Fire. But it actually exposes people to the Jack Daniel's brand in such a positive way. And it's a way for them to sort of build their palate toward the appreciation of what I'll call straight whiskey. And so I feel like yes, you can accept modest levels of early cannibalization to the extent it exists. I mean, we've been very comfortable thus far with both of the expressions at the level of cannibalization. You expect a little bit, and frankly, we feel like on Tennessee Fire, just because of the shot nature of that occasion, that it has potential to do a little bit more cannibalization than Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey did, although both are what I consider to be modest and acceptable levels and more than offset by the potential gateway and marketing value they create. So as people -- the way I like to think about it is as people switch flavors, as you say, one of the things that we expect is that they switch flavors from, say, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire to Jack Daniel's Black Label. So and I just don't anticipate us getting caught up in a very exhaustive flavor-by-flavor exercise. And so from time to time, compared to other people who are building distribution or getting trial with any number of flavors, we're just going to have to deal with it. And so the way we would be successful is to focus on the flavors we have and try to get them to be as successful in the marketplace that they can, and I continue to think a huge piece of that for us is a global marketplace versus just the U.S. marketplace.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Marshall (Analysts)】\nPerfect. And if I could just ask one quick follow-up. It looks like your price/mix accelerated pretty nicely in the second quarter. I assume that's predominantly, if not wholly, on the mix side. I'm curious what the puts and takes were there. If it was an acceleration in some of our premium product selling through or a slowdown and maybe some of the more value products. And how we should think about this for the back half of the year on the price/mix side.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nSure, I'll take that. So just talk about the split on the price/mix. It was more mix, as you said, than price. I think it's 1/3, 2/3, if you will, or in that range. And it was driven, as we looked through it, it was driven by definitely higher growth from our premium portfolio of brands, so our Woodford Reserves, our Jack Daniel's family of brands definitely contributed. To a lesser extent, we did have some of our lower-margin products not do as well, Finlandia and Canadian Mist, those that, to a large extent, it was due to the premiumization of our products. As we look forward in terms of the rest of the year, as we were consistent and throughout the year, we're not really expecting much from pricing the whole year, very modest pricing. And so anything that we get will be more mix-related. I think at the beginning of the year, we said it was going to be in a couple of percentage points is the message that we've had. So I would assume that it will stay in the 2% to 3% range for price/mix in totality.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Schmitz (Analysts)】\nJust a modeling question to start and then a real question. So do you wish your repurchase target for the year exhibits much higher than we thought or at least modeled for the quarter? And then also CapEx is a lower than we thought given all the initiatives you guys are doing. And then lastly, your comfort level on the leverage ratio, kind of where you think you could sort of take it and still be within your comfort zone. And then any sort of commentary on divestitures or acquisitions because there's obviously been some stuff in the press about some of the brands you may or may not be parting ways with.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nOkay. Well, you asked a lot of questions. I'm not sure if I [indiscernible] but I'm going to do the -- what was your specific question, would you mind saying on the share repo again? It was...\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Schmitz (Analysts)】\nDo you have a share repo target for the year? Because it came in much higher in the quarter than we thought, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes, we don't target a share repo for you all. I remind you that we have a $1.25 billion authorized share repurchase that was effective last March 24, I believe, and we've repurchased about $1 billion against that, so we got $250 million, $250 million or so left on that initial approval, if you will. But the way we approach share repurchases are opportunistically, so we're looking at those in investment. And so as when you saw us buy a significant amount in our second quarter where we felt like the market wasn't real understanding in realizing some of the underlying growth that we see in our business and how we see it going forward and it was being masked somewhat by foreign exchange. So but we don't have a target for that for the year, if you will. So it's more of an opportunistic as several factors go into play when we do it, both the price of the stock, what we -- our own needs of our business are, so funding to our own business, whole host of things that go into that. So but we do have about $250 million left on it. In terms of the CapEx, you did see it. It's lagging where we thought it was going to be for the year. We expected it to be about $200 million for the year. I think some of it is going to get shifted to next year. So right now, we're expecting somewhere in the $150 million, $160 million range for the year. So it's timing only. So we'll be pushed in to next year. And when we get done with all of our capital expenditures, the major ones behind expanding our distillery, adding the cooperage through mills, adding bottling, we'll have spent well in excess of $300 million on those expenditures. And then you asked a question about...\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Schmitz (Analysts)】\nThe leverage ratio.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nCoverage ratio, which we don't -- we're very comfortable at the levels that we're at right now. I mean, as you all would know from following us, we have a pretty conservative posture about that. Historically, some of it's just what opportunities come along, it's not that we're not willing. I will say that in addition to what Jane said there that the attractive borrowing rates, paired with the long-term prospects we feel for the company, combine to motivate us a little bit on the share repurchase activity. Right now, the ability to -- if you just think about it for a very, very long-term investment to buy back shares today and to have a view of the company in the way that we do as managers and then just be able to support it with very low price debt today by historical terms is a wonderful combination of factors. And I'll just -- to boot, I mean, you're always looking at what your alternative investments might be. And as we scour the world and think about the things we can invest in, investing our own business is right near the top. So and that occurs both through the CapEx that Jane mentioned but also through the share repurchase program. And then, you had also mentioned about rumors in the marketplace. And as we -- is our typical posture, we have just been really well served by not commenting on rumors that are out there related to things that we might either be -- somebody's prospecting that we might be selling our bang. And we just really appreciate the fact that over the years, the no comment on that has served us well. So we'll continue to hold by that today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Schmitz (Analysts)】\nYes, I totally respect that. And then just on the more business side of things, I mean, how do you balance market share versus profitability? Because if I look at the U.S. data and admittedly, the data set is pretty limited for us because we really only have the Nielsen data to go on. But it looks like the incumbent brands are losing quite a bit of market share at least year-over-year on the whiskey and bourbon side. And you have pretty substantial share growth from Bulleit and then that all other category, which probably some of your brands are there as well. But it seems like that's accelerating a little bit and I know the margin mix obviously is improving quite a bit with Woodford and some of the other variants. So how do you guys kind of manage that? And how important is that market share data? And then again, I know it's a short period of time so maybe it's just not a broad enough data set.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nIt's important to study, I think, over time to make -- I think mostly to make sure that the opportunities you see for your company you're not letting others have. Although I will say it's been my experience in this business to be more growth-oriented and not size- or share-oriented. We be typically don't set scale-based or size-based ambitions relative to competitors for our company. And I -- because I think that can lead to oftentimes the wrong sets of behaviors. And I mean it's not that it's not useful, we're as competitive as the next person so we like to look at share data. But I think the criticality of growth and enduring growth is what we've continued to focus on. And so I mean, I really don't feel like we lose sleep like, for example, I mean, it's been -- it will be a fact with the size of the Jack Daniel's Black Label business in the United States, it will have a very difficult time growing at the growth rate that Woodford Reserve is. I mean, it's just -- it's at an earlier stage of development. So what we tend to do when we look at share data is we look at it with and without Jack Daniel's. We look at it in ways that can inform us and illuminate where there might be growth opportunities for us. And I actually -- I mean, but we are competitive. I will tell you that we want, like for example, at the price point above Jack Daniel's in the U.S. American whiskey market, we want to be a leader. We want to have our fair share of it. That doesn't mean we would do anything at any cost to be the #1 volumetric player at the ultra-premium level. But I will tell you that we really feel like that's an area that we know well. We have the assets, the production assets, and the know-how to be part of that. So and the same thing is true of flavored whiskey. It'd be rare for you to hear us say something like we need to be #1 in flavored whiskey in the United States. That's -- just not compelled by that, and I don't think our company is. We don't like to see other people get consumption that we don't have. But when you have, as our company does today in our largest markets, something like a 6% or 5% market share, and when you have on across the globe less than 1% of the market share, you're going to be really frustrated for a long time if you measure yourself on that basis. So we think we can be an enormously successful company building value for shareholders without having to dominate any particular category or segment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nJane, so on your full year underlying sales guidance, I know you're continuing to stick to the 6% to 7%. You did 6% year-to-date, I guess, last year, you also did 6%. And if I kind of look at the fourth quarter comps being pretty tough and U.S. comps are probably going to be tougher in the next quarter or so. So I'm just wondering, I know it's 100 basis points to get to the high end of it, but are there anything in the back half that you expect some acceleration, whether it's markets or brands that gives you some confidence that actually we could see some acceleration in the back half?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes. So great questions, and again we're looking at our full-year forecasts and we do see, as Paul already alluded to, getting off to a good start in November. So we are seeing an acceleration from that perspective, and so we're expecting -- we had a pretty soft third quarter last year. And so we are expecting soft comps against that or easier comps against that quarter and expect that to be a good quarter for us. You did point out that we did have a nice quarter in the fourth quarter last year with the rollout -- the national rollout of Tennessee Fire in the U.S. But we also have some markets in overseas that we've been testing, not that we're rolling them out further, but we've got further tests to do in some of those markets, so there will be some offset there too, so it won't be a one-for-one kind of thing if you're thinking about it's going out and we've got to cover it all. So but our full-year forecast anticipates all this, Judy. And we think the 6% to 7% range is acceptable and reachable, given the environment we're in currently.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nJust following up on the November trend. So I know you guys had a pretty weak trend in Poland in the third quarter last year. So is the acceleration driven by Poland or are you seeing broad-based acceleration in November?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nIt's pretty broad based right now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\n,\r\nIt -- yes, it's early now but it looks broad-based. Poland's a top 10 market for us but it's rare that it would drive the entirety of Brown-Forman. So oftentimes, the numbers -- I mean, you can get that from sometimes the United States because of the size of it within Brown-Forman. And periodically, you'll get the U.K.'s or the France's and Germany's particularly when they combine. But right now, and again, it's early. We still got a lot to see but we're encouraged by what we've seen broad-based out of November.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nI would just like to add one more thing to that and I alluded to it during my talk -- my script, Travel Retail. And it's still tough sledding there, if you will, but we do know that the U.S. Travel Retail business had some timing issues, and we kept waiting for them to come in, and we started to see them come through in November. And so we would -- are expecting the rate of decline in Travel Retail not to be what it is for the full year. Thus, we are expecting acceleration there from what we've had year-to-date, so that'll add to some of the growth. That's why we've been pointing out and pulling out Travel Retail, both in the first quarter and the second quarter to show what it actually has done to our growth rate and it's been fairly significant in both the year-to-date as well as our first and second quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nThe other thing I'll mention is I think the Travel Retail piece, I mean, we still have some determinations to make inside the company as it relates to geographic expansion on Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, so we'll be getting to those here in the next probably few weeks or so. But the other thing is as the calendar year turns, once we enter into 2016, it marks actually the year where the Jack Daniel's distillery will begin to celebrate its 150th anniversary. So you can imagine that a company like Brown-Forman, it's a great milestone. And I don't know how much impact that would have on this fiscal year, but it's something that we expect to be something that's really nice mobilizing event for the calendar year 2016 period. And you can -- I mean, you can imagine us having a lot of fun with that but also consumers getting to have a lot of fun with it as well. So we'll be talking probably a little more specifically about that with passage of time, maybe a little bit more at the end of Q3. But that's another point I'd note.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nGot it, okay. And then Paul, I know obviously, you said you don't want to comment on any of the market speculation about M&A. But if I just kind of look at your portfolio, and it sounds like you're definitely stepping up your focus on the premium tequila with the Herradura brand, and that makes perfect sense. But as you think about your broader portfolio and thinking about some of the declining brands and sort of the lower margin businesses, what are kind of the puts and takes of -- from a strategic standpoint, of keeping those brands so that you have scale versus perhaps maybe pruning some of the portfolio so you can focus your portfolio to really be more of a whiskey premium tequila brand portfolio even if there is some potential dilution in earnings?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, our -- I think our portfolio management generally across time, I mean, I think you could just observe it. I think it's stood the test of time. I mean, we've increasingly become more premium and more whiskey would be the observations if you go all the way back to the consumer durables days and wine. But I think it would be evident that when we even chose to exit wines, we chose to stay in Sonoma-Cutrer. So we find that our -- I mean, it's just that we have found the benefit of focusing on fewer trademarks that are excellent businesses that have great growth profiles. And the story of Brown-Forman today is that -- a lot of companies will have brands that are smaller in terms of their contribution in the modern day than they might have been 5 or 10 years ago, and we always talk about it -- if the company's Old Forester that here it's enjoying remarkable success both on and off-premise. But it's a little brand still in the scale of Brown-Forman and probably endured about a 50-year decline. And so I guess you could call that patience. We waited for it to get small enough that it could be termed craft and retro and all these other things that it's enjoying this renaissance that it is today. So there's an example of staying with brands. And I really do feel when you take Brown-Forman's portfolio overall and compare it to many of our competitors out there, I mean, we just have one of, if not the most focused portfolios in the spirits industry and I do think we benefit from that. So but as, again, going back I think it was in your preface, we just don't comment on things that either are incoming or potentially outgoing. It's just not -- just doesn't serve us well, and so we let the rumors be the rumors and we keep focused on our business. I know some of you all -- I mean, people have speculated, I will say I'm really encouraged by, there's some recent marketing on the Southern Comfort brand that is literally, I mean, occurring in the last week or so where some viral advertising, I'll call it, associated with Danny McBride has gone out there, and Spotify is noting it as one of the top 10 sort of viral efforts in the United States. It's actually gone global as well. So there's -- I think that's evidence that the brand continues to get support and we continue to try to put our best foot forward in a really competitive environment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Serotta (Analysts)】\nNot to belabor the competition point too much, but wanted to approach it from a different angle. Paul, last quarter, you made the distinction between increased competition for shelf space at retail and back bar space on premise as opposed to competition, price competition, either at retail or on-premise, saying you had clearly seen a pickup in the former, but the latter was kind of in line with historical trends. Wondering whether you could update us on that particularly, price competition in the off-premise? We've seen some hot price points from particular markets. And then related to that, in response to Dara's question, you mentioned some popularly priced flavored whiskeys. I'm just wondering whether you're seeing more or less or the same discounting of sort of the premium core brands from your competitors. So 2 related questions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. I think -- I mean, I think it's fair for us to comment on it. Certainly, there's 2 forms that we're seeing, just to go back and be clear. There are 2 forms of the competitive effort. One is level of entries into the marketplace. There was something in the internal report we were looking at here just this week where, and this is a pretty interesting statistic, in the United States, in the U.S. alone, whiskey market above the $20 price point, so $20 price point above, over the last 4 years, more than 500 new entrants. So there's that -- that would be, now where are you going to put all those? I mean, there's shelf space, back bar. And of course, I mean, that those are, in many instances, highly regional. So you're not -- those aren't going to be full-blown national brands immediately unless they're large trademark line extensions, which have the capacity to do that. But in addition to that, I mean, I don't know, I almost feel like every year for the last 10, around October, November, December, we start to observe increased price competition. And I mean, it differs from brand to brand or company to company, it feels like every year, but I don't know that this year is any more competitive than 2014 was or 2013. I always feel like both anecdotally and when you study the data after the fact, some brands chose to go deep on their 175 or to put RRCs [ph] or coupons out there. I mean, just it all depends on the motivation of those particular competitors. So we have seen some spread difference in the U.S. market between say, Jack Daniel's and Jim Beam. We've seen -- and that would be an example for this year. But in prior years, we've seen other brands go deep on discounting. And all of it is just a reminder of the balancing act. I actually think one of the things that will be interesting to see over the -- this is not a comment about 2015, but as I look out at 2016, '17 and '18, some of this will be dependent upon the stocks available. If these rates of growth for the category continue and these entrants continue to go in and -- we never a have quite good enough feel for how much supply is actually out there. And so if demand outstrips supply out there, I think you'll start to see pricing go up, not down, with sort of rational competitors. So we don't have any indication of that now, but I mean, this growth rates have been running pretty solid for a while now in the industry. And I think that can be an influence to the pricing and the pricing competitiveness out there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Serotta (Analysts)】\nGreat. And just as a follow-up, Jane. Wondering whether you can give us any more color or an update in terms of the COGS inflation. I think last quarter, you were talking about 2% to 3% per -- for the year. I believe last quarter, you talked about some moderation in wood that would happen in the second quarter. It now looks like that's more pushed to the second half. Just wondering whether I'm remembering that correctly or if you could give us an update there as to what happened.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes, sure. So I still think we still would expect COGS somewhere in the 3% range for the year. But in terms of what I've said -- I don't know if I referred to the second quarter or not but let's just focus on the wood as we go forward. We are expecting a moderation in the rate of increase to occur over the back half of the year. That's one of the big drivers of the increase of the COGS growing a little bit faster than it has historically for us. And the reason why it's going to moderate is because last year at this time, the cost of logs, the cost of saves, the cost of headings, if you will, all components that go into making a barrel took a pretty significant increase. And it's continued to increase, but the rate of increase over the balance of year is expected to moderate.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. So going a little bit back to that earlier question, any price/mix benefit that we would have been seeing through the year is being offset somewhat by some of those higher wood costs. As we start to cycle them, we'll get more benefit from our price/mix in that second half because we're cycling a higher base. So that is a positive for the company in that second half.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nik Modi (Analysts)】\nPaul, I was wondering if you can help confirm something we recently picked up in the trade regarding Bacardi putting its distribution out to RFP, breaking the alliance with Remy and Brown-Forman, and if that is true, what would be the implications if the distribution alliance actually broke up? Would that benefit you or would that hurt you? Any thoughts on that would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nWell, it'd be premature to even assess that. I mean, we are aware that there are some RFPs out there if Bacardi has initiated, but as far as we know, we're continuing to partner with them in the same ways that we have historically in the United States. And just remember, there's part of that partnership we do altogether and the respective companies go and do their individual brand building work and then within each company, people building their own individual brands. So I mean, I think no matter what happens, and I always feel this way about the U.S. environment, whether it's wholesale consolidation, supplier consolidation, people changing distributor alignments, et cetera. I really have a high level of confidence in Brown-Forman's ability to navigate the U.S. system. I really do. We do that. We really don't have a one single way of doing it in the United States. There's some literally 50 different ways you can go-to-market in the United States. And so I just like the flexibility, along with the stability that comes from Brown-Forman's historical approach to the U.S. distribution system. And so we really do -- have always -- there's still a lot of markets where we go to the marketplace with Bacardi, not only in the United States but outside of the United States us well. So where that's appropriate, we'll continue to do it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy Ramey (Analysts)】\nJust to recapitulate something you said a few minutes ago, but I think it bears kind thinking a little bit more about. Consumer behavior in alcoholic beverages has always shown a tendency to more complex flavors and more crafted favors, if you will, light beer drinkers go to beer drinkers, become craft beer drinkers and so on. And so I mean, I think it really is the right way to think about it to think that the best thing about Tennessee Fire is Jack Daniel's Black Label. The best thing about Jack Daniel's Black Label is Woodford Reserve or Gentleman Jack. Am I thinking about that right over a kind of 10-year outlook?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nI mean, yes, I think that's one aspect of it, Tim. I think there's a phenomenon that's really interesting in the, call it spirits category relative to -- we often get compared to beer or wine. So one observation along the lines of what you're thinking is just first to ground you. Remember that the core offering of distilled spirits more often than not, it's consumed in its final format in a varied or flavored or mixed way. So it's even more natural in my view for flavored spirits to exist In some forms, it's providing convenience. In other forms, it's providing a little more prepared form of what they ultimately enjoy anyway. So and that's not true. I mean, beer is not an ingredient in a broader base beverage, for example. So I think that's one thing to think about, which I think bodes well for the longer run. The 2 factors that I think will make flavored whiskey have a longer life versus shorter are that it's inherently the way the core whiskey category gets consumed anyway. And two is that they are aged products that have a moderating and regulating mechanism to the boom bust phenomenon that can happen. I think those are 2 contributing factors that, they don't guarantee that some brands won't go away or there won't be some bubble or something like that. But for our business, it's why we believe that they can be very strong enduring brands. Then the other piece is what you're talking about, which is the -- and I'm just going to give you an anecdotal one because I saw it over the last -- saw these last night. I mean, I'll give you an example, my wife, who literally does not drink whiskey and never has. And with the introduction of Tennessee Honey and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, I mean, literally, I mean, she said, \"Well, that really tastes good, for example, on the rocks.\" And literally over the Thanksgiving holiday, she was stealing my Gentleman Jack on the rocks. I mean, so here is an example of somebody who's developed a palate over a period of time, so that -- somebody who never would have been interested in the category. And I think is an example of what you're referring to. Now whether or not she'll trade up to Woodford Reserve or Double Oaked, I don't know. But in any event, I think there's real foundation to the premise that you suggested there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy Ramey (Analysts)】\nYes. At the end of the day, the ultra-premium is kind of where everybody is going. They might get stuck along the way, but they might end up going there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nTim, the other thing, it's a really affordable luxury. I mean, you can get, on a liter of, say, Woodford Reserve, you're getting -- there's 20 standard drinks in a liter of Woodford Reserve. And for the money compared to where you might put your entertainment dollar, particularly if you're entertaining people at home, it's a real value.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy Ramey (Analysts)】\nJust a quick question on barrel making. I mean, you do all that in-house, I believe. And so other than just the raw material costs, as you expand barrel-making activity, should we think about that sort of diluting COGS from higher depreciation and so on? Or should we think about that as a benefit to COGS from greater efficiencies? How would we think about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, we're definitely building our new -- all of our new facilities with a couple things in mind. One, to make them as efficient and effective as possible; and two, make them scalable, so we're not necessarily building it to be double what we need today, we're building it and scaling it as we go. So I think the answer is sort of in the middle, there will definitely be some incremental depreciation as time goes on from some of the investments we're making, but we're also being very thoughtful in terms of how much we're investing now to minimize overproducing -- over constructing and over making something that we don't need at this point.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, a couple things I think in addition to what Jane's saying there is, just remember from a traditional economies of scale thing. I mean, barrel making, you don't run this down the line in the way that you get that ramped up with [indiscernible]. I mean, these are made by people, human beings. I mean, so that's one of the tricks of the barrel making operation. The -- I mean, we do get some benefit I think on a little bit, probably on freight because we're down closer. The new cooperage is a little closer to Jack, which is the primary customer. I mean, a lot of it would depend too on how you account for which, the used barrel sales a little bit. And do you count that as efficiency or do you count that as a sale. And of course, we've been benefiting from the used barrel sales these last couple of years because the market's been so buoyant. So a lot of it depends on how you account for that aspect of it. I will say the other piece that relates to that is it really was in part a, I'll call it a risk mitigation move by the company to ensure we had 2 cooperages spaced in different locations, et cetera. So Tim, as we we've learned that long ago with warehouses and other aspects of the businesses, but it was really was -- bought some insurance for us as well because our business is so attractive, we would not want to be -- have any limitations as it relates to getting wood.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy Ramey (Analysts)】\nYes, I would just say anecdotally in wine, used barrel prices are up 100% because there's so much demand from craft distillers and craft beer makers who want to put the beer in oak, so.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYou bet.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nThat's one of the reasons why the cost just of our own wood that we were procuring went up because some of the wood was going to the beer and -- the craft beer.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nA lot of competition for people.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nA lot of competition, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nThey want to use coopers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Chappell (Analysts)】\nJust a couple things just on the cost front I just wanted to clarify. You had said wood prices would get better in the back half. I mean, is that a sort of a longer-term trend as we move into kind of '17? Or is that just very small changes on year-over-year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nBill, that's actually what I was referring to is a year-over-year comparison. So the rate of change that we have experienced in the first half of the year versus -- is abating over the rest of the year. It's not that the costs themselves are coming down at this point because of supply-demand, the demand for it is still outstripping the supply.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nThey're just comping the higher pace. They're just -- in the second half. They started to go up in the second half of last year, so they won't -- you won't have that negative impact as you did in the first half.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Chappell (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then I kind of missed the commentary. You had said also SG&A would kind of accelerate faster in the back half. Is there something behind that in terms of like marketing advertising? Or is that just kind of the normal flow?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nI was referring to operating expenses. So if you look at our first -- operating expenses in the first half of the year, they were up modestly and lot of it's due to easy comps, if you will, versus last year. We had pretty high spending in the first half of last year. So we're flipping it in the second half so you have tougher comps, if you will. So that's all.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Chappell (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then last one just in all the competition, all the talk about price competition. Does this impact your kind of use of the goal of trying to raise price a couple percentage points every year as we look to kind of the June price increase?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nWell, I don't know that we've ever had that programmatic an approach to it. I mean, I think we do like to try to advance prices, but we kind of do it -- I can recall now, we did some June and July pricing 3 years ago, yes, I think, yes, where we thought that was the right timing to do it. And not all markets did it then but a large number of them did. Sometimes, they're associated with input costs, other times they're associated more with price positioning, just the desire to continue to price the brands at the premium level around the world. So I mean, we'll probably be taking, here in the next, I don't know, 90 days, start to look at where our expectations would be for FY '17 as it relates to pricing, but we haven't -- don't have any early thoughts on that. We will continue to get -- I mean, as you sell -- I'll just use the example, as you sell more Woodford Reserve and sort of less Canadian Mist, you'll continue to get mix though. That'll continue to roll.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Chappell (Analysts)】\nSure. But in terms of what you're saying, the current price competition in the U.S. doesn't alter your plans at this point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nI mean, you've got to look at it. I mean, the reality is, is that a lot of the competition I'm talking about is above the Jack Daniel's price point. So as it relates to Jack Daniel's, I mean, we're as motivated to make sure we're not seen as too lower-priced related to a lot of these new entrants because pricing in addition to being an economic tool is also a marketing tool in this business. So I just feel like we'll be weighing that as well as we do what the price spread is between us and say Jim Beam. I mean, we'll be looking at both factors.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Koval (Executives)】\nThank you, Paul and Jane, and thanks to all of you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. And please feel free to reach out to us if you have any additional question. Thanks, and have a great week.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nThank you all.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nThanks.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, CIBC's senior executives will review CIBC's Q4 2015 results that were released earlier today. The documents referenced on this call, including CIBC's Q4 news release, investor presentation and financial supplement as well as CIBC's annual report can all be found on our website at cibc.com. In addition, an archive of this audio webcast will be available on our website later today. \r\nThis morning's agenda will include opening remarks from Victor Dodig, CIBC's President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Glass, our Chief Financial Officer, will follow with a financial review; and Laura Dottori-Attanasio, our Chief Risk Officer, will close the formal remarks with a risk management update. After the presentations, there will be a question-and-answer period that will conclude by 9:00 a.m. Also with us for the question-and-answer period are CIBC's business leaders, including Harry Culham, Steve Geist and David Williamson as well as other senior officers. \r\nBefore we begin, let me remind you that any individual speaking on behalf of CIBC on today's call may make forward-looking statements that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. These statements may include material factors or assumptions that could cause CIBC's actual results in future periods to differ materially. For further information, please refer to the note about forward-looking statements in today's press release. \r\nWith that, let me now turn the meeting over to Victor.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Geoff, and greetings, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call. This morning, CIBC reported annual adjusted earnings of $3.8 billion with earnings per share up 6% from last year. We also delivered an industry-leading return on equity 20%, while increasing our capital strength with a Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.8%. \r\nWe entered fiscal 2015 as a team with 3 goals in mind. One was to rejuvenate our corporate culture; the second was to reengage our clients; and the third was to enhance shareholder value. And I believe we have made excellent progress in all 3 areas. \r\nThroughout the year, we invested considerable time and effort as a team to change the way we think and to change the way we operate. We also made a concerted effort to reengage with our clients to better understand their needs. Personally, I met with over 500 of our corporate and business banking clients to convey our commitment to putting the commerce back into CIBC. \r\nOur vision is to become the leader in client relationships. And aligned to that vision, we repositioned our brand from what -- from the tagline \"For what matters\" to \"Banking that fits your life.\" Our clients, they want a bank that knows them, values their business, advocates for them, fixes their problems quickly and listens to their needs. Our team members are feeling energized by a renewed client-focused strategy. In 2015, we received our highest employee Net Promoter Scores on record. In terms of shareholder value, we increased our dividends by 12%, which helped drive our industry-leading total shareholder returns in 2015.\r\nNow although we've made progress, the work is far from done. We're going to continue to evolve our culture and we're going to place a greater emphasis on performance orientation. We're going to continue to focus relentlessly on our clients and deliver to them what's relevant to them, and we're going to unlock shareholder value by transforming our foundational business, by optimizing the use of our balance sheet and by redeploying capital to businesses that are core to our strategy and core to the future.\r\nSo our goal is clear. It's to build an innovative, relationship-oriented bank that provides consistent and sustainable earnings growth through a 3-pillared strategy. We outlined that 3-pillar strategy at our investor presentation. I'd like to go through it again this morning. \r\nThe first pillar is to simplify our bank. We will transform CIBC into a nimble financial institution. We will leverage technology and we're going to redeploy the resources to improve our efficiency. We're going to be better at cost management and better at growth. We believe we can get to -- our efficiency ratio down to 55% from the current 59% over the medium term.\r\nThe second pillar of our strategy is to continue to focus on innovation. We are the innovation leader today in banking, but the rapid pace of change in the industry, especially from FinTech disruptors, is forcing all of us and CIBC to continue to innovate for our clients as they adopt new technologies and look for secure, easier and more flexible ways to do their day-to-day banking. We recognize at CIBC that we can't build everything ourselves, and that's why we're open to collaborating with high-quality third parties where appropriate. \r\nOur third pillar is a relentless focus on our clients. Our goal is to be #1 in client experience over the medium term. Since we've shifted our focus from being a product-centric bank to being a client-centric bank 4 years ago, we've had third-party validation that our strategy is working. For the past 3 years, CIBC was the only Big Five Canadian bank with positive momentum in client experience as reported by both the Ipsos Reid and the JD Power client satisfaction surveys. So we're making an impact in the marketplace, but there is still a lot of work to do to be #1. So we've declared client experience as a bank-wide priority, and we've made changes to the executive compensation programs such that client experience goals are a meaningful part of our compensation program.\r\nSo if I can now just turn briefly to the macroeconomic front. We expect the Canadian banking industry will continue to face headwinds from a low interest rate environment and sustained low commodity prices in 2016. While we are cautious about the economic environment, we are confident that our risk management protocols will detect the early warning signals that allow us to react appropriately and still work with our clients. \r\nNow I'd like to give you some highlights from each of our business units. In Retail and Business Banking, we transformed our branches into banking centers. That's an important point, we don't call them branches anymore. And the focus is on providing personalized advice and deepening our client relationships. \r\nFor day-to-day banking transactions, we are leveraging our digital technology and encouraging our clients to access banking through their tablets and through their mobile devices and obviously, the ATMs that exist at our banking centers. \r\nAt our banking centers, we also simplified the leadership structure and introduced the new role of a banking center leader. This will give each of our over 1,000 banking centers across Canada a single leader responsible for building and deepening client relationships and strengthening ties in their communities.\r\nFor our mass affluent clients, we expanded our Imperial Service Direct offer. This is an offer that connects clients with a dedicated financial advisory team remotely. This offer enables us to deliver financial advice and deepen relationships with those clients who visit our banking centers infrequently, yet they prefer a dedicated team to meet their needs. \r\nIn business banking, we added more relationship managers to meet our clients' needs and offer them advice to help them with their -- the growth of their businesses. To build our business banking client base, we recently entered into an exclusive partnership with a Montréal-based lender, Thinking Capital, and we announced that recently, who provides short-term online loans to small businesses with unanticipated needs. The size of the loans range from $5,000 to $300,000 and the unique selling point here is the adjudication can be done in less than 10 minutes using technology. Funds from approved loans are deposited in a matter of days instead of weeks as is the case for traditional small business banking. \r\nThis partnership, like many of our partnerships, are about leveraging innovation to broaden our -- broaden the options for existing business clients and attract new business and personal banking relationships to CIBC.\r\nTo further CIBC's innovation leadership for our clients, we also entered into a partnership with the MaRS Discovery District in Toronto to create a new corporate innovation hub. We're also part of MaRS' new FinTech cluster to continue our focus on developing the next wave of banking innovations for our clients. My colleague, David Williamson, is here this morning to answer your questions about Retail and Business Banking.\r\nOur Wealth Management franchise also has made good progress in 2015 against our strategy of enhancing the client experience and attracting new clients. Our Canadian asset management business achieved its sixth consecutive record with $5.5 billion in net sales of long-term mutual funds. \r\nNew account openings at CIBC's Investor's Edge were up 36% year-over-year and that was driven by a strong partnership in our retail banking centers; it was also driven by innovation where we've significantly shortened the account opening time for a self-directed brokerage account. \r\nWithin CIBC Wood Gundy, we continue to invest in our technology platform to significantly streamline the new client and account opening process, again using technology. And we've used technology to provide personalized service. We launched a new planning capability, which will help us to deliver comprehensive and individually-tailored financial plans to each of our clients.\r\nWe also experienced strong net flows in our Atlantic Trust business in the U.S., which continues to perform well. My colleague, Steve Geist, our Head of Wealth Management, is here to answer your questions on Wealth Management this morning.\r\nNow in early October at our Investor Day, we announced the name change of our Wholesale Banking business to CIBC Capital Markets. We're moving away from Wholesale Banking. We're moving away from world markets. We're moving into the future and calling ourselves CIBC Capital Markets. We believe that this name better reflects what we do in this business unit, which is to provide advice, insight and execution in the Capital Markets for those clients that are particularly reliant on that source of financing.\r\nThroughout 2015, our Capital Markets franchise continued to hold leadership positions in syndicated loans, debt and equity underwriting, M&A advisory and trading activities. We also made good progress against our strategy of helping our clients grow globally by expanding our lending and advisory mandates, particularly in areas of our core competency in energy, utilities and infrastructure finance. \r\nTo support our clients' businesses, we continue to expand our suite of Capital Markets products in key regions globally in the areas of foreign exchange, fixed income, commodities and equity derivatives.\r\nOn the innovation front, Capital Markets recently introduced 2 new products for the convenience of all our clients at CIBC, products that our clients are already embracing in a very important way. The first is CIBC Global Money Transfer, a no-fee service allowing our clients to send money overseas easily and affordably online from their online banking account or from our banking centers. \r\nThe second offering is CIBC Foreign Cash Online, which allows our clients to order any of 75 foreign currencies online for secured delivery to their home or their local banking center, and in Toronto at Pearson Airport at no extra charge. \r\nThese 2 innovative products underscore our commitment to simplifying banking for our clients and being the leading provider of foreign exchange in Canada. It's also a classic example where our Capital Markets expertise works with our retail expertise to deliver to main street Canada what they need each and every day. My colleague, Harry Culham, our Head of Capital Markets, is here this morning to answer your questions.\r\nSo I'm going to close now and as I reflect on my first year as the leader of CIBC, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made as a team. And I'm very excited about what lies ahead for our shareholders and for our employees and for our clients. \r\nOur strategy will allow us to unlock value, will allow us to redeploy resources for growth and we're going to remain vigilant when it comes to managing risk and managing our cost structure. And on behalf of CIBC's executive committee and our board, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders for their continued support and all of our team, our 44,000 employees, for their ongoing dedication of serving our 11 million clients. I'd be remiss if I didn't wish everybody a happy holiday, if I don't get the opportunity to do that again on this call. We have a lot to be thankful for. \r\nAnd with that thankfulness, let met turn it over to Kevin to review our results in detail. Kevin?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Victor. So my presentation will refer to the slides that are posted on our website, starting with Slide 5. And before I review the fourth quarter in detail, let me start with a brief overview, just a reminder of the full year where our adjusted net income was a record $3.8 billion and adjusted EPS was $9.45, up 6% from 2014. I think our performance in 2015 reflects the strength of our client-focused strategy and diversified business segments. \r\nAdjusted revenue growth of 6% was driven by strong asset growth, improved margins and higher fee income. And we delivered an industry-leading ROE of 20% and a year-over-year increase in dividends paid of 9% per share and the highest total shareholder return among our peers. We finished the year with a Basel III CET1 ratio of 10.8%.\r\nSo moving on to our results for the fourth quarter. CIBC delivered adjusted net income of $952 million and adjusted EPS of $2.36. Record earnings in Retail and Business Banking reflects strong loan and deposit growth. We had stable results in challenging market environment in both our Wealth Management and Capital Market segments, and we increased our quarterly dividend by $0.03 to $1.15 per share.\r\nWe have 3 items of note during the quarter, which resulted in a negative impact of $0.43 per share, and the most significant item of note was the restructuring charge of $161 million after-tax in noncontrolling interest, reflecting the initiatives we have been implementing to simplify our bank and better align our resources to meet the changing needs of our clients.\r\nThe balance of my presentation will be focused on adjusted results, which exclude these items of note. We have included slides with reported results in the appendix to this presentation.\r\nLet me now review the performance of our business segments starting with the results of Retail and Business Banking on Slide 7. Revenue for the quarter was $2.2 billion, up 6% from last year, driven by strong performance in both personal and business banking. Revenue in personal banking was $1.7 billion, up 7% compared with the same period last year. \r\nPerformance benefited from volume growth across most products, with total personal funds managed up 9%. Wider spreads in our variable-rate lending products and higher fee income, primarily driven by strong sales of long-term mutual funds, also drove higher revenue.\r\nRevenue in business banking was $414 million for the quarter, up 5% compared with the same period last year. And business banking benefited from strong loan and deposit growth and higher fee income. \r\nBusiness loans are up 10% year-over-year and business deposits up 9%. Revenue growth was muted due to the persistent low-interest rate environment, which continues to narrow margins on business deposits. \r\nThe other segment had revenue of $20 million, which is down $7 million from the same period last year due to the continued run-off of the exited FirstLine mortgage broker business.\r\nOur provision for credit losses in the segment was $190 million, up 11% from last year due to higher business banking losses, largely 2 company-specific losses in the oil and gas sector. Noninterest expenses were $1.1 billion, up 4% from the prior year, primarily driven by our continued investment in strategic growth initiatives, directs [ph] towards innovation and transforming our business to better serve our clients. \r\nOur net interest margin was up 1 basis point sequentially, mainly due to wider spreads on variable-rate lending products.\r\nIn the quarter, Retail and Business Banking reported record adjusted net income of $656 million, up 7% from the same period last year.\r\nSlide 8 reflects the results of our Wealth Management segment. Revenue for the quarter was $612 million, up $25 million or 4% from the prior year with solid performance from most business lines. Retail brokerage revenue of $304 million was relatively flat year-over-year as growth in fee-based revenue was offset by lower commission revenue, mainly due to a decline in transaction volumes. \r\nAsset management revenue of $217 million was up $11 million or 5% from last year. This was largely due to higher assets under management driven by strong net sales of long-term mutual funds. And on a full year basis, CIBC achieved a record $5.5 billion in net sales.\r\nPrivate Wealth Management revenue of $91 million was up $12 million or 15%, mainly due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and higher assets under management driven by net flows. \r\nNoninterest expenses of $443 million were up $19 million or 4%, primarily due to higher employee-related costs, including performance-based compensation and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Net income in Wealth Management was up $5 million or 4% from the fourth quarter of last year.\r\nTurning to Capital Markets on Slide 9. Our results reflect the challenging market conditions that are highlighted. But despite these headwinds, we delivered results in line with last year. Revenue for the quarter was $578 million, again, in line with the prior year quarter.\r\nGlobal markets revenue of $310 million was up $2 million from the prior year as higher revenue from debt issuance activities was largely offset by lower equity underwriting and trading revenue. \r\nCorporate and investment banking revenue of $269 million was up $4 million from the prior year, with higher revenue from corporate lending and advisory, was partially offset by lower underwriting activity. There was a net credit recovery of $5 million this quarter compared to the provision of $14 million in the prior year. \r\nNoninterest expenses of $321 million were up $29 million from the prior year, primarily due to higher employee-related costs. Net income of $211 million was in line with the prior year. \r\nSlide 10 reflects the results of the corporate and other segment. The net loss for the quarter was $44 million compared with the net loss of $45 million in the prior year. Higher earnings in CIBC FirstCaribbean due to favorable foreign exchange and good credit performance was largely offset by lower investment gains. The current quarter also benefited from certain year-end tax credits. Losses in this segment have historically been in the $60 million to $70 million range and we would anticipate it being at that level going forward. \r\nCIBC's capital position remains strong. Our Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.8%, the same level as in the prior quarter. \r\nSolid organic capital generation was offset by the impact of higher risk-weighted assets, and our RWAs increased by $2 billion from the prior quarter as a result of strong growth in our lending portfolios.\r\nOur Basel III leverage ratio was 3.9%, which is well above the minimum required by our regulator. \r\nSo to wrap up, we're very pleased with our results this quarter which capped a record year in which we had strong performances from all of our businesses. \r\nIn 2015, we performed well against our medium-term financial objectives, with strong earnings growth and continued capital strength. Heading into 2016, we feel confident about delivering long-term value to our shareholders. \r\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the meeting over to Laura Dottori.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. I'll be referring to the risk section, which begins on Slide 13, where you'll see that loan losses came in at $198 million or 26 basis points, which is up $9 million or 1 basis point from the prior quarter. This was mainly due to higher losses in business banking related to 2 oil and gas accounts and that was partially offset by recoveries in our Capital Markets. \r\nTurning to Slide 14. New formations were up $64 million quarter-over-quarter due to the 2 accounts I mentioned earlier. You'll see that gross impaired loans were down, and that's primarily as a result of declines in CIBC FirstCaribbean and in the U.S. region. \r\nGross impaired loans as a percentage of gross loans and acceptances have trended down over the past few years and they've come in at 49 basis points this quarter. \r\nTo review our oil and gas portfolio, you'll see Slide 15 shows our corporate and business banking portfolios. We have $17.3 billion of direct exposure, which is down slightly from $17.4 billion last quarter. Our loans outstanding have declined $131 million or 2% quarter-over-quarter. 78% of our exposure is investment-grade and this has remained stable throughout the year. 56% of that is to exploration and production companies, with only 5% in the services space.\r\nOn Slide 16, you see our retail portfolio exposure to oil and gas, where we have $39 billion exposure to the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland, and that's up from $38 billion last quarter. If we exclude insured mortgages, we have $17 billion, which is unchanged from last year. \r\nOverall, our portfolio is performing as expected given the stressed oil prices. We continue to be vigilant and to proactively monitor our exposures.\r\nTurning to cards on Slide 17. You'll see that our net credit losses were $88 million this quarter, that's down $5 million from last quarter. And this is attributable to the seasonality as we typically see lower write-offs in our cards portfolio in the fourth quarter. \r\nIn the oil provinces, we've seen some increases in delinquencies, but this performance has been, as I mentioned earlier, as expected. The increase was mainly in the segment of customers with lower credit quality, which accounts for just over 1% of our total retail portfolio. \r\nThe overall cards portfolio continues to perform well. The delinquency increase in this quarter was driven by seasonal increase from the low levels in the summer. We continue to monitor our exposure in the oil provinces across all retail lending and remain cautious given that we are seeing increases in unemployment claims.\r\nOur Canadian residential mortgage portfolio is highlighted on Slide 18. As you can see, 64% of our portfolio is insured with 82% of the insurance being provided by the CMHC. The weighted average loan-to-value of our uninsured portfolio is 59% and has remained stable over the past year. \r\nCondo mortgages account for roughly 11% of our portfolio and the loan-to-value of the uninsured portion is 61%.\r\nSlide 19 shows our condo developer exposure, which continues to remain diversified across many projects, and both drawn and authorized loans have remained stable over the year. \r\nLastly, on Slide 20, this shows the distribution of revenue in our trading portfolios as compared with VaR. We had one negative trading day this quarter compared with none last quarter. Our average trading VaR was $3.9 million, roughly in line with last quarter at $3.7 million. \r\nI'll now turn things back to Geoff.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Laura. Well, that concludes our prepared remarks and we'll now move on to the Q&A. Operator, can we please have the first question on the phone?",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Geoffrey Weiss (Executives)】\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, CIBC's senior executives will review CIBC's Q4 2015 results that were released earlier today. The documents referenced on this call, including CIBC's Q4 news release, investor presentation and financial supplement as well as CIBC's annual report can all be found on our website at cibc.com. In addition, an archive of this audio webcast will be available on our website later today. \r\nThis morning's agenda will include opening remarks from Victor Dodig, CIBC's President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Glass, our Chief Financial Officer, will follow with a financial review; and Laura Dottori-Attanasio, our Chief Risk Officer, will close the formal remarks with a risk management update. After the presentations, there will be a question-and-answer period that will conclude by 9:00 a.m. Also with us for the question-and-answer period are CIBC's business leaders, including Harry Culham, Steve Geist and David Williamson as well as other senior officers. \r\nBefore we begin, let me remind you that any individual speaking on behalf of CIBC on today's call may make forward-looking statements that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. These statements may include material factors or assumptions that could cause CIBC's actual results in future periods to differ materially. For further information, please refer to the note about forward-looking statements in today's press release. \r\nWith that, let me now turn the meeting over to Victor.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nThanks, Geoff, and greetings, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call. This morning, CIBC reported annual adjusted earnings of $3.8 billion with earnings per share up 6% from last year. We also delivered an industry-leading return on equity 20%, while increasing our capital strength with a Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.8%. \r\nWe entered fiscal 2015 as a team with 3 goals in mind. One was to rejuvenate our corporate culture; the second was to reengage our clients; and the third was to enhance shareholder value. And I believe we have made excellent progress in all 3 areas. \r\nThroughout the year, we invested considerable time and effort as a team to change the way we think and to change the way we operate. We also made a concerted effort to reengage with our clients to better understand their needs. Personally, I met with over 500 of our corporate and business banking clients to convey our commitment to putting the commerce back into CIBC. \r\nOur vision is to become the leader in client relationships. And aligned to that vision, we repositioned our brand from what -- from the tagline \"For what matters\" to \"Banking that fits your life.\" Our clients, they want a bank that knows them, values their business, advocates for them, fixes their problems quickly and listens to their needs. Our team members are feeling energized by a renewed client-focused strategy. In 2015, we received our highest employee Net Promoter Scores on record. In terms of shareholder value, we increased our dividends by 12%, which helped drive our industry-leading total shareholder returns in 2015.\r\nNow although we've made progress, the work is far from done. We're going to continue to evolve our culture and we're going to place a greater emphasis on performance orientation. We're going to continue to focus relentlessly on our clients and deliver to them what's relevant to them, and we're going to unlock shareholder value by transforming our foundational business, by optimizing the use of our balance sheet and by redeploying capital to businesses that are core to our strategy and core to the future.\r\nSo our goal is clear. It's to build an innovative, relationship-oriented bank that provides consistent and sustainable earnings growth through a 3-pillared strategy. We outlined that 3-pillar strategy at our investor presentation. I'd like to go through it again this morning. \r\nThe first pillar is to simplify our bank. We will transform CIBC into a nimble financial institution. We will leverage technology and we're going to redeploy the resources to improve our efficiency. We're going to be better at cost management and better at growth. We believe we can get to -- our efficiency ratio down to 55% from the current 59% over the medium term.\r\nThe second pillar of our strategy is to continue to focus on innovation. We are the innovation leader today in banking, but the rapid pace of change in the industry, especially from FinTech disruptors, is forcing all of us and CIBC to continue to innovate for our clients as they adopt new technologies and look for secure, easier and more flexible ways to do their day-to-day banking. We recognize at CIBC that we can't build everything ourselves, and that's why we're open to collaborating with high-quality third parties where appropriate. \r\nOur third pillar is a relentless focus on our clients. Our goal is to be #1 in client experience over the medium term. Since we've shifted our focus from being a product-centric bank to being a client-centric bank 4 years ago, we've had third-party validation that our strategy is working. For the past 3 years, CIBC was the only Big Five Canadian bank with positive momentum in client experience as reported by both the Ipsos Reid and the JD Power client satisfaction surveys. So we're making an impact in the marketplace, but there is still a lot of work to do to be #1. So we've declared client experience as a bank-wide priority, and we've made changes to the executive compensation programs such that client experience goals are a meaningful part of our compensation program.\r\nSo if I can now just turn briefly to the macroeconomic front. We expect the Canadian banking industry will continue to face headwinds from a low interest rate environment and sustained low commodity prices in 2016. While we are cautious about the economic environment, we are confident that our risk management protocols will detect the early warning signals that allow us to react appropriately and still work with our clients. \r\nNow I'd like to give you some highlights from each of our business units. In Retail and Business Banking, we transformed our branches into banking centers. That's an important point, we don't call them branches anymore. And the focus is on providing personalized advice and deepening our client relationships. \r\nFor day-to-day banking transactions, we are leveraging our digital technology and encouraging our clients to access banking through their tablets and through their mobile devices and obviously, the ATMs that exist at our banking centers. \r\nAt our banking centers, we also simplified the leadership structure and introduced the new role of a banking center leader. This will give each of our over 1,000 banking centers across Canada a single leader responsible for building and deepening client relationships and strengthening ties in their communities.\r\nFor our mass affluent clients, we expanded our Imperial Service Direct offer. This is an offer that connects clients with a dedicated financial advisory team remotely. This offer enables us to deliver financial advice and deepen relationships with those clients who visit our banking centers infrequently, yet they prefer a dedicated team to meet their needs. \r\nIn business banking, we added more relationship managers to meet our clients' needs and offer them advice to help them with their -- the growth of their businesses. To build our business banking client base, we recently entered into an exclusive partnership with a Montréal-based lender, Thinking Capital, and we announced that recently, who provides short-term online loans to small businesses with unanticipated needs. The size of the loans range from $5,000 to $300,000 and the unique selling point here is the adjudication can be done in less than 10 minutes using technology. Funds from approved loans are deposited in a matter of days instead of weeks as is the case for traditional small business banking. \r\nThis partnership, like many of our partnerships, are about leveraging innovation to broaden our -- broaden the options for existing business clients and attract new business and personal banking relationships to CIBC.\r\nTo further CIBC's innovation leadership for our clients, we also entered into a partnership with the MaRS Discovery District in Toronto to create a new corporate innovation hub. We're also part of MaRS' new FinTech cluster to continue our focus on developing the next wave of banking innovations for our clients. My colleague, David Williamson, is here this morning to answer your questions about Retail and Business Banking.\r\nOur Wealth Management franchise also has made good progress in 2015 against our strategy of enhancing the client experience and attracting new clients. Our Canadian asset management business achieved its sixth consecutive record with $5.5 billion in net sales of long-term mutual funds. \r\nNew account openings at CIBC's Investor's Edge were up 36% year-over-year and that was driven by a strong partnership in our retail banking centers; it was also driven by innovation where we've significantly shortened the account opening time for a self-directed brokerage account. \r\nWithin CIBC Wood Gundy, we continue to invest in our technology platform to significantly streamline the new client and account opening process, again using technology. And we've used technology to provide personalized service. We launched a new planning capability, which will help us to deliver comprehensive and individually-tailored financial plans to each of our clients.\r\nWe also experienced strong net flows in our Atlantic Trust business in the U.S., which continues to perform well. My colleague, Steve Geist, our Head of Wealth Management, is here to answer your questions on Wealth Management this morning.\r\nNow in early October at our Investor Day, we announced the name change of our Wholesale Banking business to CIBC Capital Markets. We're moving away from Wholesale Banking. We're moving away from world markets. We're moving into the future and calling ourselves CIBC Capital Markets. We believe that this name better reflects what we do in this business unit, which is to provide advice, insight and execution in the Capital Markets for those clients that are particularly reliant on that source of financing.\r\nThroughout 2015, our Capital Markets franchise continued to hold leadership positions in syndicated loans, debt and equity underwriting, M&A advisory and trading activities.

I'd be remiss if I didn't wish everybody a happy holiday, if I don't get the opportunity to do that again on this call. We have a lot to be thankful for. \r\nAnd with that thankfulness, let met turn it over to Kevin to review our results in detail. Kevin?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Kevin Glass (Executives)】\nThanks, Victor. So my presentation will refer to the slides that are posted on our website, starting with Slide 5. And before I review the fourth quarter in detail, let me start with a brief overview, just a reminder of the full year where our adjusted net income was a record $3.8 billion and adjusted EPS was $9.45, up 6% from 2014. I think our performance in 2015 reflects the strength of our client-focused strategy and diversified business segments. \r\nAdjusted revenue growth of 6% was driven by strong asset growth, improved margins and higher fee income. And we delivered an industry-leading ROE of 20% and a year-over-year increase in dividends paid of 9% per share and the highest total shareholder return among our peers. We finished the year with a Basel III CET1 ratio of 10.8%.\r\nSo moving on to our results for the fourth quarter. CIBC delivered adjusted net income of $952 million and adjusted EPS of $2.36. Record earnings in Retail and Business Banking reflects strong loan and deposit growth. We had stable results in challenging market environment in both our Wealth Management and Capital Market segments, and we increased our quarterly dividend by $0.03 to $1.15 per share.\r\nWe have 3 items of note during the quarter, which resulted in a negative impact of $0.43 per share, and the most significant item of note was the restructuring charge of $161 million after-tax in noncontrolling interest, reflecting the initiatives we have been implementing to simplify our bank and better align our resources to meet the changing needs of our clients.\r\nThe balance of my presentation will be focused on adjusted results, which exclude these items of note. We have included slides with reported results in the appendix to this presentation.\r\nLet me now review the performance of our business segments starting with the results of Retail and Business Banking on Slide 7. Revenue for the quarter was $2.2 billion, up 6% from last year, driven by strong performance in both personal and business banking. Revenue in personal banking was $1.7 billion, up 7% compared with the same period last year. \r\nPerformance benefited from volume growth across most products, with total personal funds managed up 9%. Wider spreads in our variable-rate lending products and higher fee income, primarily driven by strong sales of long-term mutual funds, also drove higher revenue.\r\nRevenue in business banking was $414 million for the quarter, up 5% compared with the same period last year. And business banking benefited from strong loan and deposit growth and higher fee income. \r\nBusiness loans are up 10% year-over-year and business deposits up 9%. Revenue growth was muted due to the persistent low-interest rate environment, which continues to narrow margins on business deposits. \r\nThe other segment had revenue of $20 million, which is down $7 million from the same period last year due to the continued run-off of the exited FirstLine mortgage broker business.\r\nOur provision for credit losses in the segment was $190 million, up 11% from last year due to higher business banking losses, largely 2 company-specific losses in the oil and gas sector. Noninterest expenses were $1.1 billion, up 4% from the prior year, primarily driven by our continued investment in strategic growth initiatives, directs [ph] towards innovation and transforming our business to better serve our clients. \r\nOur net interest margin was up 1 basis point sequentially, mainly due to wider spreads on variable-rate lending products.\r\nIn the quarter, Retail and Business Banking reported record adjusted net income of $656 million, up 7% from the same period last year.\r\nSlide 8 reflects the results of our Wealth Management segment. Revenue for the quarter was $612 million, up $25 million or 4% from the prior year with solid performance from most business lines. Retail brokerage revenue of $304 million was relatively flat year-over-year as growth in fee-based revenue was offset by lower commission revenue, mainly due to a decline in transaction volumes. \r\nAsset management revenue of $217 million was up $11 million or 5% from last year. This was largely due to higher assets under management driven by strong net sales of long-term mutual funds. And on a full year basis, CIBC achieved a record $5.5 billion in net sales.\r\nPrivate Wealth Management revenue of $91 million was up $12 million or 15%, mainly due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and higher assets under management driven by net flows. \r\nNoninterest expenses of $443 million were up $19 million or 4%, primarily due to higher employee-related costs, including performance-based compensation and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Net income in Wealth Management was up $5 million or 4% from the fourth quarter of last year.\r\nTurning to Capital Markets on Slide 9. Our results reflect the challenging market conditions that are highlighted. But despite these headwinds, we delivered results in line with last year. Revenue for the quarter was $578 million, again, in line with the prior year quarter.\r\nGlobal markets revenue of $310 million was up $2 million from the prior year as higher revenue from debt issuance activities was largely offset by lower equity underwriting and trading revenue. \r\nCorporate and investment banking revenue of $269 million was up $4 million from the prior year, with higher revenue from corporate lending and advisory, was partially offset by lower underwriting activity. There was a net credit recovery of $5 million this quarter compared to the provision of $14 million in the prior year. \r\nNoninterest expenses of $321 million were up $29 million from the prior year, primarily due to higher employee-related costs. Net income of $211 million was in line with the prior year. \r\nSlide 10 reflects the results of the corporate and other segment. The net loss for the quarter was $44 million compared with the net loss of $45 million in the prior year. Higher earnings in CIBC FirstCaribbean due to favorable foreign exchange and good credit performance was largely offset by lower investment gains. The current quarter also benefited from certain year-end tax credits. Losses in this segment have historically been in the $60 million to $70 million range and we would anticipate it being at that level going forward. \r\nCIBC's capital position remains strong. Our Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.8%, the same level as in the prior quarter. \r\nSolid organic capital generation was offset by the impact of higher risk-weighted assets, and our RWAs increased by $2 billion from the prior quarter as a result of strong growth in our lending portfolios.\r\nOur Basel III leverage ratio was 3.9%, which is well above the minimum required by our regulator. \r\nSo to wrap up, we're very pleased with our results this quarter which capped a record year in which we had strong performances from all of our businesses. \r\nIn 2015, we performed well against our medium-term financial objectives, with strong earnings growth and continued capital strength. Heading into 2016, we feel confident about delivering long-term value to our shareholders. \r\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the meeting over to Laura Dottori.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nThanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. I'll be referring to the risk section, which begins on Slide 13, where you'll see that loan losses came in at $198 million or 26 basis points, which is up $9 million or 1 basis point from the prior quarter. This was mainly due to higher losses in business banking related to 2 oil and gas accounts and that was partially offset by recoveries in our Capital Markets. \r\nTurning to Slide 14. New formations were up $64 million quarter-over-quarter due to the 2 accounts I mentioned earlier. You'll see that gross impaired loans were down, and that's primarily as a result of declines in CIBC FirstCaribbean and in the U.S. region. \r\nGross impaired loans as a percentage of gross loans and acceptances have trended down over the past few years and they've come in at 49 basis points this quarter. \r\nTo review our oil and gas portfolio, you'll see Slide 15 shows our corporate and business banking portfolios. We have $17.3 billion of direct exposure, which is down slightly from $17.4 billion last quarter. Our loans outstanding have declined $131 million or 2% quarter-over-quarter. 78% of our exposure is investment-grade and this has remained stable throughout the year. 56% of that is to exploration and production companies, with only 5% in the services space.\r\nOn Slide 16, you see our retail portfolio exposure to oil and gas, where we have $39 billion exposure to the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland, and that's up from $38 billion last quarter. If we exclude insured mortgages, we have $17 billion, which is unchanged from last year. \r\nOverall, our portfolio is performing as expected given the stressed oil prices. We continue to be vigilant and to proactively monitor our exposures.\r\nTurning to cards on Slide 17. You'll see that our net credit losses were $88 million this quarter, that's down $5 million from last quarter. And this is attributable to the seasonality as we typically see lower write-offs in our cards portfolio in the fourth quarter. \r\nIn the oil provinces, we've seen some increases in delinquencies, but this performance has been, as I mentioned earlier, as expected. The increase was mainly in the segment of customers with lower credit quality, which accounts for just over 1% of our total retail portfolio. \r\nThe overall cards portfolio continues to perform well. The delinquency increase in this quarter was driven by seasonal increase from the low levels in the summer. We continue to monitor our exposure in the oil provinces across all retail lending and remain cautious given that we are seeing increases in unemployment claims.\r\nOur Canadian residential mortgage portfolio is highlighted on Slide 18. As you can see, 64% of our portfolio is insured with 82% of the insurance being provided by the CMHC. The weighted average loan-to-value of our uninsured portfolio is 59% and has remained stable over the past year. \r\nCondo mortgages account for roughly 11% of our portfolio and the loan-to-value of the uninsured portion is 61%.\r\nSlide 19 shows our condo developer exposure, which continues to remain diversified across many projects, and both drawn and authorized loans have remained stable over the year. \r\nLastly, on Slide 20, this shows the distribution of revenue in our trading portfolios as compared with VaR. We had one negative trading day this quarter compared with none last quarter. Our average trading VaR was $3.9 million, roughly in line with last quarter at $3.7 million. \r\nI'll now turn things back to Geoff.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Geoffrey Weiss (Executives)】\nThanks, Laura. Well, that concludes our prepared remarks and we'll now move on to the Q&A. Operator, can we please have the first question on the phone?",
      "transcript_text3": "David, wanted to explore the loan growth that you had in your operations in terms of what's underpinning the mortgage growth as well as what you're seeing on the commercial side in terms of pricing pressure or what's going on in covenants with your competitors?\n\n---\n\nOkay. John, so growth is pretty broad-based in personal banking and business banking. By that, I mean, asset side, liability side, both showing growth. But you did mention specifically mortgages, so let's focus in there. A couple of drivers for the mortgage growth. And again, we have the dichotomy where we're coming out of the brokerage side -- the FirstLine mortgage broker side and then working on our own brand to grow that apart. So first comment I'd make is on FirstLine, we're still retaining about 50% of the balances, double the target we set out at the very beginning of that effort to come out of that brokerage channel. So that's what's happening on that side, and we focus on building our own brand. We are seeing substantive growth there for sure. It's working quite well, a couple of drivers, as I said. First is expanding the mobile channel. So as we continue to focus on remote banking and banking that fits the life of our clients, building out that remote channel of mobile advisers, we were certainly below where we needed to be. So as we've built that channel, that's had an impact on our growth rate, from 2 perspectives: MaRS relationship, folks out on the street; and two, as they've had the role for a while, their productivity has been improving as well. So kind of 2 elements of lift there. And then the second driver for growth in mortgages is just process improvement, couple of examples. On the credit adjudication side, we've tightened it up, sped it up. We're getting answers back to our clients faster. And even simple things like documentation, we refined it, simplified it, tightened it. So I'd like to believe there's 2 drivers, one is expanding the sales channel, mobile advisers and the productivity thereof; and two is just tightening our processes, making us quicker, faster, tighter when we respond to clients. Oh, and then you asked on the business side. So on the business side, we're seeing growth on the lending of about 10%. We've been seeing that for a while. I think that's sustainable. No doubt it's a competitive space, but we seem to be maintaining our margins. And on the deposit side, we're high single digits growth in that space as well. So I think there's nothing that would indicate that we're coming off of that. We see Alberta, which used to be -- is still a very much growth market. It was growing faster than the national average. Now it's growing slower than the national average, but it's still showing substantive growth.\n\n---\n\nGood, David. In your comments in -- on the margins for the consumer side, you're not actually seeing any pricing pressure or is this just because of the dynamics of the spread on the variable rates moving out?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So when I commented on pricing pressure, I thought you'd asked, John, about the business side, so I was speaking about business. So let me speak about margins on the personal side, go to that directly. So we've been guiding to stable NIMs for quite some time and outperforming a bit relative to that. So I think this year, up 3 basis points. This quarter up 1 basis point. As I look forward, I think maintaining a stable NIM is going to be a bit of a challenge from a couple of perspectives. From an industry perspective, like the low interest rates in our noninterest-sensitive ladders just continue to grind. And then the second is it's a competitive world for deposits. So we've shown substantive deposit growth and we'll continue to seek that deposit growth, but to do it requires promotional rates at a point in time; we're in with a promotional rate in the market now. So that puts near-term pressure on NIMs. I think it's the right thing to do. I'm confident it's the right thing to do for the long-term value of the franchise. But because of the noninterest-sensitive rate impact and just the level of competition for deposits in the market, there is pressure. On the personal banking side, there is pressure on NIMs in the industry and we'll continue to need to manage through that.\n\n---\n\nKevin, the capital ratio, the CET1 ratio, has been flat now for a couple of quarters, and I wonder if you can give us a better sense as to what's going on and whether there's any opportunity to return to more normal levels of growth in that ratio just based on retained earnings going forward. And then Victor, whether the fact that the ratio wasn't really moving up as much as it was colors your thoughts on the dividend growth.\n\n---\n\nSure, Rob, it's Kevin. Let me take the first part of that. So I'd say in, I think, back in Q1 of this year, we were actually up 50 basis points, but it's been relatively flat since then. And I think that essentially what's happened is our capital growth has been impacted by business growth and also changes in FX rates. And so if I look at the current quarter, again strong capital growth, but we did have the restructuring charge, which would have decreased the CET1 growth from that. And then offsetting that was regular business growth that you would have seen. So we had a couple of billion dollars of RWA growth. And so that would have offset that. I mean, going forward, we would anticipate a continued strong capital generation that would be offset to a certain extent by business growth and -- but overall, we continue to see increasing our capital ratios.\n\n---\n\nSo this number should migrate higher. I mean, even if it's 10 or 15 basis points a quarter, we should expect to see some growth in that ratio over time?\n\n---\n\nWell, absolutely. I mean, if I think -- even for this quarter, I think the restructuring charge was about 16 or 17 basis points, so -- in and of itself. So absent that, we'd have had a -- we'd have certainly have had that growth this quarter.\n\n---\n\nAnd Rob, as a follow-up on the dividend side, just consistent with all the messages we've delivered in the last numbers of quarters, we're just going to keep going at -- $0.03 a quarter is what we've been doing this year consistently, quarter-after-quarter, until we get to the upper end of our range, which is 50%. We're at 45.5% now, so we have room to move up.\n\n---\n\nA couple of quick questions. Victor, can you give us a sense of the timing? Or what's the talk around the potential increase in mortgage risk weights? It sounds like it's been kicked down the road a little bit. And then on -- for Laura, on the redetermination, you didn't mention average credit lines, how much they were cut and all that stuff. But I'm also interested in how many of these E&P firms had their loans restructured. So from revolving to terms, stuff like that, and if that just means we might see some credit issues a few months away if some of these clients or borrowers can't sell off the assets to repay the loans.\n\n---\n\nSo Gabriel, on your first question, as you know, I'm not the regulator, I'm not the Minister of Finance, so it's hard for me to predict where that's all going. But I look at what's happening around the world as you do, and other countries and other regulators, they're increasing their risk weights. I and the team here, we always plan for a more conservative stance, which is why we have a higher CET1 ratio in the event that, that does change. So I think we have to plan for that. The extent of the chance, I can't comment on, although I suspect over time, risk weights will increase but in such a way that the industry can continue to provide to Canadians, mortgages at a reasonable level to help them buy their homes that they wish to buy.\n\n---\n\nBut you don't expect it in the next couple of quarters, anything like that?\n\n---\n\nNow look, Gabriel, you know what? I don't know. I just -- as I said to you, the most important thing for us is how are we planning for this? Higher -- being at the higher end of CET1 in our peer group is something that we feel very comfortable with for a number of reasons, one of which is possible regulatory changes.\n\n---\n\nAll right, Gabriel.\n\n---\n\nI got one...\n\n---\n\nSorry, there were -- yes, it was one question that had various segments to it. So a nice way to go about it. On the borrowing base redetermination. So the majority of our clients have been through this redetermination calculation. And so what we've seen as it relates to our borrowing base facilities is a reduction in amounts of about 5%. And that's with our price deck that we've brought down about 15% from the previous one we were using. And so your other question within the one question was how many of the loans had been restructured, and I can tell you that at this point in time, very few. We're probably -- we're well under 10% of our borrowing base redeterminations that either have off-cycle determination dates or we've been discussing some form of extension. I would expect to see some increase in that number through 2016, particularly if oil continues to remain below $50 on a consistent basis.\n\n---\n\nVictor, you talked about online lending in your remarks. I was wondering if you could just give us a little color. As you think about this developing opportunity or platform, where is it going? And how big can it get? So what do you see in that regard?\n\n---\n\nWell, we see on both sides of the border emergence of players in this space. We saw OnDeck Capital sign a relationship with JPMorgan just 2 days ago. They're trying to provide faster, smarter, sharper adjudication to the Small Business segment. Thinking Capital is the Canadian equivalent of that. We believe that there is a gap to fill for our Small Business clients. And this adjudication process is data intensive, it's paperless, it's quick and it's something that our clients appreciate. The relationship we signed with Thinking Capital is an exclusive relationship. It also allows us to deepen our relationships with those clients not only from getting a small business loan but also opening up a small business banking account and a personal banking account. David, I don't know if you would like to add to that?\n\n---\n\nYes, just a couple of comments. If I go up a few thousand feet and picking up on what we talked about at Investor Day and as we transform our operations. So you kind of look at it in -- as we talked that day, about 3 horizons: we're innovating within our core banking; innovating within kind of boundaries to what we do currently and what we might be doing soon; and then the third horizon being innovations and stuff that's out there further. Thinking Capital's in horizon 2, all right? It's algorithm-based online lending, which is not exactly what we do currently but pretty close, and it's us learning and exploring in that space. It's critical for us, as Victor said in his opening comments, to be laser-like focused on meeting the needs of our clients. And this currently is a faster, tighter response to small business, which can be, in traditional banking, a bit clunkier and not as crisp as what's being done by FinTechs like Thinking Capital with algorithm-based lending. So hence, the partnership. It's good for Thinking Capital. It's good for us as we learn and explore in that space. And things we're doing in the third horizon are investments, in blockchain, Digital Currency Group. We're looking at cryptocurrencies. And then horizon 1, all the stuff we talked about at Investor Day where we're doing network transformation, just getting more digital in our operations and the kind of banking we do today. So Thinking Capital is in horizon 2, and it's a -- it's an important step for us to explore a space that we can learn from and make sure that we're meeting the needs of our clients as quickly and as effectively as possible as that space evolves.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just another quick question. The sequential drop in fixed-income trading revenue, is that all market related? Or is there anything else notable going on there?\n\n---\n\nMeny, why don't we get Harry Culham to answer that question?\n\n---\n\nActually, we are coming off a very strong trading performance in quarter 3 and -- which benefited from a combination of good client activity and market volatility. And quarter 4, on the other hand, had lower client activity really around uncertainty in the markets and lower activity coming out of the summer. If you look at the full annual trading revenues 2015 versus '14, we're very proud of the performance, where it's up significantly on '14.\n\n---\n\nBefore I get to my actual questions, just to clarify that on the trading side, were there any mark-to-market losses this quarter? It doesn't appear to be on Page 20 of your presentation. But anything you can help with there?\n\n---\n\nNot that -- there are no significant mark-to-market losses; nothing material.\n\n---\n\nMaybe the right way to ask it is, were there big mark-to-market gains in Q3 then?\n\n---\n\nWe had some significant transactions in quarter 3, all client-driven transactions that led to a very strong performance. In fact the first 3 quarters were very strong. Quarter 4 is essentially in line with quarter 4 last year, and we're actually off to a good start as we start quarter 1 here. The outlook is quite positive with some solid client activity in the first part of the quarter.\n\n---\n\nAnd did those significant client transactions in Q3 result in significant mark-to-market gains?\n\n---\n\nThere were -- yes, there were some significant gains from some client transactions. There were some larger transactions in quarter 3. This is -- as you well know, this is a well-diversified client franchise across various different products.\n\n---\n\nOkay, let me get to my actual question then. So David, you referred to -- actually, let me start it this way. From Q1 to Q3 -- sorry, Q1 to Q2 in domestic retail, there was a sharp change in the bank's performance, both earnings growth, operating leverage. It was like a switch got flipped. And what I'm thinking about going into 2016 is operating leverage in particular. The sort of operating leverage you've seen in these last 3 quarters, is that sustainable going into 2016 given the pressure on margins and your need or your desire to spend more aggressively in that business?\n\n---\n\nMario, yes, let's go back to the message at -- from Investor Day early October. So at that point, I had said that 2016 would be a challenge maintaining a positive operating leverage. And if you look to the last few quarters, you're right, they've been strong. And I got to say in particular, Q4 came in better than I anticipated. So if we de-comp it a bit, the expenses, which are just inside 4%, I think that's indicative of what we'll expect in the near term given our continued investment in the business. Revenue, I'd say, came in stronger than what I anticipated and may -- is, let me turn it to is -- stronger than what I anticipate in the near term. So my perspective for 2016 hasn't changed. On Investor Day, we talked about some of the investments that were lighting up currently. The simplifying of our leadership structure. We talked about moving clients into Imperial Service where they're better served there and out of core. We talked about our network transformation. We talked about investing in digital sales. So all those steps we're taking to make our bank better cause me to stay with the guidance that I provided at Investor Day.\n\n---\n\nAnd the guidance, to be clear, is challenge maintaining positive operating leverage?\n\n---\n\nThat's correct, Mario, yes.\n\n---\n\nJust to pick up on that, David, I was surprised to hear you say that even with this investment spend that you're contemplating for 2016, the expense growth level isn't likely to change. I had thought that was the lever that was more likely to push the operating leverage down in 2016 as opposed to revenue. So is there -- do you have some offsets in mind that is going to keep expense growth at this same level of 4% next year to offset the investment spend?\n\n---\n\nI guess I'd make a couple of comments. Like we're talking it's kind of near term as opposed to quarter-to-quarter. One thing that I'd say is that although we're a substantive enterprise, like $10 million moves operating leverage 1 percentage point. And $10 million isn't really a big number on the expense base that we're dealing with. It's about $1 billion-ish per quarter. So there's some -- there is some volatility. $10 million moves at a turn on operating leverage. So you'll see that number move around, as it has in the past. I'm guess I'm saying we have been investing. There are some specific things that we said on Investor Day that we want to do, and that will put some pressure on expenses for sure. And you'll see some movements in the quarter, especially, as I point out, $10 million can move at a turn. But I'm just saying that take, for example, the noninterest income line and -- which has been flat for some period of time. It's up this quarter about 20-ish. When I look at that number and dissect it, it's a whole lot of small items, many of which aren't reoccurring. So we just had a bit of a tailwind in Q4 that pushed us to a level beyond what I'd hoped for.\n\n---\n\nFair enough. That's clear. And then one final one for Victor. Victor, you've mentioned many times since taking the seat that getting the dividend ratio -- dividend payout ratio to the high end of the range is a target for the bank as long as earnings permit. I guess I wanted to ask you, what happens when you get to 50%? Have you discussed either with the board or with the regulator the possibility of taking it above the for now magic 50% mark? Would you want to do that? And is there capacity in terms of what the regulator thinks for you to move above 50% in the future?\n\n---\n\nI -- Sumit, I think we just -- we're going to move to 50%, and we're going to try and grow our earnings. And that way, we can continue to grow our dividends by growing our earnings. The payout range of 40% to 50% and being at the upper of that is where we feel comfortable, and that's really where the discussions have stopped. Our real focus is on how can we drive earnings growth, both from the top line and bottom line, and managing our costs better to deliver more value to our shareholders. That's the preoccupation of the leadership team at CIBC.\n\n---\n\nSo dividends go up because earnings go up and not because the payout ratio moves?\n\n---\n\nYes. Right.\n\n---\n\nJust maybe starting, Laura, can you talk a little bit about the evolution of your watch list over the past year and in general, and then specifically related to the evolution of the watch list on the energy book?\n\n---\n\nYes, overall watch list -- so across the organization has actually been very good. So we haven't seen any increases. In fact, I'd say it's been down a bit. As it relates specifically to the oil and gas space, we have seen increases in our watch list. However, none this past quarter. And I'd say that accounts that are of higher concern to us, there's about a handful of those.\n\n---\n\nSo it's -- so there hasn't been any change in the number of loans in the energy book on the watch list over the past year?\n\n---\n\nOh, there certainly have been over the last year. There haven't been this quarter. In fact, when we look across the broad spectrum of accounts, so including our Small Business accounts in the oil space, we've had 100 names that have been downgraded. And just to give you an idea, that represents an increase in our risk-weighted assets over the year of just under $400 million.\n\n---\n\nOkay, interesting. But overall, over the last year, your total watch list hasn't really moved? Your oil and gas has increased, but there's been changes elsewhere? Is that the right way to think of it?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just quickly, if I can sneak another one in here. On the Wealth Management aside, I noticed that your earnings were up 4% year-over-year, but your assets were up 12%. And if I recall at the Investor Day, about 71% of your Wealth Management earnings is driven by asset management. And so I'm just a little perplexed as to why you're not seeing more leveraged asset growth. And is there anything in the numbers that has caused the lack of leverage there?\n\n---\n\nIt's Steve. Overall, the quarter this year to quarter last year growth in assets is relatively consistent with the revenue growth. The real reason why our earnings this quarter were down somewhat from previous quarter is really just the market pullback that we saw primarily in August and September where the TSX was down about 8%. And so our revenues really were fairly much in line with the overall asset movement. And so that's really why we were down. But we still did produce 4% revenue growth, or 4% NIAT growth rather, Q4 this year to Q4 last year. So still positive but much less than the momentum we had been seeing previously.\n\n---\n\nI guess maybe yes, I'll -- maybe I'll follow up.\n\n---\n\nA question for David. Great mortgage results. I saw a report where CIBC is market leader in terms of mortgages for foreign investors in Vancouver. And at least one competitor now is making a push into that market, dropping their LTV limits to minimum 20% down. So how do you respond to these types of competitive threats?\n\n---\n\nPeter, no anticipated change on -- in that particular respect. We are strong in that region, and I'd like to believe it's the team we've got there -- and I know that may sound a bit generic, but it is a team that's very strong, been established there for quite some time, very connected within the community. We've got consistent support throughout the bank with risk and so forth, regarding the limits that we have established, have allowed us to be competitive. So yes, there's more of a push from one of the -- one of our competitors into the space. But I guess the simple statement would be we feel good about our position in that market, good about our team. And we'll just push on with what we're doing.\n\n---\n\nHow important is that market and maybe the Toronto market, which may be a bit smaller? But how important is that submarket to your overall mortgage growth?\n\n---\n\nWell, Ontario is a core market for us, generally, and Toronto, obviously, the epicenter within. So if you look at our mortgage book, which I think in Laura's side she's got it cut by province so we have it in our materials, so you can see that the center of Canada is strong for us. But when you actually look at those 2 cities as a percentage of our overall book, it's actually not that substantive. We're a broad-based Canadian lender, even into the smaller rural communities. So they're important, but the key thing is for us to be competitive in all the spaces that we're active. And Toronto and Vancouver are different from other markets. Rural markets have different dynamics. What we have done over the last few years is to change our pricing to reflect the dynamics in each of those markets, as where before we used to be kind of \"one price fits all\" across the country, which oversimplifies the dynamics within our country.\n\n---\n\nAnd just on credit, you mentioned you do credit mitigation. Per se, the high-net-worth foreign buyer that puts 20% down on a home, I mean, obviously, they would have financial assets beyond just their home. What credit mitigation techniques do you use? I mean, I guess the question I'm asking is, do you ensure that you have assets custodied in Canada when you do that type of business?\n\n---\n\nMaybe what I'll do is just hand over to Laura, who's my colleague, to make sure that what we're doing as we pursue growth is appropriate in nature. So I'll hand over to Laura and she can comment.\n\n---\n\nSo I would say we absolutely qualify all of our borrowers. And if we are making loans where we're taking security, particularly in the mortgage space, of course the security we're taking is in this country. And just to elaborate a bit as it relates to sort of nonresident Canadians, the percentage of our portfolio, as David said, is really small. It's under 1%.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So this isn't a huge driver? Okay.\n\n---\n\nNot a huge driver. And I'd also tell you that from a delinquency perspective or performance perspective, it's a very well-performing segment of our book. It just happens to be an incredibly-small one.\n\n---\n\nYes, but the new resident would be a lot bigger. So people coming to Canada and staying here.\n\n---\n\nYes. You're right, it would be. And again, the same, we do all the qualifications for all borrowers. And what I can tell you as it relates to our mortgage growth, most of it or -- for that segment is coming out of Vancouver and Toronto. And our originations actually look quite good in performance to-date. So we've got really good profiles. And in fact, when we look at our late-stage delinquencies in that segment, we're actually down in the Greater Toronto area and in British Columbia.\n\n---\n\nBut -- so I just wanted to stand back a little bit and look at that at a bit higher level. You've obviously had pretty good ROEs even on higher capital ratios. At the Investor Day, you talked about a medium-term target of 18% to 20%. I mean, if you had a chance to revisit that, would you stick with it or would you really reduce the lower end of that range?\n\n---\n\nIt was only 6 weeks ago, Sohrab, so we...\n\n---\n\nBut I think the world has changed quite a bit even since.\n\n---\n\nThe world keeps changing week after week. We were at the high end of ROEs for banks of our size around the world. And I don't think that the 20% level is something that's sustainable. I think competition will continue to eat away at that and we're prepared to deal with it. We're not prepared for a precipitous drop in ROE. Is 18% the right number? Is 18.5%, 17.5%? I'm not sure, but all I can tell you is we're guiding that ROE will drift downwards over time. And what we were clear about in the investor presentation is we want to get to an earnings per share profile of 5% to 10%. We want to be well within that range in 1.5 years from now. We want to get our NIX ratio down to 55%, a run rate in the medium term at that level. ROE will be in the 18% to 20% range and dividends will be at the upper end of 50%. We're really just focusing on core quality earnings growth, staying close to our clients in all our businesses, working across all of our businesses and just delivering good, old-fashioned earnings growth to our shareholders and, hopefully, share price appreciation with that.\n\n---\n\nA quick question for David on the strong mortgage growth that you've been seeing. In terms of new originations, can you tell us roughly how meaningful the contribution is on the -- or from the 5% cashback offer? And as a quick follow-up, in your view, is the risk profile for someone who chooses that product meaningfully different than your average mortgage borrower?\n\n---\n\nWell, I'll answer the first bit and maybe hand over to Laura for the second bit. To be honest, it's not that meaningful. The key thing, to be honest, is it's a discussion point for our front line to have with clients and to have a basis to reach out to clients who don't currently have their mortgage with us. It's more a tool to facilitate that conversation and to catalyze the focus of our front-line team on that area to continue to push for the deeper relationships that we seek as a fundamental part of our strategy. Regarding those that we do book and the credit risk associated with them, I'll turn to Laura, if I could.\n\n---\n\nYes, Mike, similar to my earlier comment, risk profile actually tends to be better as it relates to Beacon scores, loan-to-values, delinquencies.\n\n---\n\nThank you. So that concludes our call. If there are any follow-up questions, please call our Investor Relations department. Thanks again for joining us this morning. And on behalf of the team at CIBC, I'd like to wish everyone a happy and safe holiday season.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: John Aiken (Analysts)】\nDavid, wanted to explore the loan growth that you had in your operations in terms of what's underpinning the mortgage growth as well as what you're seeing on the commercial side in terms of pricing pressure or what's going on in covenants with your competitors?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nOkay. John, so growth is pretty broad-based in personal banking and business banking. By that, I mean, asset side, liability side, both showing growth. But you did mention specifically mortgages, so let's focus in there. A couple of drivers for the mortgage growth. And again, we have the dichotomy where we're coming out of the brokerage side -- the FirstLine mortgage broker side and then working on our own brand to grow that apart. So first comment I'd make is on FirstLine, we're still retaining about 50% of the balances, double the target we set out at the very beginning of that effort to come out of that brokerage channel. So that's what's happening on that side, and we focus on building our own brand. We are seeing substantive growth there for sure. It's working quite well, a couple of drivers, as I said. First is expanding the mobile channel. So as we continue to focus on remote banking and banking that fits the life of our clients, building out that remote channel of mobile advisers, we were certainly below where we needed to be. So as we've built that channel, that's had an impact on our growth rate, from 2 perspectives: MaRS relationship, folks out on the street; and two, as they've had the role for a while, their productivity has been improving as well. So kind of 2 elements of lift there. And then the second driver for growth in mortgages is just process improvement, couple of examples. On the credit adjudication side, we've tightened it up, sped it up. We're getting answers back to our clients faster. And even simple things like documentation, we refined it, simplified it, tightened it. So I'd like to believe there's 2 drivers, one is expanding the sales channel, mobile advisers and the productivity thereof; and two is just tightening our processes, making us quicker, faster, tighter when we respond to clients. Oh, and then you asked on the business side. So on the business side, we're seeing growth on the lending of about 10%. We've been seeing that for a while. I think that's sustainable. No doubt it's a competitive space, but we seem to be maintaining our margins. And on the deposit side, we're high single digits growth in that space as well. So I think there's nothing that would indicate that we're coming off of that. We see Alberta, which used to be -- is still a very much growth market. It was growing faster than the national average. Now it's growing slower than the national average, but it's still showing substantive growth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Aiken (Analysts)】\nGood, David. In your comments in -- on the margins for the consumer side, you're not actually seeing any pricing pressure or is this just because of the dynamics of the spread on the variable rates moving out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nOkay. So when I commented on pricing pressure, I thought you'd asked, John, about the business side, so I was speaking about business. So let me speak about margins on the personal side, go to that directly. So we've been guiding to stable NIMs for quite some time and outperforming a bit relative to that. So I think this year, up 3 basis points. This quarter up 1 basis point. As I look forward, I think maintaining a stable NIM is going to be a bit of a challenge from a couple of perspectives. From an industry perspective, like the low interest rates in our noninterest-sensitive ladders just continue to grind. And then the second is it's a competitive world for deposits. So we've shown substantive deposit growth and we'll continue to seek that deposit growth, but to do it requires promotional rates at a point in time; we're in with a promotional rate in the market now. So that puts near-term pressure on NIMs. I think it's the right thing to do. I'm confident it's the right thing to do for the long-term value of the franchise. But because of the noninterest-sensitive rate impact and just the level of competition for deposits in the market, there is pressure. On the personal banking side, there is pressure on NIMs in the industry and we'll continue to need to manage through that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Sedran (Analysts)】\nKevin, the capital ratio, the CET1 ratio, has been flat now for a couple of quarters, and I wonder if you can give us a better sense as to what's going on and whether there's any opportunity to return to more normal levels of growth in that ratio just based on retained earnings going forward. And then Victor, whether the fact that the ratio wasn't really moving up as much as it was colors your thoughts on the dividend growth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kevin Glass (Executives)】\nSure, Rob, it's Kevin. Let me take the first part of that. So I'd say in, I think, back in Q1 of this year, we were actually up 50 basis points, but it's been relatively flat since then. And I think that essentially what's happened is our capital growth has been impacted by business growth and also changes in FX rates. And so if I look at the current quarter, again strong capital growth, but we did have the restructuring charge, which would have decreased the CET1 growth from that. And then offsetting that was regular business growth that you would have seen. So we had a couple of billion dollars of RWA growth. And so that would have offset that. I mean, going forward, we would anticipate a continued strong capital generation that would be offset to a certain extent by business growth and -- but overall, we continue to see increasing our capital ratios.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Sedran (Analysts)】\nSo this number should migrate higher. I mean, even if it's 10 or 15 basis points a quarter, we should expect to see some growth in that ratio over time?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kevin Glass (Executives)】\nWell, absolutely. I mean, if I think -- even for this quarter, I think the restructuring charge was about 16 or 17 basis points, so -- in and of itself. So absent that, we'd have had a -- we'd have certainly have had that growth this quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nAnd Rob, as a follow-up on the dividend side, just consistent with all the messages we've delivered in the last numbers of quarters, we're just going to keep going at -- $0.03 a quarter is what we've been doing this year consistently, quarter-after-quarter, until we get to the upper end of our range, which is 50%. We're at 45.5% now, so we have room to move up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gabriel Dechaine (Analysts)】\nA couple of quick questions. Victor, can you give us a sense of the timing? Or what's the talk around the potential increase in mortgage risk weights? It sounds like it's been kicked down the road a little bit. And then on -- for Laura, on the redetermination, you didn't mention average credit lines, how much they were cut and all that stuff. But I'm also interested in how many of these E&P firms had their loans restructured. So from revolving to terms, stuff like that, and if that just means we might see some credit issues a few months away if some of these clients or borrowers can't sell off the assets to repay the loans.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nSo Gabriel, on your first question, as you know, I'm not the regulator, I'm not the Minister of Finance, so it's hard for me to predict where that's all going. But I look at what's happening around the world as you do, and other countries and other regulators, they're increasing their risk weights. I and the team here, we always plan for a more conservative stance, which is why we have a higher CET1 ratio in the event that, that does change. So I think we have to plan for that. The extent of the chance, I can't comment on, although I suspect over time, risk weights will increase but in such a way that the industry can continue to provide to Canadians, mortgages at a reasonable level to help them buy their homes that they wish to buy.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gabriel Dechaine (Analysts)】\nBut you don't expect it in the next couple of quarters, anything like that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nNow look, Gabriel, you know what? I don't know. I just -- as I said to you, the most important thing for us is how are we planning for this? Higher -- being at the higher end of CET1 in our peer group is something that we feel very comfortable with for a number of reasons, one of which is possible regulatory changes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nAll right, Gabriel.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gabriel Dechaine (Analysts)】\nI got one...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nSorry, there were -- yes, it was one question that had various segments to it. So a nice way to go about it. On the borrowing base redetermination. So the majority of our clients have been through this redetermination calculation. And so what we've seen as it relates to our borrowing base facilities is a reduction in amounts of about 5%. And that's with our price deck that we've brought down about 15% from the previous one we were using. And so your other question within the one question was how many of the loans had been restructured, and I can tell you that at this point in time, very few. We're probably -- we're well under 10% of our borrowing base redeterminations that either have off-cycle determination dates or we've been discussing some form of extension. I would expect to see some increase in that number through 2016, particularly if oil continues to remain below $50 on a consistent basis.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meny Grauman (Analysts)】\nVictor, you talked about online lending in your remarks. I was wondering if you could just give us a little color. As you think about this developing opportunity or platform, where is it going? And how big can it get? So what do you see in that regard?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nWell, we see on both sides of the border emergence of players in this space. We saw OnDeck Capital sign a relationship with JPMorgan just 2 days ago. They're trying to provide faster, smarter, sharper adjudication to the Small Business segment. Thinking Capital is the Canadian equivalent of that. We believe that there is a gap to fill for our Small Business clients. And this adjudication process is data intensive, it's paperless, it's quick and it's something that our clients appreciate. The relationship we signed with Thinking Capital is an exclusive relationship. It also allows us to deepen our relationships with those clients not only from getting a small business loan but also opening up a small business banking account and a personal banking account. David, I don't know if you would like to add to that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nYes, just a couple of comments. If I go up a few thousand feet and picking up on what we talked about at Investor Day and as we transform our operations. So you kind of look at it in -- as we talked that day, about 3 horizons: we're innovating within our core banking; innovating within kind of boundaries to what we do currently and what we might be doing soon; and then the third horizon being innovations and stuff that's out there further. Thinking Capital's in horizon 2, all right? It's algorithm-based online lending, which is not exactly what we do currently but pretty close, and it's us learning and exploring in that space. It's critical for us, as Victor said in his opening comments, to be laser-like focused on meeting the needs of our clients. And this currently is a faster, tighter response to small business, which can be, in traditional banking, a bit clunkier and not as crisp as what's being done by FinTechs like Thinking Capital with algorithm-based lending. So hence, the partnership. It's good for Thinking Capital. It's good for us as we learn and explore in that space. And things we're doing in the third horizon are investments, in blockchain, Digital Currency Group. We're looking at cryptocurrencies. And then horizon 1, all the stuff we talked about at Investor Day where we're doing network transformation, just getting more digital in our operations and the kind of banking we do today. So Thinking Capital is in horizon 2, and it's a -- it's an important step for us to explore a space that we can learn from and make sure that we're meeting the needs of our clients as quickly and as effectively as possible as that space evolves.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meny Grauman (Analysts)】\nAnd then just another quick question. The sequential drop in fixed-income trading revenue, is that all market related? Or is there anything else notable going on there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nMeny, why don't we get Harry Culham to answer that question?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Harry Culham (Executives)】\nActually, we are coming off a very strong trading performance in quarter 3 and -- which benefited from a combination of good client activity and market volatility. And quarter 4, on the other hand, had lower client activity really around uncertainty in the markets and lower activity coming out of the summer. If you look at the full annual trading revenues 2015 versus '14, we're very proud of the performance, where it's up significantly on '14.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mario Mendonca (Analysts)】\nBefore I get to my actual questions, just to clarify that on the trading side, were there any mark-to-market losses this quarter? It doesn't appear to be on Page 20 of your presentation. But anything you can help with there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kevin Glass (Executives)】\nNot that -- there are no significant mark-to-market losses; nothing material.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mario Mendonca (Analysts)】\nMaybe the right way to ask it is, were there big mark-to-market gains in Q3 then?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kevin Glass (Executives)】\nWe had some significant transactions in quarter 3, all client-driven transactions that led to a very strong performance. In fact the first 3 quarters were very strong. Quarter 4 is essentially in line with quarter 4 last year, and we're actually off to a good start as we start quarter 1 here. The outlook is quite positive with some solid client activity in the first part of the quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mario Mendonca (Analysts)】\nAnd did those significant client transactions in Q3 result in significant mark-to-market gains?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kevin Glass (Executives)】\nThere were -- yes, there were some significant gains from some client transactions. There were some larger transactions in quarter 3. This is -- as you well know, this is a well-diversified client franchise across various different products.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mario Mendonca (Analysts)】\nOkay, let me get to my actual question then. So David, you referred to -- actually, let me start it this way. From Q1 to Q3 -- sorry, Q1 to Q2 in domestic retail, there was a sharp change in the bank's performance, both earnings growth, operating leverage. It was like a switch got flipped. And what I'm thinking about going into 2016 is operating leverage in particular. The sort of operating leverage you've seen in these last 3 quarters, is that sustainable going into 2016 given the pressure on margins and your need or your desire to spend more aggressively in that business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nMario, yes, let's go back to the message at -- from Investor Day early October. So at that point, I had said that 2016 would be a challenge maintaining a positive operating leverage. And if you look to the last few quarters, you're right, they've been strong. And I got to say in particular, Q4 came in better than I anticipated. So if we de-comp it a bit, the expenses, which are just inside 4%, I think that's indicative of what we'll expect in the near term given our continued investment in the business. Revenue, I'd say, came in stronger than what I anticipated and may -- is, let me turn it to is -- stronger than what I anticipate in the near term. So my perspective for 2016 hasn't changed. On Investor Day, we talked about some of the investments that were lighting up currently. The simplifying of our leadership structure. We talked about moving clients into Imperial Service where they're better served there and out of core. We talked about our network transformation. We talked about investing in digital sales. So all those steps we're taking to make our bank better cause me to stay with the guidance that I provided at Investor Day.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mario Mendonca (Analysts)】\nAnd the guidance, to be clear, is challenge maintaining positive operating leverage?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nThat's correct, Mario, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sumit Malhotra (Analysts)】\nJust to pick up on that, David, I was surprised to hear you say that even with this investment spend that you're contemplating for 2016, the expense growth level isn't likely to change. I had thought that was the lever that was more likely to push the operating leverage down in 2016 as opposed to revenue. So is there -- do you have some offsets in mind that is going to keep expense growth at this same level of 4% next year to offset the investment spend?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nI guess I'd make a couple of comments. Like we're talking it's kind of near term as opposed to quarter-to-quarter. One thing that I'd say is that although we're a substantive enterprise, like $10 million moves operating leverage 1 percentage point. And $10 million isn't really a big number on the expense base that we're dealing with. It's about $1 billion-ish per quarter. So there's some -- there is some volatility. $10 million moves at a turn on operating leverage. So you'll see that number move around, as it has in the past. I'm guess I'm saying we have been investing. There are some specific things that we said on Investor Day that we want to do, and that will put some pressure on expenses for sure. And you'll see some movements in the quarter, especially, as I point out, $10 million can move at a turn. But I'm just saying that take, for example, the noninterest income line and -- which has been flat for some period of time. It's up this quarter about 20-ish. When I look at that number and dissect it, it's a whole lot of small items, many of which aren't reoccurring. So we just had a bit of a tailwind in Q4 that pushed us to a level beyond what I'd hoped for.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sumit Malhotra (Analysts)】\nFair enough. That's clear. And then one final one for Victor. Victor, you've mentioned many times since taking the seat that getting the dividend ratio -- dividend payout ratio to the high end of the range is a target for the bank as long as earnings permit. I guess I wanted to ask you, what happens when you get to 50%? Have you discussed either with the board or with the regulator the possibility of taking it above the for now magic 50% mark? Would you want to do that? And is there capacity in terms of what the regulator thinks for you to move above 50% in the future?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nI -- Sumit, I think we just -- we're going to move to 50%, and we're going to try and grow our earnings. And that way, we can continue to grow our dividends by growing our earnings. The payout range of 40% to 50% and being at the upper of that is where we feel comfortable, and that's really where the discussions have stopped. Our real focus is on how can we drive earnings growth, both from the top line and bottom line, and managing our costs better to deliver more value to our shareholders. That's the preoccupation of the leadership team at CIBC.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sumit Malhotra (Analysts)】\nSo dividends go up because earnings go up and not because the payout ratio moves?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nYes. Right.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Doug Young (Analysts)】\nJust maybe starting, Laura, can you talk a little bit about the evolution of your watch list over the past year and in general, and then specifically related to the evolution of the watch list on the energy book?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nYes, overall watch list -- so across the organization has actually been very good. So we haven't seen any increases. In fact, I'd say it's been down a bit. As it relates specifically to the oil and gas space, we have seen increases in our watch list. However, none this past quarter. And I'd say that accounts that are of higher concern to us, there's about a handful of those.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Doug Young (Analysts)】\nSo it's -- so there hasn't been any change in the number of loans in the energy book on the watch list over the past year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nOh, there certainly have been over the last year. There haven't been this quarter. In fact, when we look across the broad spectrum of accounts, so including our Small Business accounts in the oil space, we've had 100 names that have been downgraded. And just to give you an idea, that represents an increase in our risk-weighted assets over the year of just under $400 million.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Doug Young (Analysts)】\nOkay, interesting. But overall, over the last year, your total watch list hasn't really moved? Your oil and gas has increased, but there's been changes elsewhere? Is that the right way to think of it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Doug Young (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just quickly, if I can sneak another one in here. On the Wealth Management aside, I noticed that your earnings were up 4% year-over-year, but your assets were up 12%. And if I recall at the Investor Day, about 71% of your Wealth Management earnings is driven by asset management. And so I'm just a little perplexed as to why you're not seeing more leveraged asset growth. And is there anything in the numbers that has caused the lack of leverage there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Geist (Executives)】\nIt's Steve. Overall, the quarter this year to quarter last year growth in assets is relatively consistent with the revenue growth. The real reason why our earnings this quarter were down somewhat from previous quarter is really just the market pullback that we saw primarily in August and September where the TSX was down about 8%. And so our revenues really were fairly much in line with the overall asset movement. And so that's really why we were down. But we still did produce 4% revenue growth, or 4% NIAT growth rather, Q4 this year to Q4 last year. So still positive but much less than the momentum we had been seeing previously.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Doug Young (Analysts)】\nI guess maybe yes, I'll -- maybe I'll follow up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Routledge (Analysts)】\nA question for David. Great mortgage results. I saw a report where CIBC is market leader in terms of mortgages for foreign investors in Vancouver. And at least one competitor now is making a push into that market, dropping their LTV limits to minimum 20% down. So how do you respond to these types of competitive threats?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nPeter, no anticipated change on -- in that particular respect. We are strong in that region, and I'd like to believe it's the team we've got there -- and I know that may sound a bit generic, but it is a team that's very strong, been established there for quite some time, very connected within the community. We've got consistent support throughout the bank with risk and so forth, regarding the limits that we have established, have allowed us to be competitive. So yes, there's more of a push from one of the -- one of our competitors into the space. But I guess the simple statement would be we feel good about our position in that market, good about our team. And we'll just push on with what we're doing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Routledge (Analysts)】\nHow important is that market and maybe the Toronto market, which may be a bit smaller? But how important is that submarket to your overall mortgage growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nWell, Ontario is a core market for us, generally, and Toronto, obviously, the epicenter within. So if you look at our mortgage book, which I think in Laura's side she's got it cut by province so we have it in our materials, so you can see that the center of Canada is strong for us. But when you actually look at those 2 cities as a percentage of our overall book, it's actually not that substantive. We're a broad-based Canadian lender, even into the smaller rural communities. So they're important, but the key thing is for us to be competitive in all the spaces that we're active. And Toronto and Vancouver are different from other markets. Rural markets have different dynamics. What we have done over the last few years is to change our pricing to reflect the dynamics in each of those markets, as where before we used to be kind of \"one price fits all\" across the country, which oversimplifies the dynamics within our country.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Routledge (Analysts)】\nAnd just on credit, you mentioned you do credit mitigation. Per se, the high-net-worth foreign buyer that puts 20% down on a home, I mean, obviously, they would have financial assets beyond just their home. What credit mitigation techniques do you use? I mean, I guess the question I'm asking is, do you ensure that you have assets custodied in Canada when you do that type of business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nMaybe what I'll do is just hand over to Laura, who's my colleague, to make sure that what we're doing as we pursue growth is appropriate in nature. So I'll hand over to Laura and she can comment.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nSo I would say we absolutely qualify all of our borrowers. And if we are making loans where we're taking security, particularly in the mortgage space, of course the security we're taking is in this country. And just to elaborate a bit as it relates to sort of nonresident Canadians, the percentage of our portfolio, as David said, is really small. It's under 1%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Routledge (Analysts)】\nOkay. So this isn't a huge driver? Okay.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nNot a huge driver. And I'd also tell you that from a delinquency perspective or performance perspective, it's a very well-performing segment of our book. It just happens to be an incredibly-small one.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Routledge (Analysts)】\nYes, but the new resident would be a lot bigger. So people coming to Canada and staying here.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nYes. You're right, it would be. And again, the same, we do all the qualifications for all borrowers. And what I can tell you as it relates to our mortgage growth, most of it or -- for that segment is coming out of Vancouver and Toronto. And our originations actually look quite good in performance to-date. So we've got really good profiles. And in fact, when we look at our late-stage delinquencies in that segment, we're actually down in the Greater Toronto area and in British Columbia.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sohrab Movahedi (Analysts)】\nBut -- so I just wanted to stand back a little bit and look at that at a bit higher level. You've obviously had pretty good ROEs even on higher capital ratios. At the Investor Day, you talked about a medium-term target of 18% to 20%. I mean, if you had a chance to revisit that, would you stick with it or would you really reduce the lower end of that range?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nIt was only 6 weeks ago, Sohrab, so we...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sohrab Movahedi (Analysts)】\nBut I think the world has changed quite a bit even since.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Victor Dodig (Executives)】\nThe world keeps changing week after week. We were at the high end of ROEs for banks of our size around the world. And I don't think that the 20% level is something that's sustainable. I think competition will continue to eat away at that and we're prepared to deal with it. We're not prepared for a precipitous drop in ROE. Is 18% the right number? Is 18.5%, 17.5%? I'm not sure, but all I can tell you is we're guiding that ROE will drift downwards over time. And what we were clear about in the investor presentation is we want to get to an earnings per share profile of 5% to 10%. We want to be well within that range in 1.5 years from now. We want to get our NIX ratio down to 55%, a run rate in the medium term at that level. ROE will be in the 18% to 20% range and dividends will be at the upper end of 50%. We're really just focusing on core quality earnings growth, staying close to our clients in all our businesses, working across all of our businesses and just delivering good, old-fashioned earnings growth to our shareholders and, hopefully, share price appreciation with that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mehmed Rizvanovic (Analysts)】\nA quick question for David on the strong mortgage growth that you've been seeing. In terms of new originations, can you tell us roughly how meaningful the contribution is on the -- or from the 5% cashback offer? And as a quick follow-up, in your view, is the risk profile for someone who chooses that product meaningfully different than your average mortgage borrower?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Williamson (Executives)】\nWell, I'll answer the first bit and maybe hand over to Laura for the second bit. To be honest, it's not that meaningful. The key thing, to be honest, is it's a discussion point for our front line to have with clients and to have a basis to reach out to clients who don't currently have their mortgage with us. It's more a tool to facilitate that conversation and to catalyze the focus of our front-line team on that area to continue to push for the deeper relationships that we seek as a fundamental part of our strategy. Regarding those that we do book and the credit risk associated with them, I'll turn to Laura, if I could.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laura Dottori-Attanasio (Executives)】\nYes, Mike, similar to my earlier comment, risk profile actually tends to be better as it relates to Beacon scores, loan-to-values, delinquencies.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Geoffrey Weiss (Executives)】\nThank you. So that concludes our call. If there are any follow-up questions, please call our Investor Relations department. Thanks again for joining us this morning. And on behalf of the team at CIBC, I'd like to wish everyone a happy and safe holiday season.",

      "transcript_text1": "All right. Thank you very much for joining us tonight. I also want to thank those of you that are joining us via webcast. And for those of you not in the room, I'm Bob Livingston, President and CEO of Dover. Tonight, I'll share some comments with you on our business followed by a short Q&A. So with that let's move to Slide 3. \r\nOur strategy at Dover remains consistent. We own great businesses that are leaders in their markets, have deep engagement with our customers and have ample opportunities for growth. And here's how we think about growing our business. We invest in markets that offer opportunities for growth and in sectors where customers value our engineering content and product performance. Within these key market sectors, we own and build businesses with an objective of creating scale, broadening our applications and expanding our geographic reach. Within the individual operating companies, we invest to drive growth and to create technology leadership that ultimately leads to superior product performance. Across our businesses, we bring innovation to customers in both developing as well as mature applications, and we embrace our strong entrepreneurial culture that, first and foremost, focuses on achievements with our customers. \r\nBy executing on our strategy over the last 6 years, we have made significant changes. Our business profile is more focused. We're very well positioned with our customers, and we have improved our ability to create value for our shareholders. If you ask me what makes Dover unique, unquestionably, my answer would be our close engagement with our customers. Our deep understanding of our customers' needs and our capabilities to deliver solutions enables them to win in their markets. This deep engagement with the customer is consistent across the 4 segments, and it defines who we are and how we operate. It does distinguish us in the marketplace. Our efforts around productivity and continuous improvement remain a priority and are driven by our Dover excellence program. This program drives productivity for both expansion of margin as well as for funding internal investment. The Dover excellence program has had a significant impact and continues to unlock further value for us. \r\nHaving just reviewed our strategy, let me talk about creating value over the next 5 years. We hold strong positions in these markets and our businesses are market leaders. But just as important are the common threads shared by all of our businesses serving these markets, including significant growth potential and pursuit of geographic expansion, substantial investment in sales and service capabilities and multiple M&A opportunities to enhance our positions and build our scale, capabilities and importance to our customers. \r\nLet me touch upon a few of these markets in more detail. In Energy, even with the recent downturn in this market, we are still very encouraged by this segment's long-term growth prospects. Our product portfolio has expanded, and we have substantial potential for geographic expansion. We intend to continue to build our capability, as we believe the outlook for this market is strong. \r\nUsing 2015 as a base and with the anticipation of another tough year in 2016, we believe our upstream business can grow 5% to 9% per year, depending on the trend of the oil price curve over the next 5 years. The pumps market continues to have a strong outlook, and we like our position in this space. We have the ability to capitalize on our broad product offering in developed countries along with the rising middle class in emerging economies, which drives what we see as an increase in the demand for food and beverage and pharmaceuticals. We are also well positioned to capitalize on numerous product adjacencies. \r\nIn printing and identification, the increased demand for marking and coding continues, driven by growing consumerism in developing economies along with health and safety concerns. We will continue to invest in local sales and service capabilities in areas that offer opportunities for growth, such as China, India, Southeast Asia, Turkey and even the United States. And we will maintain our strong focus on product innovation. \r\nLet's turn to the digital textile market, which is estimated to be about $1 billion in size. This market is in the early stages of converting from analog to digital. Favorable tailwinds will certainly push conversion rates higher. This market is expected to grow more than 10% annually through 2020, driven by fashion trends, just-in-time manufacturing and the need for a more sustainable production process. \r\nThe businesses highlighted here account for a significant majority of our revenue. It's not surprising that this is where we invest the bulk of our time and effort to drive greater value for our customers as well as our shareholders. We like our market positions and the opportunities to create value over the long term. \r\nLet me move now to product innovation. Across Dover, our businesses continue to focus on innovation and product development, faster cycles of innovation and expanding on our leading technologies. Let me highlight a few examples. \r\nIn the upper left on this screen, you can see the new JP3, our new entry-level printer launched by MS just last quarter. This printer is perfect for larger customers who want to print sample runs before running high-production runs on our larger printers. It's also ideal for first-time entrants to the digital textile printing market. \r\nIn the upper right, you'll see an Anthony vacuum glass door. This door offers our retail refrigeration customers a much thinner profile with greater energy efficiency. This product saves about $125 per year per door and does a much better job of merchandising the products. It is now in field testing with customers, and we're receiving very positive feedback. \r\nOn the lower right is our EnviroGear pump. This pump features a patented seal-less design that effectively eliminates leaks and reduces mechanical wear. This results in a highest level of safety when handling hazardous chemicals. \r\nOn the lower left is the Dover artificial lift horizontal pump, which is based on our ESP downhole technology. This pump is designed for injecting and disposing of surface water related to oil and gas production. This product launch represents a significant market entry for us both domestically and internationally. \r\nA few more examples that aren't pictured here. In our Energy automation business, we have successfully launched our new state-of-the-art SPIRIT-branded controller for rod pumping. This product helps our customers improve their well productivity by combining advanced analytics with an easy-to-use operator interface. \r\nLast quarter, PSG introduced a heavy-duty collision repair line for trucks, trailers and buses. This new line meets customers' requests to help improve technician ergonomics, shop efficiency and repair quality. \r\nOPW's new composite tank filling system allows our customers to fill their storage tanks while maintaining the highest level of environmental protection and preventing water intrusion. By the way, this new product was made possible as a result of technology from Fibrelite, a company we acquired 2 years ago. \r\nThe key message here is that over the last several years, we have focused on new products and technologies that will deliver incremental revenue of more than $85 million in 2016. Across Dover, we're committed to continuing our pursuit to drive innovation. One example comes from Fluids, where they are establishing skill-based centers of engineering excellence outside of North America, in India, China and Poland. It's also interesting to know that at our innovation center in Bangalore, we now have a staff of nearly 300 engineers. That's double the number from 5 years ago, and we expect the number of engineers in India to significantly expand in the next 2 to 3 years. \r\nAs you know, we've recently announced several acquisitions. Let me tell you how these additions help to build an even stronger Dover. Tokheim is a leading manufacturer of fuel dispensers, retail automation systems and payment systems. When joined with OPW, the combined product offerings will further enhance our strong position in retail fueling equipment. We will now be a leading retail fueling systems provider, featuring a full station-in-a-box offering. And an important note, there is no overlap of products here. Tokheim brings a completely complementary set of product offerings. \r\nCombined, this business becomes a nearly $1 billion global player with a strong margin profile. \r\nStaying within Fluids. Let me comment on the recent acquisitions of Gala and Reduction. When joined with Maag, these businesses will provide us with a more comprehensive solution for our customers in the plastics and polymers markets. Our equipment cuts plastics into pellets for use in countless applications such as PVC piping, water bottles, the increasing use of plastics in automotive products and in synthetic fibers. Combined, these 3 businesses now generate revenue of nearly $300 million and provide us with significant synergies and a very attractive long-term growth rate. \r\nOur acquisition of JK builds upon our market-leading position in the digital textile printing market. This market is undergoing rapid growth, as textile producers are in their early stages of converting from analog to digital. Digital printing technology allows the fashion industry to shrink time to market while also reducing cost. We firmly believe this will be an area of growth. Similar to Markem-Imaje, this acquisition enables us to develop a closed model to deliver consistent and superior print quality and offer complete integrated solutions. And by the way, both JK and MS are both leaders in their respective spaces. \r\nBefore we look at 2016, let me provide an update on Q4. Overall, macro market conditions have been difficult. In particular, oil and gas-related markets have experienced further weakening in the past few weeks. Continued weakness in China has also impacted our businesses. We now expect our full-year EPS to be approximately $3.62, which includes $0.07 of incremental restructuring and deal-related costs. That said, we are encouraged by the solid bookings we are seeing in several of our businesses, though we are cautious with respect to our customers accepting shipments as we exit the year. A bridge of the revised guidance can be found in the appendix of our presentation deck. \r\nWe are continuing to focus on cost-management initiatives that will enhance the cost base of our business. On the acquisition side, we closed 3 deals in the quarter and expect Tokheim to close early in 2016. These acquisitions will deliver over $500 million in revenue next year, and we will absorb some acquisition costs this quarter in connection with the deals. \r\nWith regard to dispositions, we closed one in Refrigeration & Food Equipment and are currently working on another in Engineered Systems. These 2 businesses account for about $200 million in 2015 revenue. \r\nNow let's look at 2016. We are very encouraged with the actions taken this year that have set us up for 2016. Our 2015 restructuring activities provide us with meaningful benefits. The accretion from our recent acquisitions and carryover benefits from our share repurchase activities will also be of significant benefit in 2016. There will be offsets in the form of reset compensation levels and increased investment in the growth areas I'll discuss in a moment. \r\nLooking at the year ahead, we expect North American oil and gas markets to continue to be difficult. Our expectations are that the first half of 2016 will be sequentially below the second half of 2015, with improving trends into the second half of the year. We expect marking and coding, refrigeration and food equipment, retail fueling, plastics and polymers and U.S. industrial markets to be generally solid. We see significant growth in areas like digital printing and biopharma applications, and we expect China markets to be modest. \r\nLooking out across our segments, we see multiple opportunities to help mitigate tough markets. In fact, we see the potential for a full point of growth alone coming from new product releases and another 0.5 point being realized from our geographic-expansion activities. And of course, we will remain focused on acquisitions, and we'll be pursuing our prioritized roadmap of targets. \r\nHere, you can see our 2016 forecast, which includes growth rates by segment. And you'll note aside from Energy, in our upstream activity in North America, we expect growth in our businesses, partly driven by new product launches, many of which are already in the marketplace. We expect earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.85 to $4.05. While we expect markets to remain tough, I feel very good that our multiple proactive measures will help mitigate these challenging conditions. Let's look closer at some of these activities. \r\nIn Energy, we've significantly expanded our aftermarket capabilities and have also increased our international presence to drive growth in the Middle East, Latin America and Asia. We have also continued to serve the needs of our customers quite well and gain share in areas such as ESPs and automation. \r\nIn Engineered Systems, on the printing and ID side, we see an acceleration of the conversion to digital textile printing. We are also rolling out a new program at Markem-Imaje to improve the total cost of ownership of our products and services. On the industrial side of Engineered Systems, we will continue with new product introductions with a focus on productivity solutions for our customers in areas like waste handling and vehicle service and repair. \r\nIn Fluids, our Tokheim acquisition is now generating a lot of discussion with our customers. The dialogue is around our complete station-in-a-box capability and our significantly enhanced product portfolio. We are also launching new gear and screw pump technologies and are very encouraged with our level of new product introductions. We will also be increasing our sales and service resources in developing countries. \r\nIn our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, we will continue to capitalize on regulatory tailwinds and our customers' desire to save on energy cost. We look to expand our food retail leadership position in sectors such as drug, convenience and dollar stores. \r\nI touched earlier upon the actions we're taking to drive margin enhancements through our Dover excellence program. Let me share some history here. We began this initiative in 2009 with a supply chain effort aimed at consolidating spend and suppliers. This initiative has evolved into a broad-based program to include continuous improvement and, most recently, shared services. This program continues to receive significant attention and has clearly gained traction throughout the organization. \r\nA few highlights. Our supply chain is targeting over $40 million in cost savings in 2016. Additionally, within supply chain, we are focusing on cash flow yield and have implemented a pilot program around supplier payment terms that has already generated significant results. The second wave of this program is now underway. \r\nI am very excited with our continuous improvement initiative. It is now embedded across Dover. This enables us to enhance our value to the customer, as we are creating a organization of problem solvers and solution providers. We'll be expanding our shared services program in 2016. The focus of this initiative is improving efficiency and control, standardizing processes to eliminate waste and allowing us to focus on higher-value activities. \r\nOur approach to capital allocation in 2016 will be similar to past years, as our priorities remain consistent. We will continue our long-standing record of increasing our annual dividend. We will also continue to invest in our businesses and, once again, expect a modest CapEx budget with 60% of this budget focused on growth and productivity projects. As a minimum, we will keep our share count flat by covering dilution. And finally, my preference is on growing the company, and we have ample opportunities to enhance our strong positions in our growth markets through M&A. \r\nWe've covered a lot of ground in a relatively short amount of time, so let me share a few key takeaways. Our strategy remains consistent. At the root of our success is the fact that Dover is comprised of great businesses, and we continue to grow them and make them better. Our businesses are leaders in their markets, well positioned with customers with ample opportunities for growth. We continue to focus on organic growth and are continually enhancing our ability to become problem solvers and solution providers for our customers. We continue to engage in multiple productivity and cost-management activities to become leaner and more responsive while also expanding our margins. \r\nAs we have done again this year, we will continue to acquire businesses that enhance our capabilities and enable us to become a more important partner with our customers, and we'll continue to generate strong free cash flow while maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation. These factors will allow us to generate a respectable 10% EPS growth in 2016. \r\nNow with that, Paul, let's take some questions.",

This enables us to enhance our value to the customer, as we are creating a organization of problem solvers and solution providers. We'll be expanding our shared services program in 2016. The focus of this initiative is improving efficiency and control, standardizing processes to eliminate waste and allowing us to focus on higher-value activities. \r\nOur approach to capital allocation in 2016 will be similar to past years, as our priorities remain consistent. We will continue our long-standing record of increasing our annual dividend. We will also continue to invest in our businesses and, once again, expect a modest CapEx budget with 60% of this budget focused on growth and productivity projects. As a minimum, we will keep our share count flat by covering dilution. And finally, my preference is on growing the company, and we have ample opportunities to enhance our strong positions in our growth markets through M&A. \r\nWe've covered a lot of ground in a relatively short amount of time, so let me share a few key takeaways. Our strategy remains consistent. At the root of our success is the fact that Dover is comprised of great businesses, and we continue to grow them and make them better. Our businesses are leaders in their markets, well positioned with customers with ample opportunities for growth. We continue to focus on organic growth and are continually enhancing our ability to become problem solvers and solution providers for our customers. We continue to engage in multiple productivity and cost-management activities to become leaner and more responsive while also expanding our margins. \r\nAs we have done again this year, we will continue to acquire businesses that enhance our capabilities and enable us to become a more important partner with our customers, and we'll continue to generate strong free cash flow while maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation. These factors will allow us to generate a respectable 10% EPS growth in 2016. \r\nNow with that, Paul, let's take some questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Thanks, Bob. Like we do on an earnings call, we would like to limit everybody to one question. And then if we have extra time -- we're going to go about 20, 25 minutes; if we have extra time, people that have asked a question can ask another question. We'll go back and forth. Adrian [ph]? Steve?\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions, one on... Oh, it was one. All right. Then I'll go for this one in that case. So if I sort of reflect back on guidance, starting last December...\n\n---\n\nOh, gosh, do I have to?\n\n---\n\nAnd the progression through the year, even to tonight...\n\n---\n\nEven through this afternoon at 4:15.\n\n---\n\nRight. And so when we think about kind of the lessons that we should take away as investors when we listen to the guidance for 2016, what is it that has changed in your process, given the state of the world and how quickly things are deteriorating in such a way that allows you to have a higher level of confidence and by turn, us having a higher level of confidence in the numbers that you're putting in front of us tonight?\n\n---\n\nSo are you really asking me that I learned anything in 2015 with respect to the energy market?\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nOkay. Actually, it's -- this is a very serious question because it has generated a lot of dialogue inside Dover during the past year. I will speak both from a corporate perspective as well as from, I think, representing the segment guys as well. The downturn in the energy market a year ago -- for us, we had no idea it was going to be as steep and as sharp and as low as it turned out to be. If I had known a year ago what I'd known today, the guidance would have been different a year ago. That I can guarantee you. Now have we become smarter or what have we changed over the past year, I can attest for Soma and the business teams -- not just the segment team, but Soma and the business teams -- have become so much more granular in their, what I call, in their data analytics and understanding the individual customers. Not only their product and technology requirements, but I think we have a much, much closer connection with the customer today and even understanding what some of their spending decisions not only have been but that they're considering here over the short term. It has been a year of learning. I think the other area that, perhaps, has been a bit of a learning -- maybe not as extensive or as large as Energy, but I think we've seen some changes in China this past year that, though we did not enter 2015 with the same expectations of growth that we had -- that we enjoyed in '14 and '13, the downturn or the softness that we experienced in the second half of '15 was truly not anticipated, even as far back as the end of the first quarter, let alone a year ago. I think in both of these areas, we're taking a much more cautious approach in our guidance for 2016. And at year-end this time next year, you'll be invited to ask the same question, and I hope our progress and our delivery is much different in '16 than it was in '15.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Next question. Steve?\n\n---\n\nThe Energy margin assumption in '16?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Is that a question? Do you want to know what it is?\n\n---\n\nIt's a comment, and then I have a follow-up question.\n\n---\n\nIt's a comment. Okay. Okay. All right. \r\nSo I -- well, I could answer this about 3 different ways. Let's say all costs in, we have some additional restructuring that's embedded in our plan for 2016. We're also benefiting from some of the benefits of the restructuring activities that occurred in '15 that are carried over. But I -- help me here, Soma. I think our plan and our guidance at the top end of our range, Steve, at the top end of the range, I think we have margins baked into the plan at about 14.5%. Am I close?\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nOkay.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just on capital deployment...\n\n---\n\nThat's 2 questions.\n\n---\n\nHow much -- that was a comment that you interpreted. On capital deployment, what is the -- what's the number that you have in mind as far as discretionary potential capital deployment? And then how do you evaluate buybacks versus acquisitions? Because obviously, you do more if there are good acquisitions out there. How do we think about kind of the potential for buybacks for the next 12 months?\n\n---\n\nWell, I stated unequivocally here in my prepared comments that my preference is to grow the company, and we'll continue to look to pursue some of the acquisitions that we believe will be in front of us in 2016. I can guarantee you that we'll remain as disciplined on our valuation and pricing as we have been over the last 3 or 4 years. And we have no hesitation walking away from a deal when the price is not right, and I think we have shown that over the last 3 or 4 years. If you're talking about size of capital allocation. Without any additional debt, you can label cash flow and cash on hand at easily being $800 million available for acquisitions. And again, that's before debt. Is there an opportunity or would we increase our debt leverage if we found our sales in front of the right deals at the right valuation? The answer is yes. And if we feel the valuations on acquisitions are beginning to move out in front of us in an area we don't want to go and our stock is, at that particular time, undervalued in our perspective near term, we will -- we will, we have done, and we will reconsider share repurchase again. But that's not any different than what we've been doing for the last 3 or 4 years.\n\n---\n\nCan you step in over here?\n\n---\n\nSo Bob, you're guiding to a solid U.S. industrial market in '16.\n\n---\n\nI think -- I had a word -- I said generally solid.\n\n---\n\nRight. So what's solid and what's not, if it's generally solid?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So I think if you look at -- where's Andy? If you look at Andy's businesses in the industrial space, yes, we feel pretty good with our businesses in that space and think we'll continue to see market expansion and growth opportunities in those markets that we serve. We do -- within Fluids, we do continue to see some challenges in the North American market with respect to some of the products that are really prevalent in oil and gas, and we continue to see quite positive markets in the U.S. for Markem-Imaje in the consumer space. And I highlighted that as one of the areas for further investment for Markem-Imaje, our sales and service investment that we're looking to make even in the U.S. in 2016. But in general, aside from the energy patch, we continue to see generally solid market conditions in the U.S.\n\n---\n\nI guess, you reduced your fourth quarter guidance in part because of incremental restructuring, yet your 2016 guidance has an assumption baked in that restructuring is going to be lower year-over-year. How comfortable are you with that assumption? And sort of what's embedded in that?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So 2016, even in addition to the incremental restructuring we're doing here in the fourth quarter, I think we have $20 million or $25 million of spend in the 2016 plan and guidance for restructuring. That's spend. That's -- if you treat 2015 as a high watermark because of the downturn in energy, that $20 million to $25 million is on par, perhaps a bit higher, than you would've seen us in our normal years, let's say, '12, '13 and '14. I think those years probably averaged something in the $15 million to $20 million range. So it's not a lot different.\n\n---\n\nAny questions? Nigel?\n\n---\n\nBob, my first comment is...\n\n---\n\nDo I have to a respond to a comment now? I've learned the lesson from Steve.\n\n---\n\nPricing, what do you see in pricing? Because I think the big concern is -- I think it is kind of like grinding in the macro; why would the pricing deteriorate? Maybe just comment on Energy business as well, and the portfolio next year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So we came in to -- now I'm going to revert back to some guidance that we gave a year ago. We came into 2015 and I think on our January call, we did highlight then that we expected some pricing pressure in Energy, that we felt like it would -- for the segment, it would be limited to the 3% to 5% range. Nigel, I will tell you that for the segment will probably going to end the year on the low end of that range is -- which is what we've been commenting on all year long. We do see price pressure in product areas within Energy that are greater than the 3% range. I've been commenting on that all year long. In our rods business, it's been 10% or 11%. In our inserts business for the drilling bit activity, it's probably been 5% or 6%. So let me rephrase 2015 as being 3% for Energy. Next year, we expect it to be a strong 1%, a little bit better than 1% but less than 2%. And we feel pretty comfortable with that, and we expect it to occur in the same areas that we've seen in 2015. For the other parts of the business, we may see it a little bit here in a product area or this product area. But when you look at it at the segment level, it's immaterial for the other 3 segments, not even measurable.\n\n---\n\nAndrew? Right in front here.\n\n---\n\nJust a question about planning process.\n\n---\n\nAbout planning process?\n\n---\n\nGiven that oil is all over the place, how do you sort of -- when did you finish your planning process and...\n\n---\n\nI would love to say that oil has been all over the place. But actually, it's been on a downward bias.\n\n---\n\nWell -- so how do you frame the risk? Is oil remaining where it is within your current forecast? And what happens to your forecast if oil remains where it is?\n\n---\n\nIf oil price in 2016 were to average what it is right now, let's call it mid-30s -- let me round up a little bit, mid-30s, the Energy forecast top line would be a bit at risk. I think maybe the answer to your question would be to share with you what's embedded in our guidance around assumptions in Energy. We do expect drilling activity to be down 22% to 25% in 2016. You'll see some forecasters that have a lower number. You'll see some forecasters that, perhaps, even have a number as high as 27%. Our number is 22% to 25%, and we have a price of oil embedded in our forecast, in our planning for 2016, of $45 average for the year.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\nIt is average to average, yes. Both numbers are year-over-year averages, not sequential.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Let's -- in the middle there.\n\n---\n\nYes. Bob, you commented on China weakening further in the fourth quarter. Maybe you can expand on that. And how has activity in China changed your planning process and positioning in China for 2016?\n\n---\n\nYes. So let me clarify your comment. No, there was -- embedded in that was the first part of the comment that activity in China in the fourth quarter is down further. I'm not so sure we're going to see that relative to the third quarter. We surely haven't seen -- we actually thought we would see a bit of a pickup in October and November in China because we saw it in September versus August and July. And the -- in some parts of the business, we did see a bit of a pickup. Areas related to construction, residential construction, industrial construction that would impact or benefit our SWEP business, that business has not come back and it has been even weaker in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. The areas of our portfolio around the segments -- around the 4 segments that -- I use the phrase sort of touch, connect and serve the consumer base in China has actually held up fairly well. This would be examples like our auto lift business, some parts of the retail fueling business, the consumer parts, especially packaged goods around Markem-Imaje and I'm probably missing an area. But it -- we'll see when we close the year, but I don't think the organic growth -- the negative organic growth in China in the fourth quarter will be as steep as it was in the third quarter, but it's still down. And we're taking the second half of the year. The real question was about our planning for '16. We actually look at the second half of '15 and use that as a baseline for '16, with some businesses really being up a little bit based upon product introductions and new adjacencies and some businesses being down. But overall, it will not surprise me at all if China is actually weaker year-over-year for the full year in 2016 than it was in 2015.\n\n---\n\nBob, you've been through a couple of -- you've been through prior recessions and this economy...\n\n---\n\nYes, I remember a couple of them.\n\n---\n\nThis economy has been sort of a tale of 2 economies, right? Consumer strength obviously and energy disaster and then industrial getting worse. Can you just maybe give us a perspective with respect to how you think of Dover's position today versus those prior periods? And quite legitimately, I mean, you're not an economist. Things could -- they're getting worse. If they continue to get worse, what's your contingency plan? And you -- maybe you could draw from sort of the lessons you've learned and say how you restructured Soma's business, for example, in the past year. And just again, like your -- it's almost kind of a -- how you're going to manage this process. If the more bullish scenario doesn't play out and it actually does get worse, how are we -- how are you thinking about that?\n\n---\n\nSo John, let me remind you that in our planning and our guidance for 2016, aside from the upstream Energy business here in North America, for the most part we're actually predicting growth, albeit modest but we're actually predicting growth in the other 3 segments, in the other part of Energy. And I'm sure there may be -- there may -- I don't want to say at every company because as sure as I say that, someone's going to whisper to me later, \"Well, so and so is down next year.\" But for the general part, our companies are expecting low to modest growth in 2016. Let me explain to you what is in the guidance, and I commented on this twice in my prepared comments. We are making significant investments around Dover in 2016. They all don't come online January 1. I think, and we forget -- well, I won't  say forget because it's a significant number, but we've got a reset in compensation. I don't remember what that number is. Brad, if you know it offhand, you can quote it. But it's highlighted on our guidance chart. You had a number on the guidance chart of both -- we said compensation and growth investment. It's about half and half. The compensation reset is about half that number, and growth investment is the other half. I will tell you that if we were to enter recession in 2016, it's difficult. As the CEO, I'm telling you. It's difficult to believe that we're going to reset compensation. We'll have -- we're going to have to get through another tough year, and the scrutiny and the discussions we have internally around Dover on those investments become a lot tighter. So we have -- what is the number in here? Rough number, $65 million. Am I my close, Brad?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay, $65 million for reset of compensation and growth investments. And depending upon the economy, you have to treat those as discretionary, and we will.\n\n---\n\nOkay, Jeff?\n\n---\n\nBob, can you elaborate a little bit more on -- underneath the surface on the Energy forecast? So when you say drilling down 22 to 25, right, you could get there on just annualizing the rig counts. So it kind of sounds like that's what you did. But what about the rest of the business? I just actually heard you say a part of Energy might be up. So can you just walk us through what you're expecting for artificial lift, automation, how you build the stuff for that forecast?\n\n---\n\nYes. So I think the -- I'm not sure I can be precise with my answer, Jeff. I do believe that for 2016, our artificial lift business for the year is pretty much on the run rate of what we've experienced in the second half of the year. Soma, am I close on that comment? Okay. Within automation, I would say the same thing, that we're expecting business activity for the year to be pretty darn close to what we've experienced in the second half. A significant part of the year-over-year decline is the fact that we truly did not see that much of a decline in our Energy revenue in the first quarter of '15. Now in drilling -- our drilling activity, that one business will -- we do anticipate to see further revenue pressure on that part of the business in 2016. And I believe even with the strength ahead in the first quarter of '15, I'm not even sure we have it as a run rate in the second -- in 2016 equal to the second half of the '15 run rate. And that's where we do see some pressure throughout the year. Does that help?\n\n---\n\nSo I think we have the same question, dinner. So I think we'll do one last question, and then people will stay around after dinner.\n\n---\n\nYes, the Dover team will stay around for 30 minutes after dinner for any buyer that wishes to corner Soma or Andy or Bill or Bill or Brad. I'm gone. Okay?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So let's do Julian for the end. And anybody I didn't get, I apologize. More questions in time.\n\n---\n\nWell, maybe just a question around Fluids. I think there's always issues or concerns around the exact Energy exposure in that business, so maybe talk about the exposure.\n\n---\n\nSo -- yes, so let's see. For the segment -- let me give you some segment numbers. For the segment, our -- we feel our upstream exposure is about 10% to 12% of 2015's revenue. I think we've -- Julian, I think we've actually been sharing that same number since the end of June or since the July call, and it's good. That's a good number. Here's where -- if -- where we do see it spill over a little bit into other parts of Fluids is that there are some companies -- there are some customers who have investment profile both in upstream as well as in mid- or downstream parts of their business. And as they have been forced to cut their CapEx budget, we've seen some of them cutting their CapEx budget and allocation of capital even in the midstream and downstream parts of the business. But from a pure perspective of upstream oil and gas activity, it's about 10% to 12% in the segment.\n\n---\n\nAnd any color on margin?\n\n---\n\nAnd I will tell you the bulk of it is in pumps. It's not across the segment. The bulk of it -- not all of it, but the bulk of it is in pumps.\n\n---\n\nAnd how about margins next year? Including acquisition impact and so on, how much should they change in '16?\n\n---\n\nIs that a Fluids question or -- oh, gosh, I think Brad or Bill, you're going to have to correct me if I give a wrong answer here. But I think all in, including acquisition -- the effective acquisitions, I think our margins will be down roughly 250 basis points from 2015. And I think we're going to end 2015 north of 19 but less than 20. Am I accurate enough, Brad? Okay. \r\nAll right. So this is -- we're bringing this to a conclusion, and the Dover team will hang around for another 30 minutes. We'll be glad to have a cocktail with you and answer a question or 2.\n\n---\n\n30 minutes after dinner.\n\n---\n\n30 minutes after dinner, yes. Now we're going to have dinner. Thank you. Okay. All right. Thank you very much.",

I've learned the lesson from Steve.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nigel Coe (Analysts)】\nPricing, what do you see in pricing? Because I think the big concern is -- I think it is kind of like grinding in the macro; why would the pricing deteriorate? Maybe just comment on Energy business as well, and the portfolio next year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Livingston (Executives)】\nOkay. So we came in to -- now I'm going to revert back to some guidance that we gave a year ago. We came into 2015 and I think on our January call, we did highlight then that we expected some pricing pressure in Energy, that we felt like it would -- for the segment, it would be limited to the 3% to 5% range. Nigel, I will tell you that for the segment will probably going to end the year on the low end of that range is -- which is what we've been commenting on all year long. We do see price pressure in product areas within Energy that are greater than the 3% range. I've been commenting on that all year long. In our rods business, it's been 10% or 11%. In our inserts business for the drilling bit activity, it's probably been 5% or 6%. So let me rephrase 2015 as being 3% for Energy. Next year, we expect it to be a strong 1%, a little bit better than 1% but less than 2%. And we feel pretty comfortable with that, and we expect it to occur in the same areas that we've seen in 2015. For the other parts of the business, we may see it a little bit here in a product area or this product area. But when you look at it at the segment level, it's immaterial for the other 3 segments, not even measurable.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Goldberg (Executives)】\nAndrew? Right in front here.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Obin (Analysts)】\nJust a question about planning process.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Livingston (Executives)】\nAbout planning process?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Obin (Analysts)】\nGiven that oil is all over the place, how do you sort of -- when did you finish your planning process and...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Livingston (Executives)】\nI would love to say that oil has been all over the place. But actually, it's been on a downward bias.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Obin (Analysts)】\nWell -- so how do you frame the risk? Is oil remaining where it is within your current forecast? And what happens to your forecast if oil remains where it is?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Livingston (Executives)】\nIf oil price in 2016 were to average what it is right now, let's call it mid-30s -- let me round up a little bit, mid-30s, the Energy forecast top line would be a bit at risk. I think maybe the answer to your question would be to share with you what's embedded in our guidance around assumptions in Energy. We do expect drilling activity to be down 22% to 25% in 2016. You'll see some forecasters that have a lower number. You'll see some forecasters that, perhaps, even have a number as high as 27%. Our number is 22% to 25%, and we have a price of oil embedded in our forecast, in our planning for 2016, of $45 average for the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Obin (Analysts)】\n[indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Livingston (Executives)】\nIt is average to average, yes. Both numbers are year-over-year averages, not sequential.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Goldberg (Executives)】\nGreat. Let's -- in the middle there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Inch (Analysts)】\nYes. Bob, you commented on China weakening further in the fourth quarter. Maybe you can expand on that. And how has activity in China changed your planning process and positioning in China for 2016?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Livingston (Executives)】\nYes. So let me clarify your comment. No, there was -- embedded in that was the first part of the comment that activity in China in the fourth quarter is down further. I'm not so sure we're going to see that relative to the third quarter. We surely haven't seen -- we actually thought we would see a bit of a pickup in October and November in China because we saw it in September versus August and July. And the -- in some parts of the business, we did see a bit of a pickup. Areas related to construction, residential construction, industrial construction that would impact or benefit our SWEP business, that business has not come back and it has been even weaker in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. The areas of our portfolio around the segments -- around the 4 segments that -- I use the phrase sort of touch, connect and serve the consumer base in China has actually held up fairly well. This would be examples like our auto lift business, some parts of the retail fueling business, the consumer parts, especially packaged goods around Markem-Imaje and I'm probably missing an area. But it -- we'll see when we close the year, but I don't think the organic growth -- the negative organic growth in China in the fourth quarter will be as steep as it was in the third quarter, but it's still down. And we're taking the second half of the year. The real question was about our planning for '16. We actually look at the second half of '15 and use that as a baseline for '16, with some businesses really being up a little bit based upon product introductions and new adjacencies and some businesses being down. But overall, it will not surprise me at all if China is actually weaker year-over-year for the full year in 2016 than it was in 2015.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Inch (Analysts)】\nBob, you've been through a couple of -- you've been through prior recessions and this economy...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Livingston (Executives)】\nYes, I remember a couple of them.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Inch (Analysts)】\nThis economy has been sort of a tale of 2 economies, right? Consumer strength obviously and energy disaster and then industrial getting worse. Can you just maybe give us a perspective with respect to how you think of Dover's position today versus those prior periods? And quite legitimately, I mean, you're not an economist. Things could -- they're getting worse. If they continue to get worse, what's your contingency plan? And you -- maybe you could draw from sort of the lessons you've learned and say how you restructured Soma's business, for example, in the past year. And just again, like your -- it's almost kind of a -- how you're going to manage this process. If the more bullish scenario doesn't play out and it actually does get worse, how are we -- how are you thinking about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Livingston (Executives)】\nSo John, let me remind you that in our planning and our guidance for 2016, aside from the upstream Energy business here in North America, for the most part we're actually predicting growth, albeit modest but we're actually predicting growth in the other 3 segments, in the other part of Energy. And I'm sure there may be -- there may -- I don't want to say at every company because as sure as I say that, someone's going to whisper to me later, \"Well, so and so is down next year.\" But for the general part, our companies are expecting low to modest growth in 2016. Let me explain to you what is in the guidance, and I commented on this twice in my prepared comments. We are making significant investments around Dover in 2016. They all don't come online January 1. I think, and we forget -- well, I won't  say forget because it's a significant number, but we've got a reset in compensation. I don't remember what that number is. Brad, if you know it offhand, you can quote it. But it's highlighted on our guidance chart. You had a number on the guidance chart of both -- we said compensation and growth investment. It's about half and half. The compensation reset is about half that number, and growth investment is the other half. I will tell you that if we were to enter recession in 2016, it's difficult. As the CEO, I'm telling you. It's difficult to believe that we're going to reset compensation. We'll have -- we're going to have to get through another tough year, and the scrutiny and the discussions we have internally around Dover on those investments become a lot tighter. So we have -- what is the number in here? Rough number, $65 million. Am I my close, Brad?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brad Cerepak (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Livingston (Executives)】\nOkay, $65 million for reset of compensation and growth investments. And depending upon the economy, you have to treat those as discretionary, and we will.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Goldberg (Executives)】\nOkay, Jeff?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Sprague (Analysts)】\nBob, can you elaborate a little bit more on -- underneath the surface on the Energy forecast? So when you say drilling down 22 to 25, right, you could get there on just annualizing the rig counts. So it kind of sounds like that's what you did. But what about the rest of the business? I just actually heard you say a part of Energy might be up. So can you just walk us through what you're expecting for artificial lift, automation, how you build the stuff for that forecast?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Livingston (Executives)】\nYes. So I think the -- I'm not sure I can be precise with my answer, Jeff. I do believe that for 2016, our artificial lift business for the year is pretty much on the run rate of what we've experienced in the second half of the year. Soma, am I close on that comment? Okay. Within automation, I would say the same thing, that we're expecting business activity for the year to be pretty darn close to what we've experienced in the second half. A significant part of the year-over-year decline is the fact that we truly did not see that much of a decline in our Energy revenue in the first quarter of '15. Now in drilling -- our drilling activity, that one business will -- we do anticipate to see further revenue pressure on that part of the business in 2016. And I believe even with the strength ahead in the first quarter of '15, I'm not even sure we have it as a run rate in the second -- in 2016 equal to the second half of the '15 run rate. And that's where we do see some pressure throughout the year. Does that help?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Goldberg (Executives)】\nSo I think we have the same question, dinner. So I think we'll do one last question, and then people will stay around after dinner.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Livingston (Executives)】\nYes, the Dover team will stay around for 30 minutes after dinner for any buyer that wishes to corner Soma or Andy or Bill or Bill or Brad. I'm gone. Okay?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Goldberg (Executives)】\nOkay. So let's do Julian for the end. And anybody I didn't get, I apologize. More questions in time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Julian Mitchell (Analysts)】\nWell, maybe just a question around Fluids. I think there's always issues or concerns around the exact Energy exposure in that business, so maybe talk about the exposure.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Livingston (Executives)】\nSo -- yes, so let's see. For the segment -- let me give you some segment numbers. For the segment, our -- we feel our upstream exposure is about 10% to 12% of 2015's revenue. I think we've -- Julian, I think we've actually been sharing that same number since the end of June or since the July call, and it's good. That's a good number. Here's where -- if -- where we do see it spill over a little bit into other parts of Fluids is that there are some companies -- there are some customers who have investment profile both in upstream as well as in mid- or downstream parts of their business. And as they have been forced to cut their CapEx budget, we've seen some of them cutting their CapEx budget and allocation of capital even in the midstream and downstream parts of the business. But from a pure perspective of upstream oil and gas activity, it's about 10% to 12% in the segment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Julian Mitchell (Analysts)】\nAnd any color on margin?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Livingston (Executives)】\nAnd I will tell you the bulk of it is in pumps. It's not across the segment. The bulk of it -- not all of it, but the bulk of it is in pumps.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Julian Mitchell (Analysts)】\nAnd how about margins next year? Including acquisition impact and so on, how much should they change in '16?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Livingston (Executives)】\nIs that a Fluids question or -- oh, gosh, I think Brad or Bill, you're going to have to correct me if I give a wrong answer here. But I think all in, including acquisition -- the effective acquisitions, I think our margins will be down roughly 250 basis points from 2015. And I think we're going to end 2015 north of 19 but less than 20. Am I accurate enough, Brad? Okay. \r\nAll right. So this is -- we're bringing this to a conclusion, and the Dover team will hang around for another 30 minutes. We'll be glad to have a cocktail with you and answer a question or 2.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Goldberg (Executives)】\n30 minutes after dinner.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Livingston (Executives)】\n30 minutes after dinner, yes. Now we're going to have dinner. Thank you. Okay. All right. Thank you very much.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Elise. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Red Hat's earnings call for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Speakers for today's call will be Jim Whitehurst, President and CEO; and Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President of Operations and CFO. \r\nOur earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from redhat.com on the Investor Relations page. Also on this page, you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks, a schedule of currency rates and a slide deck of financial highlights and supplemental metrics that include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. \r\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements about our future financial performance and other events and trends, including guidance for our fourth fiscal quarter and our full fiscal year. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results and the performance of our business, and which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including today's press release and the risk factors and other information contained in our most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Red Hat assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements we may make on today's call. \r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Jim.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to announce that we delivered another strong quarter, with both revenue and profitability exceeding our guidance for Q3. Even more importantly, looking forward, we continued to strengthen our leadership position in the emerging open hybrid cloud sector. \r\nRed Hat associates are executing at a high level across the company as we further increase our strategic importance with customers. We believe that Red Hat is highly differentiated in our ability to help organizations transform their IT to be more agile and improve their customers' experiences. \r\nThis led to the Q3 results that demonstrated solid growth across all major geographies, consistently high revenue growth in both our infrastructure, as well as our application development and emerging technologies product groups. And we experienced large deal wins, cross-selling and strong renewals within our top deals.  The strength of our results are evidence of the strong demand for technologies that address the modernization of IT and customers' desire to work in an open hybrid cloud world. Red Hat continues to grow by better enabling our customers to build, deploy and manage their applications across multiple environments and infrastructures. \r\nWith that overview, let me discuss a few of our recent technology, marketing and partnership highlights. First, as a premier sponsor of the OpenStack Summit in Tokyo, we took the opportunity to highlight our enterprise customers' success stories across a variety of verticals including telecommunications, education and banking. At the conference, we also jointly demonstrated our NFV offerings for OpenStack with the service provider panel that included Verizon, China Mobile and Telus. In addition, we announced an expanded relationship with Lenovo to provide Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack platform with Lenovo hardware to bring more secure, reliable and flexible platforms to enterprise IT looking to build hybrid cloud deployments. \r\nSecond, we enhanced our management capabilities with the acquisition of Ansible, an open source IT automation software company launched in 2013. We chose Ansible because it is aligned with the core principles that shape Red Hat's management strategy in the following ways:\r\nAnsible is simple to use since it's agentless. Its playbooks make it easier to both write and maintain automation workflows. The team has built a highly popular open source project with a strong community. Ansible technologies support heterogeneous IT environments including Linux, Microsoft, AWS and the Google Cloud. And they expand our capabilities to offer application management across the 4 footprints of physical, virtual, private cloud and public cloud. \r\nThe integration of Ansible is well underway, and we're hearing strong interest from customers. And there is great internal excitement for the additional value they bring to our technology stack. In fact, the Ansible team had great momentum and closed several new wins, including their largest deal to date, a 6-figure deal with a global transportation technology provider. As part of our management portfolio, Ansible's role in dev ops and automation will be an important component of how Red Hat helps customers modernize their IT applications in the world of continuous deployment. \r\n \r\nThird, we launched a strategic partnership with Microsoft that was really a milestone event for the industry. Both Microsoft and Red Hat share the same view that it will be a hybrid cloud world, and we are working together to enable customers to realize the benefits of this transformation of IT. Let me describe and provide an update on some of the key elements of the partnership. \r\nRHEL is the preferred choice for enterprise Linux workflows on Azure and is now available for customers, representing the first deliverable of the partnership. We've already established customer -- have already enabled customers to take full advantage of their Red Hat subscriptions at Azure through the Red Hat Cloud Access program, where customers are able to bring their own subscriptions to run in Azure and be fully supported by both Red Hat and Microsoft. Customers will now be able to build and deploy applications in Azure using subscriptions of RHEL, JBoss EAP, JBoss Web Server, Red Hat Gluster Storage and OpenStack -- sorry, OpenShift PaaS.\r\nIn the coming months, Red Hat technologies on demand will also be available in Azure. These pay-as-you-go RHEL images will be available in the Azure marketplace and supported by Red Hat. Customers will be offered cross-platform, cross-company support spanning the Microsoft and Red Hat offerings in an integrated way, unlike any of our previous partnerships in the public cloud. We have already begun the co-locating support teams at Azure premises with the goal of making the customer experience simple and seamless at cloud speed. \r\nIn addition, being able to manage workloads across a variety of environments and infrastructures will be an important capability for customers in the hybrid cloud world. The management solution to do this will be our CloudForms technology. This month, we launched CloudForms 4.0, which gives customers the ability to manage RHEL on both Hyper-V and Azure. \r\nWe're also collaborating on .NET for our new generation of application development capabilities. The plan is it enable developers to access .NET technologies across Red Hat offerings, including OpenShift and RHEL, jointly backed by Microsoft and Red Hat. RHEL will be the primary Microsoft development and reference operating system for .NET Core on Linux. This is an exciting partnership for our joint customers, and I look forward to updating you on our progress. \r\nIn summary, I am pleased with our execution and results so far this year. I'm looking forward to a strong finish to the fiscal year, where we expect to achieve the $2 billion revenue milestone. Beyond this year, we have a compelling opportunity in front of us and exciting work to do to achieve our potential in the open hybrid cloud. \r\nIn closing, I want to thank Red Hat associates around the globe for their hard work. Red Hat's associates have created an exciting, enviable place to make a difference. In fact, Red Hat was recently recognized among the top 50 Best Places to Work in Glassdoor's 2016 survey. Red Hat has been built by a truly passionate and talented team, and I'm honored to be a part of it. \r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Frank.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Jim. We executed well with another strong quarter, which resulted in our ability to exceed our guidance across a number of metrics. We continue to see our investments in emerging technologies, expanded partnerships in high-caliber sales teams contributing to the high growth. This marked our fourth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus total revenue growth on a constant-currency basis. \r\nLet me first start with my remarks with the financial highlights of our Q3 performance and then update our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. For a more detailed view of our results and metrics, please refer to our press release, supplemental metrics and a copy of our prepared remarks that are available in the Investor Relations section of redhat.com. \r\nHere are the Q3 financial highlights. We were pleased to see total revenue of $524 million, which grew 21% on a year-over-year basis in constant currency or 15% in U.S. dollars. Taking into account the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, total revenue would have been $28 million or 630 basis points higher using the rates from Q3 of last year. Due to the continued high FX volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant-currency results for the quarter using the rates from Q3 last year where it's appropriate. \r\nOur revenue performance for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance by approximately $1 million on a U.S. dollar basis and approximately $4 million when using the exchange rates we provided in our guidance in September. Our better-than-expected revenue performance this quarter resulted from continued strong demand that Jim just referenced, as well as execution across our organization. The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue of $457 million, an increase of 22% in constant currency and 16% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. This renewable revenue stream now constitutes 87% of total revenue, which provides us with a high level of revenue visibility in addition to future growth opportunities as we renew and expand our customer relationships. \r\nBreaking out the subscription revenue by technology, we are very pleased to see the subscription revenue for the Infrastructure-related offerings was $373 million, an increase of 18% in constant currency and 12% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. And particular to note, our subscription revenue for application development-related and emerging technologies offerings was $84 million, an increase of 45% in constant currency and 37% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Application development-related and emerging technologies revenue was approximately 60% of total revenue, and this is up from 14% of total revenue in the year-ago quarter. \r\nOn a non-GAAP basis, operating income grew 13%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 23.5%. This non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 60 basis points above our guidance, which as a reminder included the expenses related to the Ansible acquisition. The 60 basis points of margin upside was due in part to the stronger revenue growth. \r\nWith investments in our growth initiatives, we added approximately 400 associates this quarter, including approximately 50 associates related to the acquisition of Ansible. As we build our talent base of key skill sets, we have added approximately 950 associates through Q3 and we are on track to add more than 1,250 associates for the full fiscal year. \r\nUsing our estimated annual effective tax rate of 29%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.48, $0.02 above the guidance we provided after the Ansible acquisition. Higher revenue and disciplined spending were the main drivers of the EPS upside. \r\nWe ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $1.87 billion. We returned $78 million to shareholders from repurchasing approximately 987,000 shares of stock. And we had approximately $352 million remaining on the current share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter. \r\nTotal deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.49 billion, an increase of $187 million or 14% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant-currency basis, total deferred revenue would have been up 20%. The total change in deferred revenue from our cash flow statement that neutralizes most of the impact of currency fluctuations was an increase of $97 million. \r\nOperating cash flow of $140 million for the quarter was up 5% year-over-year. The timing of customer collections and cash disbursements can affect the growth rate on a single quarter basis. The year-to-date operating cash flow was up 16%. \r\nOur rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the billings proxy was $559 million, up 15% year-over-year. On a constant-currency basis, this metric would have been 21%. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus year-over-year growth, demonstrating our consistent growth in the business. This metric also reflects both the higher bookings duration in Q3 of last year of 24 months and the 22-month average duration we have experienced in Q3 of this fiscal year. As we look ahead, we would expect the bookings duration for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to be closer to the historic 21-month level compared to the 22 months in Q4 a year ago. \r\nI will now review the metrics for business momentum and the large deals in the quarter. Across all geographies, we saw continued growth in our bookings despite FX headwinds. This quarter, 60% of the bookings came from the Americas, 26% from EMEA and 14% from Asia-Pacific versus a 62%-25%-13% split in Q3 of last year. \r\nThe Q3 sales route to market mix was 67% from the channel and 33% from our direct sales force compared to a 70%-30% split in Q3 of last year. Consistent with Q3 seasonality, we closed a number of large direct deals and continue to target an annual goal of a 70%-30% split. \r\nWithin our top largest -- 30 top largest deals, all of them were approximately $1 million or more. Within that, we had 11 deals that were in excess of $5 million. And of these deals, 3 were over $10 million. \r\nCross-selling was strong, with 70% of the deals including one or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings. We expect the growing adoption of these technologies like Middleware, the RHEL OpenStack platform, OpenShift, cloud management and storage to continue to drive revenue growth.  \r\nThe top vertical for the quarter was financial followed closely by mainstream customers in sectors such as health care, transportation and retail. \r\nOn our renewal business, we once again renewed all of the top 25 deals that we were expecting. The total subscription value of these 25 renewals was approximately 120% of the prior value. \r\n \r\nJim discussed Red Hat's increasing strategic importance with customers. This quarter, we had a great example of this with the third largest deal of the quarter, a global financial services customer that renewed in excess of $10 million. First, let me give you some background. This global financial services customer was an early adopter of Linux and ran a mixed Linux environment. Around 2007, the customer decided on a Linux vendor offering free multiyear support on their Linux distribution. \r\nThe account team did not give up on this customer, and by fiscal year 2013, the customer decided to standardize on RHEL, and we closed a multiyear deal for approximately $2 million. Through exemplary account management, we renewed this customer this quarter to a significant 3-year commitment in excess of $10 million. We have not only expanded the footprint of RHEL, but we are also helping this customer realize the benefits of private cloud computing, software-defined storage and containers. This customer is now buying RHEL, CloudForms, Red Hat Storage, OpenShift and OpenStack. So I want to just say congratulations to the account team for an exceptional job of focusing on the needs of the customer. \r\nI would like now to turn to our guidance. Our outlook assumes similar business conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as of December 17, 2015, which included a dollar to euro of $1.09 and a yen to dollar of JPY 123. Foreign exchange rates remain very volatile and may change from the rates we are using today. Our guidance also reaffirms our Q4 outlook for the Ansible acquisition, which we closed in October. \r\nI'm pleased to announce that despite the impact of weaker foreign exchange rates, we are raising our full year revenue guidance to $2.044 billion to $2.048 billion, up approximately 15% in U.S. dollars or approximately 20% in constant currency at the high end of the range. The annual revenue guidance is up approximately $12 million in constant currency from the high end of range of our September guidance. \r\nWe are modestly increasing operating margin to approximately 23.5%, and we're improving the cash flow by tightening the range from $695 million to $705 million. \r\nWe are also increasing our target of full year non-GAAP earnings per share to approximately $1.86 per share, assuming a 29% annual effective tax rate and a $1 million per quarter forecast for other income. This EPS is approximately $0.03 higher than the midpoint of the guidance we provided after the Ansible acquisition. \r\nFor Q4 specifically, this implies the following outlook:  We expect revenue to be in the range of $535 million to $539 million, which is up 16% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range, or up approximately 20% in constant currency. This is an increase of $10 million from our previous implied fourth quarter guidance on a constant-currency basis. \r\nWe expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22.5%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of the $0.47. Both of these estimates include the previous guidance on the impact of Ansible in Q4, which equates to approximately $0.02 a share. \r\nConsistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow even though there is an implied range in the full year outlook. \r\nOverall, we are very pleased with our financial performance in the third quarter. We are excited about the strategic leadership position for both open source and hybrid cloud computing as we are confident in the long term to continue to grow our market share. Given our higher outlook for revenue, non-GAAP operating margin and EPS, we look forward to a strong finish to the fiscal year. \r\nOperator, I would now like to turn it back to you for the first question.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nThank you, Elise. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Red Hat's earnings call for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Speakers for today's call will be Jim Whitehurst, President and CEO; and Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President of Operations and CFO. \r\nOur earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from redhat.com on the Investor Relations page. Also on this page, you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks, a schedule of currency rates and a slide deck of financial highlights and supplemental metrics that include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. \r\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements about our future financial performance and other events and trends, including guidance for our fourth fiscal quarter and our full fiscal year. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results and the performance of our business, and which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including today's press release and the risk factors and other information contained in our most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Red Hat assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements we may make on today's call. \r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Jim.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nThank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to announce that we delivered another strong quarter, with both revenue and profitability exceeding our guidance for Q3. Even more importantly, looking forward, we continued to strengthen our leadership position in the emerging open hybrid cloud sector. \r\nRed Hat associates are executing at a high level across the company as we further increase our strategic importance with customers. We believe that Red Hat is highly differentiated in our ability to help organizations transform their IT to be more agile and improve their customers' experiences. \r\nThis led to the Q3 results that demonstrated solid growth across all major geographies, consistently high revenue growth in both our infrastructure, as well as our application development and emerging technologies product groups. And we experienced large deal wins, cross-selling and strong renewals within our top deals.  The strength of our results are evidence of the strong demand for technologies that address the modernization of IT and customers' desire to work in an open hybrid cloud world. Red Hat continues to grow by better enabling our customers to build, deploy and manage their applications across multiple environments and infrastructures. \r\nWith that overview, let me discuss a few of our recent technology, marketing and partnership highlights. First, as a premier sponsor of the OpenStack Summit in Tokyo, we took the opportunity to highlight our enterprise customers' success stories across a variety of verticals including telecommunications, education and banking. At the conference, we also jointly demonstrated our NFV offerings for OpenStack with the service provider panel that included Verizon, China Mobile and Telus. In addition, we announced an expanded relationship with Lenovo to provide Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack platform with Lenovo hardware to bring more secure, reliable and flexible platforms to enterprise IT looking to build hybrid cloud deployments. \r\nSecond, we enhanced our management capabilities with the acquisition of Ansible, an open source IT automation software company launched in 2013. We chose Ansible because it is aligned with the core principles that shape Red Hat's management strategy in the following ways:\r\nAnsible is simple to use since it's agentless. Its playbooks make it easier to both write and maintain automation workflows. The team has built a highly popular open source project with a strong community. Ansible technologies support heterogeneous IT environments including Linux, Microsoft, AWS and the Google Cloud. And they expand our capabilities to offer application management across the 4 footprints of physical, virtual, private cloud and public cloud. \r\nThe integration of Ansible is well underway, and we're hearing strong interest from customers. And there is great internal excitement for the additional value they bring to our technology stack. In fact, the Ansible team had great momentum and closed several new wins, including their largest deal to date, a 6-figure deal with a global transportation technology provider. As part of our management portfolio, Ansible's role in dev ops and automation will be an important component of how Red Hat helps customers modernize their IT applications in the world of continuous deployment. \r\n \r\nThird, we launched a strategic partnership with Microsoft that was really a milestone event for the industry. Both Microsoft and Red Hat share the same view that it will be a hybrid cloud world, and we are working together to enable customers to realize the benefits of this transformation of IT. Let me describe and provide an update on some of the key elements of the partnership. \r\nRHEL is the preferred choice for enterprise Linux workflows on Azure and is now available for customers, representing the first deliverable of the partnership. We've already established customer -- have already enabled customers to take full advantage of their Red Hat subscriptions at Azure through the Red Hat Cloud Access program, where customers are able to bring their own subscriptions to run in Azure and be fully supported by both Red Hat and Microsoft. Customers will now be able to build and deploy applications in Azure using subscriptions of RHEL, JBoss EAP, JBoss Web Server, Red Hat Gluster Storage and OpenStack -- sorry, OpenShift PaaS.\r\nIn the coming months, Red Hat technologies on demand will also be available in Azure. These pay-as-you-go RHEL images will be available in the Azure marketplace and supported by Red Hat. Customers will be offered cross-platform, cross-company support spanning the Microsoft and Red Hat offerings in an integrated way, unlike any of our previous partnerships in the public cloud. We have already begun the co-locating support teams at Azure premises with the goal of making the customer experience simple and seamless at cloud speed. \r\nIn addition, being able to manage workloads across a variety of environments and infrastructures will be an important capability for customers in the hybrid cloud world. The management solution to do this will be our CloudForms technology. This month, we launched CloudForms 4.0, which gives customers the ability to manage RHEL on both Hyper-V and Azure. \r\nWe're also collaborating on .NET for our new generation of application development capabilities. The plan is it enable developers to access .NET technologies across Red Hat offerings, including OpenShift and RHEL, jointly backed by Microsoft and Red Hat. RHEL will be the primary Microsoft development and reference operating system for .NET Core on Linux. This is an exciting partnership for our joint customers, and I look forward to updating you on our progress. \r\nIn summary, I am pleased with our execution and results so far this year. I'm looking forward to a strong finish to the fiscal year, where we expect to achieve the $2 billion revenue milestone. Beyond this year, we have a compelling opportunity in front of us and exciting work to do to achieve our potential in the open hybrid cloud. \r\nIn closing, I want to thank Red Hat associates around the globe for their hard work. Red Hat's associates have created an exciting, enviable place to make a difference. In fact, Red Hat was recently recognized among the top 50 Best Places to Work in Glassdoor's 2016 survey. Red Hat has been built by a truly passionate and talented team, and I'm honored to be a part of it. \r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Frank.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nThank you, Jim. We executed well with another strong quarter, which resulted in our ability to exceed our guidance across a number of metrics. We continue to see our investments in emerging technologies, expanded partnerships in high-caliber sales teams contributing to the high growth. This marked our fourth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus total revenue growth on a constant-currency basis. \r\nLet me first start with my remarks with the financial highlights of our Q3 performance and then update our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. For a more detailed view of our results and metrics, please refer to our press release, supplemental metrics and a copy of our prepared remarks that are available in the Investor Relations section of redhat.com. \r\nHere are the Q3 financial highlights. We were pleased to see total revenue of $524 million, which grew 21% on a year-over-year basis in constant currency or 15% in U.S. dollars. Taking into account the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, total revenue would have been $28 million or 630 basis points higher using the rates from Q3 of last year. Due to the continued high FX volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant-currency results for the quarter using the rates from Q3 last year where it's appropriate. \r\nOur revenue performance for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance by approximately $1 million on a U.S. dollar basis and approximately $4 million when using the exchange rates we provided in our guidance in September. Our better-than-expected revenue performance this quarter resulted from continued strong demand that Jim just referenced, as well as execution across our organization. The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue of $457 million, an increase of 22% in constant currency and 16% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. This renewable revenue stream now constitutes 87% of total revenue, which provides us with a high level of revenue visibility in addition to future growth opportunities as we renew and expand our customer relationships. \r\nBreaking out the subscription revenue by technology, we are very pleased to see the subscription revenue for the Infrastructure-related offerings was $373 million, an increase of 18% in constant currency and 12% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. And particular to note, our subscription revenue for application development-related and emerging technologies offerings was $84 million, an increase of 45% in constant currency and 37% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Application development-related and emerging technologies revenue was approximately 60% of total revenue, and this is up from 14% of total revenue in the year-ago quarter. \r\nOn a non-GAAP basis, operating income grew 13%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 23.5%. This non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 60 basis points above our guidance, which as a reminder included the expenses related to the Ansible acquisition. The 60 basis points of margin upside was due in part to the stronger revenue growth. \r\nWith investments in our growth initiatives, we added approximately 400 associates this quarter, including approximately 50 associates related to the acquisition of Ansible. As we build our talent base of key skill sets, we have added approximately 950 associates through Q3 and we are on track to add more than 1,250 associates for the full fiscal year. \r\nUsing our estimated annual effective tax rate of 29%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.48, $0.02 above the guidance we provided after the Ansible acquisition. Higher revenue and disciplined spending were the main drivers of the EPS upside. \r\nWe ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $1.87 billion. We returned $78 million to shareholders from repurchasing approximately 987,000 shares of stock. And we had approximately $352 million remaining on the current share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter. \r\nTotal deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.49 billion, an increase of $187 million or 14% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant-currency basis, total deferred revenue would have been up 20%. The total change in deferred revenue from our cash flow statement that neutralizes most of the impact of currency fluctuations was an increase of $97 million. \r\nOperating cash flow of $140 million for the quarter was up 5% year-over-year. The timing of customer collections and cash disbursements can affect the growth rate on a single quarter basis. The year-to-date operating cash flow was up 16%. \r\nOur rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the billings proxy was $559 million, up 15% year-over-year. On a constant-currency basis, this metric would have been 21%. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus year-over-year growth, demonstrating our consistent growth in the business. This metric also reflects both the higher bookings duration in Q3 of last year of 24 months and the 22-month average duration we have experienced in Q3 of this fiscal year. As we look ahead, we would expect the bookings duration for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to be closer to the historic 21-month level compared to the 22 months in Q4 a year ago. \r\nI will now review the metrics for business momentum and the large deals in the quarter. Across all geographies, we saw continued growth in our bookings despite FX headwinds. This quarter, 60% of the bookings came from the Americas, 26% from EMEA and 14% from Asia-Pacific versus a 62%-25%-13% split in Q3 of last year. \r\nThe Q3 sales route to market mix was 67% from the channel and 33% from our direct sales force compared to a 70%-30% split in Q3 of last year. Consistent with Q3 seasonality, we closed a number of large direct deals and continue to target an annual goal of a 70%-30% split. \r\nWithin our top largest -- 30 top largest deals, all of them were approximately $1 million or more. Within that, we had 11 deals that were in excess of $5 million. And of these deals, 3 were over $10 million. \r\nCross-selling was strong, with 70% of the deals including one or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings. We expect the growing adoption of these technologies like Middleware, the RHEL OpenStack platform, OpenShift, cloud management and storage to continue to drive revenue growth.  \r\nThe top vertical for the quarter was financial followed closely by mainstream customers in sectors such as health care, transportation and retail. \r\nOn our renewal business, we once again renewed all of the top 25 deals that we were expecting. The total subscription value of these 25 renewals was approximately 120% of the prior value. \r\n \r\nJim discussed Red Hat's increasing strategic importance with customers. This quarter, we had a great example of this with the third largest deal of the quarter, a global financial services customer that renewed in excess of $10 million. First, let me give you some background. This global financial services customer was an early adopter of Linux and ran a mixed Linux environment. Around 2007, the customer decided on a Linux vendor offering free multiyear support on their Linux distribution. \r\nThe account team did not give up on this customer, and by fiscal year 2013, the customer decided to standardize on RHEL, and we closed a multiyear deal for approximately $2 million. Through exemplary account management, we renewed this customer this quarter to a significant 3-year commitment in excess of $10 million. We have not only expanded the footprint of RHEL, but we are also helping this customer realize the benefits of private cloud computing, software-defined storage and containers. This customer is now buying RHEL, CloudForms, Red Hat Storage, OpenShift and OpenStack. So I want to just say congratulations to the account team for an exceptional job of focusing on the needs of the customer. \r\nI would like now to turn to our guidance. Our outlook assumes similar business conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as of December 17, 2015, which included a dollar to euro of $1.09 and a yen to dollar of JPY 123. Foreign exchange rates remain very volatile and may change from the rates we are using today. Our guidance also reaffirms our Q4 outlook for the Ansible acquisition, which we closed in October. \r\nI'm pleased to announce that despite the impact of weaker foreign exchange rates, we are raising our full year revenue guidance to $2.044 billion to $2.048 billion, up approximately 15% in U.S. dollars or approximately 20% in constant currency at the high end of the range. The annual revenue guidance is up approximately $12 million in constant currency from the high end of range of our September guidance. \r\nWe are modestly increasing operating margin to approximately 23.5%, and we're improving the cash flow by tightening the range from $695 million to $705 million. \r\nWe are also increasing our target of full year non-GAAP earnings per share to approximately $1.86 per share, assuming a 29% annual effective tax rate and a $1 million per quarter forecast for other income. This EPS is approximately $0.03 higher than the midpoint of the guidance we provided after the Ansible acquisition. \r\nFor Q4 specifically, this implies the following outlook:  We expect revenue to be in the range of $535 million to $539 million, which is up 16% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range, or up approximately 20% in constant currency. This is an increase of $10 million from our previous implied fourth quarter guidance on a constant-currency basis. \r\nWe expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22.5%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of the $0.47. Both of these estimates include the previous guidance on the impact of Ansible in Q4, which equates to approximately $0.02 a share. \r\nConsistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow even though there is an implied range in the full year outlook. \r\nOverall, we are very pleased with our financial performance in the third quarter. We are excited about the strategic leadership position for both open source and hybrid cloud computing as we are confident in the long term to continue to grow our market share. Given our higher outlook for revenue, non-GAAP operating margin and EPS, we look forward to a strong finish to the fiscal year. \r\nOperator, I would now like to turn it back to you for the first question.",
      "transcript_text3": "I've got 2 related questions around the cloud. Frank, maybe you don't want to get into the habit of giving the run rate cloud subscription revenue number every quarter. But could you at least give some qualitative color on how it did relative to the $100 million figure that you provided us last quarter? And then related to that, maybe for Jim, Jim, the results are very strong. You've got to be the only infrastructure tech vendor that seems to be bucking this trend of complaining about sluggishness as clients move to the cloud or at least contemplate doing so. And perhaps it might be worthwhile for you to comment on how Red Hat is able to differentiate itself from all of the other peers in the infrastructure layer that seem to be experiencing a little bit of cloud-related pressure.\n\n---\n\nSo as far as the first question about the cloud, you're correct; we don't want to get into a habit of updating every quarter. But as we talked about, we are now very pleased that we have over 100 certified cloud service providers. And adding a new one this quarter with Microsoft, as Jim mentioned earlier, is a major step in the right direction. But as far as the performance this past quarter, we continue to see a similar performance that we've had the last couple of quarters, so very good growth rate. Jim?\n\n---\n\nAnd regarding I think what makes us different, recognize a big part of our go-to-market motion is taking share from our competitors. It always has been, whether that was UNIX to Linux or Windows to Linux or WebLogic to JBoss, and that continues. And actually, cloud accelerates that both because where workloads are built or migrated to cloud, they are often on Red Hat infrastructure; as well as, as people are looking to prepare workloads to potentially be on public or private cloud, that modernization typically means on a Red Hat infrastructure. So we continue to take share nicely as well as win solid share of new workloads that are moving to cloud.\n\n---\n\nSo Jim, I wanted to revisit the last Analyst Day. You had commented that OpenStack was almost entirely supply constrained at that time. And so I'm wondering if -- first, if you can update us on that dynamic. But also, you commented that as OpenStack matures over time, it will become easier to install, and therefore, at some point, those 2 lines would cross. And so I'm curious if you can comment on the progress there in terms of making it easier to install. Then, I have a follow-up.\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, with our RHEL OpenStack Platform 7, right, we put our first kind of automated installer in there. That's kind of the first release of that with the version. So it's getting easier to install, and both Red Hat and customers are building more capability around OpenStack. I would still say that the primary gate to even faster adoption of OpenStack are, for us, bookings, billings, revenue related to OpenStack has to do with our ability to get enough people in market to do it. It takes a long time. You've got to do the POC, you've got to migrate workload, et cetera, et cetera, and that's just the kind of a long process for infrastructure. So I think we're continuing to make progress, but it's still we're -- and I think you'll continue to see us make progress, but it's still more supply constrained than demand.\n\n---\n\nAnd, Mark, do you have a follow-up?\n\n---\n\nYes, I did. So Jim, I was curious, do you think that Oracle pushing its cloud applications this intensely is -- in any way is driving indirect benefit to Red Hat? So just, for example, if Oracle is less focused on middleware, less focused on UNIX, less focused on core infrastructure, perhaps it benefits JBoss and RHEL, so there is a very big divergence in the growth trajectories. And I'm just wondering how much of that you think might be kind of a one-for-one exchange of market share.\n\n---\n\nNo. Well, that's the first. I haven't actually been out in the market, seen anything kind of directly going on there. We are picking up momentum in general on the middleware side of WebSphere and WebLogic migrations. But I think that has more to do with comfort and the maturity of the products as well -- especially as you kind of go up into integration and business process management. I would never think that Oracle's sales team is taking their eye off the ball. I just think we're solidly kind of winning business as our products mature.\n\n---\n\nCan I go back to Karl's questions on the public cloud? Now with Azure on, can you talk a little bit about -- I mean, Azure is obviously or seems to be the second largest cloud out there, but it's much smaller than AWS and it's a relatively new relationship with Microsoft for you guys. How do you think about -- what's your expectation? And I understand if you don't want to go into specific numbers about the ramp that you see from that new partner.\n\n---\n\nWell I'll start quickly. Again, it's too early to get a sense on numbers. What I will say, I think Azure in general is more enterprise focused. And we have 100 certified cloud providers, and we do see larger kind of RHEL shares on clouds that are more enterprise focused. And so I think we're optimistic that we'll see something similar with Azure given, again, it's relatively greater focused on kind of larger enterprise.\n\n---\n\nMy question on the private cloud side. You talked about this large deal. I'm just wondering what's your expectation when you look into 2016. We have been hearing about this cyber cloud addition. What are you seeing in the market in terms of enterprise considering moving to private cloud, building scale out architecture? And then how do you position yourself versus other vendors' framework? I'm just not talking about open source, but who are the other vendors and how do you put yourself against those?\n\n---\n\nYes, you bring up an interesting point that, well frankly, we could spend an hour on. But at a high level, I think you see certainly a set of enterprises building private cloud specifically for scale out only workloads. But frankly, one of the reasons we've seen really strong traction with OpenShift is the fact that we do support persistence so we can handle Mode 1 applications on OpenShift. And I do think it's one of the things that's driving, I think, really strong OpenShift performance. We didn't talk about it, we hadn't been asked about it this much, but we've seen a really strong performance there. And I think that's because enterprises see that they can have kind of both kind of Mode 1 and Mode 2 worlds on the PaaS side. And there's really no good competitor to that out there in terms of if you want to do -- want to dock your containers at scale on a GA platform, it's us. And so that's been a real key differentiator and driver of growth for us.\n\n---\n\nIn your public cloud business, you've talked about I think around half of the customers being smaller businesses. I was wondering, do have a good feel for why these customers are choosing Red Hat versus let's say, stock Linux? And could this accelerate your growth if more smaller companies choose RHEL in the cloud, which is not an area you've historically targeted?\n\n---\n\nWell, look, yes. I do think that's what we believe that all of that small and medium business, the vast majority of the small and medium business, RHEL that we're getting on the clouds is net new because we don't really have a coverage market model for that, so we do think it's net new. In terms of why, you get the security benefits, you get the stability benefits. We have a much higher tier of support. I mean, that whole value proposition works just as well for smaller companies as it does for larger ones. So yes, we certainly believe that shows through to people who understand open source.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions. One, where do you think the bulk of the growth in Linux is coming from? If there's any chance you could stack the contributors there in terms of growth. And then in the infrastructure of, let's say, on SaaS -- excuse me, on OpenShift PaaS and other pieces of cloud infrastructure, is it mostly private cloud? Or are there are some public cloud sales as well, meaning sales to public cloud providers?\n\n---\n\nOn OpenShift in particular?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nIn emerging.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Or emerging, yes. So in terms of Linux, most of it comes from we win a very high share of net new workloads. So while I think there's a shift going on, there continues to be some UNIX to Linux migrations, and that kind of continues well. But a lot of the share shift just happens because we get a larger share of the application portfolio because new applications are much more likely to be built on RHEL. And so that drives the natural share shift as we get a larger and larger percentage of the application portfolio every year. In terms of OpenShift, we just launched the Dedicated Instances, which a lot of our enterprises wanted a couple of weeks ago. So virtually, all of the traction that I was talking about in terms of dollars and the big deals is all on-premise OpenShift Enterprise. That said, we're up to let's say, 2.8-plus million applications running on OpenShift Online. It continues to grow really, really nicely. So we are seeing nice traction there as well.\n\n---\n\nHiring was obviously strong this quarter, and you sort of alluded to your expectations for Q4. I know it's early but, Frank, can you give us any sense for how margins might scale next year? Or maybe more generically, what is your high level framework when thinking about midterm margin enhancement?\n\n---\n\nSo the key thing, and we've talked about this in the past, what we're trying to do as far as even this year with the hiring that we've done, is make sure that we are positioning ourselves for growth. And we're looking at it in 2 ways. First of all, from an engineering perspective, in addition to the base core business that we've had and expanding the platform, especially around the emerging products, sales support, platform and engineering is where we've had the growth this year. But even more important is to scale from a global perspective in being able to bring those emerging technologies out into that global marketplace. So getting additional coverage as well as working with various partners in investments that we have to make in our go-to-market to get broader coverage and be able to sustain and improve that growth rate has been the focus. One of the things that we talked about over the last 2 quarters is trying to accelerate the investment in Q3 and Q4, which we have done. It is part of what we just saw this quarter and what's in the forecast for the next quarter, to enable us to continue with that story as we go into the new fiscal year. As far as the margins, I mean I think we've had very healthy margins this year, closing out the year at operating margin at 23.5%, I think, is extremely well positioned. It's slightly above where we were last year. And our objective, and I know that's also what investors are looking for, is to enable us to continue that. But again, we're trying to balance, grow as well as also sustain those margins. So as we get into closing out this year and we give our guidance for FY '17, I think we'll have a better sense for how that will be for next year. And we're doing a lot of that strategic planning right now. It's underway for the last month or so, and we'll continue that throughout this quarter. And I think that will help us position the right balance of going after growth and the investments we need to support that so we'll be able to see good profitability.\n\n---\n\nI was just wondering if Jim, maybe you can talk a little bit about the open source database market. And I'm just wondering if you think it would be important for Red Hat to be involved in that area over time? Or is there -- would it make sense for you guys to kind of own the complete stack at some point?\n\n---\n\nWell, look, I mean like look at this. I don't think there's a strategic reason that we need to own the database, and there's still a lot of innovation happening, especially on the NoSQL side. So I don't think we need to. Is it an adjacency that would be an opportunity and do we have credibility with customers and certainly the capability of doing that? Obviously, yes, we do, and customers ask us about it all the time. We have enough other things on our plate right now that it hasn't bubbled to the top of the list. But it's certainly something we have both kind of brand permission from our customers and capability to do. But we have great partners in that space right now, and we have a lot of other things that we're looking to execute on, so at this point, it hasn't kind of hit our radar as an area to do a product offering. That's expensive. It's a different buyer. It's a whole different set of technologies. So making the decision to do that and do that as a kind of mission-critical way that Red Hat does open source, it would be expensive. So we're focused on cloud right now.\n\n---\n\nJim or Frank, when we look at the drivers of large deals, how much of those are existing customers upsizing their commitment at renewal time versus new customers coming in at a much higher level? And how should we think about this momentum? Because we saw this massive uptick in these large deals over the last couple of years, but we are getting close to anniversary-ing a lot of those renewals. So how should we think about the momentum over the next few years?\n\n---\n\nWell, to answer your question, we've got a good mix, which is a good model to have. The examples that I provided earlier is a good example of a renewal where it was kind of an improvement in the amount, like 120% above what they were spending before. So we're seeing on average not only a high amount of renewals, but also an increase in the amount of purchase spend. And more likely in most of the scenarios, it's really kind of expanding across emerging products, right. So and that's why even in our top deals, we're seeing more with OpenStack, OpenShift, Middleware. So that's a good momentum and it's continuing for the last couple of quarters. I would expect that to continue as we look at the next couple of quarters and seeing a similar type balance. So as I said, it's a good model to have.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to go back and then maybe dig in a little bit more on that margin question that we talked about earlier, maybe focusing a little bit on Q4. You're guiding to margins being down sequentially. So just wondering from a high level, like why that would be? Sort of why going into that Q4, we will see sort of a step-down in margins? And obviously, the answer to some extent is going to be additional investments. And to the degree that it is additional investments, where in particular are you guys focusing those investments right now?\n\n---\n\nSo the first thing I just want to mention as far as Q4, Q4 does assume the acquisition of Ansible, right. So as we mentioned back when we announced the acquisition that, that was going to be an expense that we had Q3 but most of it in Q4. So that's factored in there, so you need to kind of look at it from that perspective. And then back on what I was saying as far as the investments, more of the investments are in the expansion of our go-to-market so that we can help support the emerging products, which tend to have a longer sales cycle, and enable to continue the momentum that we're seeing in OpenStack and OpenShift, and then also from the perspective of coverage, right. Because we do not have -- we've been growing at a great rate, but we still have opportunity in all our geographies to go after new accounts. And it goes back to even the question that we had before. It's great that we have the renewals and we have the upsell, but we also want to make sure that we're going after new accounts. And as we go into FY '17, that's a major focus for us is to go after new accounts. And in order to go after new accounts, you have some investments that you need to make. So a combination of new accounts investment, as well as the expansion of the emerging market. Just earlier today, I was talking with our service -- lead of our services business, and that's another great example as far as the investment we're making in services. Services is kind of a presale for us to get customers on RHEL, or more importantly, to get them on emerging products. And usually, it requires an investment somewhere in the 6- to 9-month time frame. So we're making those kinds of investments, which is going to bring future growth.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then if I could sneak one last one in just again coming back to the competitive environment. Just kind of wondering about VMware. They're going through a lot of organizational sort of changes we'll say right now. And any sort of let up in the competitive environment against them or any opportunity given the potential distraction that they're seeing that may be a benefit to you guys right now?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, I think a couple of things. I think that a lot of the distraction that's been happening I think makes people really start questioning when vendors change hands, start saying, \"Well, wow, how locked am I -- locked into them am I?\" So I think it does help highlight our value proposition of lack of lock-in. And then, just broadly, as people start thinking about private cloud and scale-out architectures, we have a compelling value proposition and that immediately gets people thinking, \"Well, what about for my statefull [ph] application?\" So RHEV for us, which is our scale-up VMware competitor, has continued to do well as we get in conversations around workloads. So I want to do OpenStack, but if I'm going to do that for scale out, I may as well look at RHEV with a similar technology stack under my scale up workload. So certainly, also the cloud thing is helping us as we talk to customers about long-term, what they want to do with their core virtualization stacks as well.\n\n---\n\nFirst on OpenStack. It feels like the awareness of OpenStack is somewhat greater than the awareness of Red Hat OpenStack. I'm wondering if you would agree with that and what needs to be done there. And also secondly, for you, Frank, the duration adjustment should not really affect your short-term deferred revenue growth, right? And in that regard, do you think that you'd be able to sustain your current top line revenue growth the way your short-term deferred revenue growth has been coming through?\n\n---\n\nWell, I'll start on OpenStack, right. So on OpenStack, recognize Red Hat's value proposition is everything we do around productization of open source. So when you put something into production, people turn to Red Hat. So yes, there are a lot of -- even our good customers playing around with OpenStack in the lab and whether that's community or kind of professional services supported stuff. And many of them will say, \"When we put in production, obviously we're going to use Red Hat OpenStack platform.\" So as people start putting things in production, we pick up traction there. So yes, there's a lot of experimentation out there, and that's great because as people get more comfortable with it and get closer to put it in production, they come back to us. And we've seen that already happening with customers. So yes, I mean, we do have a lot of OpenStack out there, which is great because ultimately, again, that should come our way when people put it in production.\n\n---\n\nThe other thing going, we've talked about this. I just want to add to Jim's comment about OpenStack. Because as far as the overall community, we have close to 4,000 certified engineers, which is 3x what the number was last year. So we're seeing a lot of momentum. And we believe and more customers that we talk to and more forums that we go to on this whole topic, Red Hat is front and center. So I would kind of really want to emphasize that. As far as the other part of your question, as I mentioned earlier and we've said in the past, if you look at our contract duration, historically, it's been around 21 months, and so it can fluctuate a little higher, a little lower. But 21 months seems to be the historic duration. It's one that we're actually saying is going to be the case as we go into Q4. That 21-month, that duration, that short-term deferred also supports our revenue for the coming years. So I think we're not giving guidance for FY '17, but clearly, our objective would be to help support that type of continuation of a growth rate going forward with the new opportunities, both renewals as well as new customers. And I think that 21 months is a fairly reasonable rate to sustain over a period of time.\n\n---\n\nFrank, just back on operating margins. For the last 7 years, you've been in a pretty tight range on op margin. We certainly understand that the growth has been the #1 priority. But is there anything structurally that you see, having gone onboard recently, that makes you believe that -- it just seems with the recurring revenue, the subscription model, that this was coming back at a high margin. What are the big investments now that you see that you need to make that keep these margins in this range? Or do you feel like there's a breakout that could come here profitability with the growth?\n\n---\n\nI don't see -- I haven't seen anything in the 5 months, almost 6 months that I've been here from a structural standpoint that would have to change from that perspective. I think, again, it goes back to what I was saying before, very healthy operating margins, that's been very successful for Red Hat for a number of years. Our objective is to continue to leverage that as best as we can. But we also want to make sure, and I continue to say this, make sure that we're making the investments to help support the growth. I wouldn't want to be in the situation a year from now or 2 years from now trying to struggle to get the growth rate. You have to be keep being ahead of that. So of course, it's always that balance, right. And then I think, Jim, the rest of the management team, myself, that's clearly what we want to do. We want to keep that balance as best we can. But a key priority for us is to help support that growth. It's what our customers are asking for and where we think there's an opportunity for. It goes back to some of the earlier comments that we made about open source and how well it's positioned right now with customers versus some of the proprietary options that have been there in the past. So we want to make sure we can ride that as best as we can.\n\n---\n\nYes, and just keep in mind, the stuff that's growing at 45% year-over-year is newer stuff, and therefore has a higher cost of sale in the short run as we talked about with OpenStack and POCs and OpenShift, et cetera, et cetera. So our business growing in the mid- to high-teens has a lower cost of sales than our business growing at 45%. So there is a mix issue in there that has been inherent for the last several years.\n\n---\n\nAnd again, we're going to provide the type of judgment and perspective, as you would expect, as we look at the opportunities and we weigh the investments that we have to make. And we're looking at our business. The other thing I just want to mention is we're looking at our business now more longer term. So we're looking at our business over several years. And so we're looking at investments and the return and the payback we expect to get, as I'm sure most investors would want us to do. So we'll make sure that we balance that in the portfolio.\n\n---\n\nI'd like to ask about the go-to-market. And specifically, with OpenShift and the dev side of the house kind of coming up the curve rapidly, you obviously stepped-up your hiring on the direct side. Number one, what are kind of some of the resources you'd need around quota sales reps on that side of the business that you maybe need to train or to bring on to support the growth there? And second, separately, do you need an indirect channel, some partners on the dev side to help drive that business going forward?\n\n---\n\nWell look, I mean, you see we do have a lot of channel business today. What I would say is the good news on OpenShift is it is the same buyer as much of the JBoss portfolio, so we already have relationships on the dev side of the house. And so that same sales force is able to sell OpenShift. So certainly, given that's part of that stuff that's growing at 45%, we're obviously adding a lot of people to service that. So certainly, it's a big chunk of our growth. In terms of channel partners, yes, we definitely have some and we'd like to have more. Again, these are earlier technologies that require a lot of handholding and POCs upfront, which makes them a little less channel-friendly. I think we're very excited about things like OpenShift, the dedicated instances of OpenShift Online. That's something enterprises want and makes it much more channel-ready and easy to sell. So we'll certainly look, as OpenShift kind of gets more mature and with the online Dedicated Instances, at leveraging our channel partners more, which obviously then helps again with just the overall cost of sale.\n\n---\n\nFrank, just a quick one on my end. On the currency impact, could you just give us the impact of currency on the cash or on the balance sheet deferred revenue broken out by short term and long term? I think I either missed it or you didn't give it.\n\n---\n\nYes. Let me just look for it. Why don't you go to the next question? I'll find it and I'll come back to give that to you.\n\n---\n\nIt's also in the supplemental metrics that we published. So if you want to find it there as well, but we'll read out from there.\n\n---\n\nRight. I think it's on the second page of -- yes, Page 10 in the attachment that we sent out. It even has kind of the breakout of the short-term deferred revenue and the long-term deferred revenue.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to ask about geography. It looks like EMEA and APAC growth have generally been accelerating over the last couple of quarters. And the bookings numbers looked particularly good out of those -- both those regions as well. I was just hoping you could talk about what may be contributing to this pickup and how you'd characterize the demand environment and maybe just some of the dynamics going on out there in terms of open source adoption.\n\n---\n\nSo I'll just clarify. So the growth rates from a region perspective, in Americas constant currency, we've provided that now about 19%; EMEA was 25%; Asia-Pac was 23%. So as we said, I mean, we've got some pretty good growth across all the regions, which is great to see. I would say that there's nothing in particular, just going back to the analysis, that would come out that would highlight any difference between any one of the regions. I'm thinking about just the types of deals, the types of emerging products, it's been fairly consistent.\n\n---\n\nYes, there's nothing that comes to mind to me either. I think if any -- North America had such a strong year last year, there might be a little relative comp, but I think...\n\n---\n\nNorth America probably, I mean, a little bit more public sector, I would say, but...\n\n---\n\nYes, yes. I think overall, I'd say it's pretty similar across the world. I don't think there are any regions that are particularly strong or weak. It's been pretty solid across the board.\n\n---\n\nWondering if you could talk a little bit of where we are in this OpenStack movement. There's been a lot of hype around it. It seems like the opportunity is big. But when do you think it's really going to reach an inflection point and start to matter for Red Hat?\n\n---\n\nThese things do take a while because this is not -- if you kind of say the big last trend, virtualization, right? Virtualization slid underneath existing workloads. And so we try -- and it was primarily VMware sold in a license model. And you put those things together, it was able to kind of balloon up really, really quick. This is the infrastructure for the next generation of computing. And so it is net new workloads. And as people build scale out workloads, they are highly likely, if they're going to run on prem, to run on OpenStack. And so it will be big, but the relative way in which it will scale over time will just be a more natural ramp. So at some point, in any ramp, there's kind of the S-curve kink up. And is that kink up next year or just beyond? It's hard to exactly say. We're really, really pleased with the customers, the workloads people are putting on it, the experience that people are now having. So at some point, the S-curve will really kind of kink up, but it's hard for me to give you an exact kind of time on that.\n\n---\n\nOne of -- and we are spending a lot of time internally thinking about what types of metrics would be a good indicator that we can then share at some point in the future that would give investors a better sense for some of that traction. So as we continue to look at that, we feel comfortable with certain metrics. We'll try to find a way to share that as well.\n\n---\n\nI wonder if you could comment whether you had any stand-alone emerging products deals and how the Fuse middleware and embedded businesses are tracking.\n\n---\n\nFuse.\n\n---\n\nWe had a couple of good -- just looking at -- we had -- in the top 30 deals, we had 3 with Fuse, which was pretty consistent with what we've seen in prior quarters. I'm just looking across some of the key deals.\n\n---\n\nWell, frankly, the key deal, I will say Fuse has been, I think, a standout performer for us in terms of it's just done, I think, far beyond our expectations when we acquired FuseSource. We're seeing it just all over the place in a number of our customers. So we obviously don't break it out, but it's become a pretty substantial product in the portfolio for us. Sorry, we're also counting as we're talking here. Let's see. One...\n\n---\n\nI've got the number here, Jim. Frank's got the number.\n\n---\n\nYes, there're 3 here. So that all the -- just [indiscernible] part, 5 in the app related -- app development-related emerging technologies. We had 7 with OpenStack, 5 with OpenShift, 1 with CloudForms, 3 had Fuse, as I said. 7 in Storage, which was very good across the board, and we had 4 with RHEV.\n\n---\n\nYes, how many deals had just emerging or just middleware?\n\n---\n\n5.\n\n---\n\n5 were just -- okay. Yes.\n\n---\n\nSo 5 was yes, outside of RHEL.\n\n---\n\nGentlemen, I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit about just the adoptions of the emerging technologies outside the U.S. I assume the adoption inside the U.S is probably faster than what you're seeing internationally. I guess is there any sort of lag or anything you could -- and I guess, around that, do you feel like the emerging technologies distribution platform still needs to be built out internationally? Or is it just simply sort of a technology adoption update that you see, U.S. then international?\n\n---\n\nYes, surprisingly, we actually see the emerging technologies doing just as well internationally as we see in the U.S. Especially, OpenShift, OpenStack, I mean, really strong adoption internationally. The only thing that was a downer is it's even harder to find skilled resources in some of these countries, language capabilities, et cetera, et cetera. So internationally, we are very much supply constrained. Eight of our top 30 deals were in EMEA, to give an example. But even on the emerging products, again I've just got back from trips to both Asia and EMEA, and most of those conversations are around containers and dev ops and OpenStack, OpenShift. And so I don't really see any difference, which I agree with you is kind of a bit surprising. We generally think of the U.S. as an early adopter, but it really is strong across the world.\n\n---\n\nI would love more of a behind-the-scenes look on how the Microsoft and Red Hat partnership came together. I mean was this a situation where you were courting each other for multiple years and you finally pulled the trigger? Or was it more of a situation where just the dynamics of the infrastructure market was changing so quickly that you decided to tie the knot quickly? And I guess Part B of that question is what sort of milestone should we be tracking with respect to the Microsoft partnership? I mean, what should we -- what metric should we used to judge whether or not the partnership is ultimately a success?\n\n---\n\nWell, I'll start. I mean, this took a while for it to come together. There are a lot of complexities around intellectual property and other things that we needed to make sure that we had right that were fully consistent with the GPL and our open source principles, and those things took a while. So no, the discussions have been underway for quite a long time. I think for both of us, we've had a lot of customers pushing us both to do this. A lot of customers, their infrastructure runs on RHEL, and they decided they would like to run that on Azure. And so this was really customer-driven that we ultimately got it done, but it was a -- kind of several quarters' worth of work to actually get it done. We're excited about the results.\n\n---\n\nAnd the other thing, as far as the second part, I mean, again, as we mentioned earlier, it's early, having just closed the deal. And now we're making sure that the 2 companies can come together on the key areas. Of course, the first one is to be able to make the offering available to customers and start tracking the customers that actually move on to RHEL on Azure. Secondly, we have an agreement between the 2 companies to co-locate engineers to make sure that we can support some of the customers and make it a much better experience for them. We've already started that, and we've got engineers on both sides. We'll continue to ramp those engineers as necessary, so kind of monitoring their success. Working between 2 companies is always a challenge, but we feel optimistic that we can kind of work to it. The other piece is the .NET. And again, it's early, so we want to see what type of traction that we have on .NET. And then also just explore what other options we have working with Microsoft Azure as far as some of our other products, and that's where I think there's a lot more value. So as we continue to work through this, we'll come up with some metrics. Clearly, we have metrics internally, but ones that I think we can sure use externally to give you some traction or give you some indication of how the traction's working over time.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And on behalf of everyone here, we want to thank our investors and the analyst community for all the support they've given us this year. We look forward to talking to you all in the next couple of weeks and clearly into next year. Thank you very much for joining us today.\n\n---\n\nHappy holidays, everyone.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Karl Keirstead (Analysts)】\nI've got 2 related questions around the cloud. Frank, maybe you don't want to get into the habit of giving the run rate cloud subscription revenue number every quarter. But could you at least give some qualitative color on how it did relative to the $100 million figure that you provided us last quarter? And then related to that, maybe for Jim, Jim, the results are very strong. You've got to be the only infrastructure tech vendor that seems to be bucking this trend of complaining about sluggishness as clients move to the cloud or at least contemplate doing so. And perhaps it might be worthwhile for you to comment on how Red Hat is able to differentiate itself from all of the other peers in the infrastructure layer that seem to be experiencing a little bit of cloud-related pressure.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nSo as far as the first question about the cloud, you're correct; we don't want to get into a habit of updating every quarter. But as we talked about, we are now very pleased that we have over 100 certified cloud service providers. And adding a new one this quarter with Microsoft, as Jim mentioned earlier, is a major step in the right direction. But as far as the performance this past quarter, we continue to see a similar performance that we've had the last couple of quarters, so very good growth rate. Jim?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nAnd regarding I think what makes us different, recognize a big part of our go-to-market motion is taking share from our competitors. It always has been, whether that was UNIX to Linux or Windows to Linux or WebLogic to JBoss, and that continues. And actually, cloud accelerates that both because where workloads are built or migrated to cloud, they are often on Red Hat infrastructure; as well as, as people are looking to prepare workloads to potentially be on public or private cloud, that modernization typically means on a Red Hat infrastructure. So we continue to take share nicely as well as win solid share of new workloads that are moving to cloud.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Murphy (Analysts)】\nSo Jim, I wanted to revisit the last Analyst Day. You had commented that OpenStack was almost entirely supply constrained at that time. And so I'm wondering if -- first, if you can update us on that dynamic. But also, you commented that as OpenStack matures over time, it will become easier to install, and therefore, at some point, those 2 lines would cross. And so I'm curious if you can comment on the progress there in terms of making it easier to install. Then, I have a follow-up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes. Well, with our RHEL OpenStack Platform 7, right, we put our first kind of automated installer in there. That's kind of the first release of that with the version. So it's getting easier to install, and both Red Hat and customers are building more capability around OpenStack. I would still say that the primary gate to even faster adoption of OpenStack are, for us, bookings, billings, revenue related to OpenStack has to do with our ability to get enough people in market to do it. It takes a long time. You've got to do the POC, you've got to migrate workload, et cetera, et cetera, and that's just the kind of a long process for infrastructure. So I think we're continuing to make progress, but it's still we're -- and I think you'll continue to see us make progress, but it's still more supply constrained than demand.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nAnd, Mark, do you have a follow-up?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Murphy (Analysts)】\nYes, I did. So Jim, I was curious, do you think that Oracle pushing its cloud applications this intensely is -- in any way is driving indirect benefit to Red Hat? So just, for example, if Oracle is less focused on middleware, less focused on UNIX, less focused on core infrastructure, perhaps it benefits JBoss and RHEL, so there is a very big divergence in the growth trajectories. And I'm just wondering how much of that you think might be kind of a one-for-one exchange of market share.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nNo. Well, that's the first. I haven't actually been out in the market, seen anything kind of directly going on there. We are picking up momentum in general on the middleware side of WebSphere and WebLogic migrations. But I think that has more to do with comfort and the maturity of the products as well -- especially as you kind of go up into integration and business process management. I would never think that Oracle's sales team is taking their eye off the ball. I just think we're solidly kind of winning business as our products mature.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Raimo Lenschow (Analysts)】\nCan I go back to Karl's questions on the public cloud? Now with Azure on, can you talk a little bit about -- I mean, Azure is obviously or seems to be the second largest cloud out there, but it's much smaller than AWS and it's a relatively new relationship with Microsoft for you guys. How do you think about -- what's your expectation? And I understand if you don't want to go into specific numbers about the ramp that you see from that new partner.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell I'll start quickly. Again, it's too early to get a sense on numbers. What I will say, I think Azure in general is more enterprise focused. And we have 100 certified cloud providers, and we do see larger kind of RHEL shares on clouds that are more enterprise focused. And so I think we're optimistic that we'll see something similar with Azure given, again, it's relatively greater focused on kind of larger enterprise.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sitikantha Panigrahi (Analysts)】\nMy question on the private cloud side. You talked about this large deal. I'm just wondering what's your expectation when you look into 2016. We have been hearing about this cyber cloud addition. What are you seeing in the market in terms of enterprise considering moving to private cloud, building scale out architecture? And then how do you position yourself versus other vendors' framework? I'm just not talking about open source, but who are the other vendors and how do you put yourself against those?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes, you bring up an interesting point that, well frankly, we could spend an hour on. But at a high level, I think you see certainly a set of enterprises building private cloud specifically for scale out only workloads. But frankly, one of the reasons we've seen really strong traction with OpenShift is the fact that we do support persistence so we can handle Mode 1 applications on OpenShift. And I do think it's one of the things that's driving, I think, really strong OpenShift performance. We didn't talk about it, we hadn't been asked about it this much, but we've seen a really strong performance there. And I think that's because enterprises see that they can have kind of both kind of Mode 1 and Mode 2 worlds on the PaaS side. And there's really no good competitor to that out there in terms of if you want to do -- want to dock your containers at scale on a GA platform, it's us. And so that's been a real key differentiator and driver of growth for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Ader (Analysts)】\nIn your public cloud business, you've talked about I think around half of the customers being smaller businesses. I was wondering, do have a good feel for why these customers are choosing Red Hat versus let's say, stock Linux? And could this accelerate your growth if more smaller companies choose RHEL in the cloud, which is not an area you've historically targeted?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, look, yes. I do think that's what we believe that all of that small and medium business, the vast majority of the small and medium business, RHEL that we're getting on the clouds is net new because we don't really have a coverage market model for that, so we do think it's net new. In terms of why, you get the security benefits, you get the stability benefits. We have a much higher tier of support. I mean, that whole value proposition works just as well for smaller companies as it does for larger ones. So yes, we certainly believe that shows through to people who understand open source.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Turits (Analysts)】\nTwo questions. One, where do you think the bulk of the growth in Linux is coming from? If there's any chance you could stack the contributors there in terms of growth. And then in the infrastructure of, let's say, on SaaS -- excuse me, on OpenShift PaaS and other pieces of cloud infrastructure, is it mostly private cloud? Or are there are some public cloud sales as well, meaning sales to public cloud providers?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nOn OpenShift in particular?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Turits (Analysts)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nIn emerging.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nOkay. Or emerging, yes. So in terms of Linux, most of it comes from we win a very high share of net new workloads. So while I think there's a shift going on, there continues to be some UNIX to Linux migrations, and that kind of continues well. But a lot of the share shift just happens because we get a larger share of the application portfolio because new applications are much more likely to be built on RHEL. And so that drives the natural share shift as we get a larger and larger percentage of the application portfolio every year. In terms of OpenShift, we just launched the Dedicated Instances, which a lot of our enterprises wanted a couple of weeks ago. So virtually, all of the traction that I was talking about in terms of dollars and the big deals is all on-premise OpenShift Enterprise. That said, we're up to let's say, 2.8-plus million applications running on OpenShift Online. It continues to grow really, really nicely. So we are seeing nice traction there as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Hedberg (Analysts)】\nHiring was obviously strong this quarter, and you sort of alluded to your expectations for Q4. I know it's early but, Frank, can you give us any sense for how margins might scale next year? Or maybe more generically, what is your high level framework when thinking about midterm margin enhancement?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nSo the key thing, and we've talked about this in the past, what we're trying to do as far as even this year with the hiring that we've done, is make sure that we are positioning ourselves for growth. And we're looking at it in 2 ways. First of all, from an engineering perspective, in addition to the base core business that we've had and expanding the platform, especially around the emerging products, sales support, platform and engineering is where we've had the growth this year. But even more important is to scale from a global perspective in being able to bring those emerging technologies out into that global marketplace. So getting additional coverage as well as working with various partners in investments that we have to make in our go-to-market to get broader coverage and be able to sustain and improve that growth rate has been the focus. One of the things that we talked about over the last 2 quarters is trying to accelerate the investment in Q3 and Q4, which we have done. It is part of what we just saw this quarter and what's in the forecast for the next quarter, to enable us to continue with that story as we go into the new fiscal year. As far as the margins, I mean I think we've had very healthy margins this year, closing out the year at operating margin at 23.5%, I think, is extremely well positioned. It's slightly above where we were last year. And our objective, and I know that's also what investors are looking for, is to enable us to continue that. But again, we're trying to balance, grow as well as also sustain those margins. So as we get into closing out this year and we give our guidance for FY '17, I think we'll have a better sense for how that will be for next year. And we're doing a lot of that strategic planning right now. It's underway for the last month or so, and we'll continue that throughout this quarter. And I think that will help us position the right balance of going after growth and the investments we need to support that so we'll be able to see good profitability.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Heather Bellini (Analysts)】\nI was just wondering if Jim, maybe you can talk a little bit about the open source database market. And I'm just wondering if you think it would be important for Red Hat to be involved in that area over time? Or is there -- would it make sense for you guys to kind of own the complete stack at some point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, look, I mean like look at this. I don't think there's a strategic reason that we need to own the database, and there's still a lot of innovation happening, especially on the NoSQL side. So I don't think we need to. Is it an adjacency that would be an opportunity and do we have credibility with customers and certainly the capability of doing that? Obviously, yes, we do, and customers ask us about it all the time. We have enough other things on our plate right now that it hasn't bubbled to the top of the list. But it's certainly something we have both kind of brand permission from our customers and capability to do. But we have great partners in that space right now, and we have a lot of other things that we're looking to execute on, so at this point, it hasn't kind of hit our radar as an area to do a product offering. That's expensive. It's a different buyer. It's a whole different set of technologies. So making the decision to do that and do that as a kind of mission-critical way that Red Hat does open source, it would be expensive. So we're focused on cloud right now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Abhey Lamba (Analysts)】\nJim or Frank, when we look at the drivers of large deals, how much of those are existing customers upsizing their commitment at renewal time versus new customers coming in at a much higher level? And how should we think about this momentum? Because we saw this massive uptick in these large deals over the last couple of years, but we are getting close to anniversary-ing a lot of those renewals. So how should we think about the momentum over the next few years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nWell, to answer your question, we've got a good mix, which is a good model to have. The examples that I provided earlier is a good example of a renewal where it was kind of an improvement in the amount, like 120% above what they were spending before. So we're seeing on average not only a high amount of renewals, but also an increase in the amount of purchase spend. And more likely in most of the scenarios, it's really kind of expanding across emerging products, right. So and that's why even in our top deals, we're seeing more with OpenStack, OpenShift, Middleware. So that's a good momentum and it's continuing for the last couple of quarters. I would expect that to continue as we look at the next couple of quarters and seeing a similar type balance. So as I said, it's a good model to have.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Weiss (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to go back and then maybe dig in a little bit more on that margin question that we talked about earlier, maybe focusing a little bit on Q4. You're guiding to margins being down sequentially. So just wondering from a high level, like why that would be? Sort of why going into that Q4, we will see sort of a step-down in margins? And obviously, the answer to some extent is going to be additional investments. And to the degree that it is additional investments, where in particular are you guys focusing those investments right now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nSo the first thing I just want to mention as far as Q4, Q4 does assume the acquisition of Ansible, right. So as we mentioned back when we announced the acquisition that, that was going to be an expense that we had Q3 but most of it in Q4. So that's factored in there, so you need to kind of look at it from that perspective. And then back on what I was saying as far as the investments, more of the investments are in the expansion of our go-to-market so that we can help support the emerging products, which tend to have a longer sales cycle, and enable to continue the momentum that we're seeing in OpenStack and OpenShift, and then also from the perspective of coverage, right. Because we do not have -- we've been growing at a great rate, but we still have opportunity in all our geographies to go after new accounts. And it goes back to even the question that we had before. It's great that we have the renewals and we have the upsell, but we also want to make sure that we're going after new accounts. And as we go into FY '17, that's a major focus for us is to go after new accounts. And in order to go after new accounts, you have some investments that you need to make. So a combination of new accounts investment, as well as the expansion of the emerging market. Just earlier today, I was talking with our service -- lead of our services business, and that's another great example as far as the investment we're making in services. Services is kind of a presale for us to get customers on RHEL, or more importantly, to get them on emerging products. And usually, it requires an investment somewhere in the 6- to 9-month time frame. So we're making those kinds of investments, which is going to bring future growth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Weiss (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then if I could sneak one last one in just again coming back to the competitive environment. Just kind of wondering about VMware. They're going through a lot of organizational sort of changes we'll say right now. And any sort of let up in the competitive environment against them or any opportunity given the potential distraction that they're seeing that may be a benefit to you guys right now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, I think a couple of things. I think that a lot of the distraction that's been happening I think makes people really start questioning when vendors change hands, start saying, \"Well, wow, how locked am I -- locked into them am I?\" So I think it does help highlight our value proposition of lack of lock-in. And then, just broadly, as people start thinking about private cloud and scale-out architectures, we have a compelling value proposition and that immediately gets people thinking, \"Well, what about for my statefull [ph] application?\" So RHEV for us, which is our scale-up VMware competitor, has continued to do well as we get in conversations around workloads. So I want to do OpenStack, but if I'm going to do that for scale out, I may as well look at RHEV with a similar technology stack under my scale up workload. So certainly, also the cloud thing is helping us as we talk to customers about long-term, what they want to do with their core virtualization stacks as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nFirst on OpenStack. It feels like the awareness of OpenStack is somewhat greater than the awareness of Red Hat OpenStack. I'm wondering if you would agree with that and what needs to be done there. And also secondly, for you, Frank, the duration adjustment should not really affect your short-term deferred revenue growth, right? And in that regard, do you think that you'd be able to sustain your current top line revenue growth the way your short-term deferred revenue growth has been coming through?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, I'll start on OpenStack, right. So on OpenStack, recognize Red Hat's value proposition is everything we do around productization of open source. So when you put something into production, people turn to Red Hat. So yes, there are a lot of -- even our good customers playing around with OpenStack in the lab and whether that's community or kind of professional services supported stuff. And many of them will say, \"When we put in production, obviously we're going to use Red Hat OpenStack platform.\" So as people start putting things in production, we pick up traction there. So yes, there's a lot of experimentation out there, and that's great because as people get more comfortable with it and get closer to put it in production, they come back to us. And we've seen that already happening with customers. So yes, I mean, we do have a lot of OpenStack out there, which is great because ultimately, again, that should come our way when people put it in production.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nThe other thing going, we've talked about this. I just want to add to Jim's comment about OpenStack. Because as far as the overall community, we have close to 4,000 certified engineers, which is 3x what the number was last year. So we're seeing a lot of momentum. And we believe and more customers that we talk to and more forums that we go to on this whole topic, Red Hat is front and center. So I would kind of really want to emphasize that. As far as the other part of your question, as I mentioned earlier and we've said in the past, if you look at our contract duration, historically, it's been around 21 months, and so it can fluctuate a little higher, a little lower. But 21 months seems to be the historic duration. It's one that we're actually saying is going to be the case as we go into Q4. That 21-month, that duration, that short-term deferred also supports our revenue for the coming years. So I think we're not giving guidance for FY '17, but clearly, our objective would be to help support that type of continuation of a growth rate going forward with the new opportunities, both renewals as well as new customers. And I think that 21 months is a fairly reasonable rate to sustain over a period of time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brent Thill (Analysts)】\nFrank, just back on operating margins. For the last 7 years, you've been in a pretty tight range on op margin. We certainly understand that the growth has been the #1 priority. But is there anything structurally that you see, having gone onboard recently, that makes you believe that -- it just seems with the recurring revenue, the subscription model, that this was coming back at a high margin. What are the big investments now that you see that you need to make that keep these margins in this range? Or do you feel like there's a breakout that could come here profitability with the growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nI don't see -- I haven't seen anything in the 5 months, almost 6 months that I've been here from a structural standpoint that would have to change from that perspective. I think, again, it goes back to what I was saying before, very healthy operating margins, that's been very successful for Red Hat for a number of years. Our objective is to continue to leverage that as best as we can. But we also want to make sure, and I continue to say this, make sure that we're making the investments to help support the growth. I wouldn't want to be in the situation a year from now or 2 years from now trying to struggle to get the growth rate. You have to be keep being ahead of that. So of course, it's always that balance, right. And then I think, Jim, the rest of the management team, myself, that's clearly what we want to do. We want to keep that balance as best we can. But a key priority for us is to help support that growth. It's what our customers are asking for and where we think there's an opportunity for. It goes back to some of the earlier comments that we made about open source and how well it's positioned right now with customers versus some of the proprietary options that have been there in the past. So we want to make sure we can ride that as best as we can.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes, and just keep in mind, the stuff that's growing at 45% year-over-year is newer stuff, and therefore has a higher cost of sale in the short run as we talked about with OpenStack and POCs and OpenShift, et cetera, et cetera. So our business growing in the mid- to high-teens has a lower cost of sales than our business growing at 45%. So there is a mix issue in there that has been inherent for the last several years.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nAnd again, we're going to provide the type of judgment and perspective, as you would expect, as we look at the opportunities and we weigh the investments that we have to make. And we're looking at our business. The other thing I just want to mention is we're looking at our business now more longer term. So we're looking at our business over several years. And so we're looking at investments and the return and the payback we expect to get, as I'm sure most investors would want us to do. So we'll make sure that we balance that in the portfolio.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Ashley (Analysts)】\nI'd like to ask about the go-to-market. And specifically, with OpenShift and the dev side of the house kind of coming up the curve rapidly, you obviously stepped-up your hiring on the direct side. Number one, what are kind of some of the resources you'd need around quota sales reps on that side of the business that you maybe need to train or to bring on to support the growth there? And second, separately, do you need an indirect channel, some partners on the dev side to help drive that business going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell look, I mean, you see we do have a lot of channel business today. What I would say is the good news on OpenShift is it is the same buyer as much of the JBoss portfolio, so we already have relationships on the dev side of the house. And so that same sales force is able to sell OpenShift. So certainly, given that's part of that stuff that's growing at 45%, we're obviously adding a lot of people to service that. So certainly, it's a big chunk of our growth. In terms of channel partners, yes, we definitely have some and we'd like to have more. Again, these are earlier technologies that require a lot of handholding and POCs upfront, which makes them a little less channel-friendly. I think we're very excited about things like OpenShift, the dedicated instances of OpenShift Online. That's something enterprises want and makes it much more channel-ready and easy to sell. So we'll certainly look, as OpenShift kind of gets more mature and with the online Dedicated Instances, at leveraging our channel partners more, which obviously then helps again with just the overall cost of sale.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Walter Pritchard (Analysts)】\nFrank, just a quick one on my end. On the currency impact, could you just give us the impact of currency on the cash or on the balance sheet deferred revenue broken out by short term and long term? I think I either missed it or you didn't give it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nYes. Let me just look for it. Why don't you go to the next question? I'll find it and I'll come back to give that to you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nIt's also in the supplemental metrics that we published. So if you want to find it there as well, but we'll read out from there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nRight. I think it's on the second page of -- yes, Page 10 in the attachment that we sent out. It even has kind of the breakout of the short-term deferred revenue and the long-term deferred revenue.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Wood (Analysts)】\nI wanted to ask about geography. It looks like EMEA and APAC growth have generally been accelerating over the last couple of quarters. And the bookings numbers looked particularly good out of those -- both those regions as well. I was just hoping you could talk about what may be contributing to this pickup and how you'd characterize the demand environment and maybe just some of the dynamics going on out there in terms of open source adoption.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nSo I'll just clarify. So the growth rates from a region perspective, in Americas constant currency, we've provided that now about 19%; EMEA was 25%; Asia-Pac was 23%. So as we said, I mean, we've got some pretty good growth across all the regions, which is great to see. I would say that there's nothing in particular, just going back to the analysis, that would come out that would highlight any difference between any one of the regions. I'm thinking about just the types of deals, the types of emerging products, it's been fairly consistent.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes, there's nothing that comes to mind to me either. I think if any -- North America had such a strong year last year, there might be a little relative comp, but I think...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nNorth America probably, I mean, a little bit more public sector, I would say, but...\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes, yes. I think overall, I'd say it's pretty similar across the world. I don't think there are any regions that are particularly strong or weak. It's been pretty solid across the board.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian White (Analysts)】\nWondering if you could talk a little bit of where we are in this OpenStack movement. There's been a lot of hype around it. It seems like the opportunity is big. But when do you think it's really going to reach an inflection point and start to matter for Red Hat?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nThese things do take a while because this is not -- if you kind of say the big last trend, virtualization, right? Virtualization slid underneath existing workloads. And so we try -- and it was primarily VMware sold in a license model. And you put those things together, it was able to kind of balloon up really, really quick. This is the infrastructure for the next generation of computing. And so it is net new workloads. And as people build scale out workloads, they are highly likely, if they're going to run on prem, to run on OpenStack. And so it will be big, but the relative way in which it will scale over time will just be a more natural ramp. So at some point, in any ramp, there's kind of the S-curve kink up. And is that kink up next year or just beyond? It's hard to exactly say. We're really, really pleased with the customers, the workloads people are putting on it, the experience that people are now having. So at some point, the S-curve will really kind of kink up, but it's hard for me to give you an exact kind of time on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nOne of -- and we are spending a lot of time internally thinking about what types of metrics would be a good indicator that we can then share at some point in the future that would give investors a better sense for some of that traction. So as we continue to look at that, we feel comfortable with certain metrics. We'll try to find a way to share that as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Maguire (Analysts)】\nI wonder if you could comment whether you had any stand-alone emerging products deals and how the Fuse middleware and embedded businesses are tracking.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nFuse.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nWe had a couple of good -- just looking at -- we had -- in the top 30 deals, we had 3 with Fuse, which was pretty consistent with what we've seen in prior quarters. I'm just looking across some of the key deals.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, frankly, the key deal, I will say Fuse has been, I think, a standout performer for us in terms of it's just done, I think, far beyond our expectations when we acquired FuseSource. We're seeing it just all over the place in a number of our customers. So we obviously don't break it out, but it's become a pretty substantial product in the portfolio for us. Sorry, we're also counting as we're talking here. Let's see. One...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nI've got the number here, Jim. Frank's got the number.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nYes, there're 3 here. So that all the -- just [indiscernible] part, 5 in the app related -- app development-related emerging technologies. We had 7 with OpenStack, 5 with OpenShift, 1 with CloudForms, 3 had Fuse, as I said. 7 in Storage, which was very good across the board, and we had 4 with RHEV.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes, how many deals had just emerging or just middleware?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\n5.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\n5 were just -- okay. Yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nSo 5 was yes, outside of RHEL.\n\n---\n\n【質問: S. Kirk Materne (Analysts)】\nGentlemen, I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit about just the adoptions of the emerging technologies outside the U.S. I assume the adoption inside the U.S is probably faster than what you're seeing internationally. I guess is there any sort of lag or anything you could -- and I guess, around that, do you feel like the emerging technologies distribution platform still needs to be built out internationally? Or is it just simply sort of a technology adoption update that you see, U.S. then international?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes, surprisingly, we actually see the emerging technologies doing just as well internationally as we see in the U.S. Especially, OpenShift, OpenStack, I mean, really strong adoption internationally. The only thing that was a downer is it's even harder to find skilled resources in some of these countries, language capabilities, et cetera, et cetera. So internationally, we are very much supply constrained. Eight of our top 30 deals were in EMEA, to give an example. But even on the emerging products, again I've just got back from trips to both Asia and EMEA, and most of those conversations are around containers and dev ops and OpenStack, OpenShift. And so I don't really see any difference, which I agree with you is kind of a bit surprising. We generally think of the U.S. as an early adopter, but it really is strong across the world.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Greg McDowell (Analysts)】\nI would love more of a behind-the-scenes look on how the Microsoft and Red Hat partnership came together. I mean was this a situation where you were courting each other for multiple years and you finally pulled the trigger? Or was it more of a situation where just the dynamics of the infrastructure market was changing so quickly that you decided to tie the knot quickly? And I guess Part B of that question is what sort of milestone should we be tracking with respect to the Microsoft partnership? I mean, what should we -- what metric should we used to judge whether or not the partnership is ultimately a success?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, I'll start. I mean, this took a while for it to come together. There are a lot of complexities around intellectual property and other things that we needed to make sure that we had right that were fully consistent with the GPL and our open source principles, and those things took a while. So no, the discussions have been underway for quite a long time. I think for both of us, we've had a lot of customers pushing us both to do this. A lot of customers, their infrastructure runs on RHEL, and they decided they would like to run that on Azure. And so this was really customer-driven that we ultimately got it done, but it was a -- kind of several quarters' worth of work to actually get it done. We're excited about the results.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Calderoni (Executives)】\nAnd the other thing, as far as the second part, I mean, again, as we mentioned earlier, it's early, having just closed the deal. And now we're making sure that the 2 companies can come together on the key areas. Of course, the first one is to be able to make the offering available to customers and start tracking the customers that actually move on to RHEL on Azure. Secondly, we have an agreement between the 2 companies to co-locate engineers to make sure that we can support some of the customers and make it a much better experience for them. We've already started that, and we've got engineers on both sides. We'll continue to ramp those engineers as necessary, so kind of monitoring their success. Working between 2 companies is always a challenge, but we feel optimistic that we can kind of work to it. The other piece is the .NET. And again, it's early, so we want to see what type of traction that we have on .NET. And then also just explore what other options we have working with Microsoft Azure as far as some of our other products, and that's where I think there's a lot more value. So as we continue to work through this, we'll come up with some metrics. Clearly, we have metrics internally, but ones that I think we can sure use externally to give you some traction or give you some indication of how the traction's working over time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nGreat. And on behalf of everyone here, we want to thank our investors and the analyst community for all the support they've given us this year. We look forward to talking to you all in the next couple of weeks and clearly into next year. Thank you very much for joining us today.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nHappy holidays, everyone.",

With me this morning are Al Monaco, President and CEO; John Whelen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Guy Jarvis, President, Liquids Pipelines; Wanda Opheim, Senior Vice President, Finance; Leigh Kelln, Vice President, Investor Relations and Enterprise Risk; and Chris Johnston, Vice President and Controller.\r\nWith me this morning -- sorry, this call is webcast, and I encourage those listening on the phone lines to view the supporting slides, which are available on our website. A replay and podcast of the call will be available later today, and a transcript will be posted to our website shortly thereafter. The Q&A format will be the same as prior calls. We'll take questions from the analyst community first and then invite questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] I'll also mention that the Investor Relations team will be available after the call for any questions that you might have.\r\nBefore we get started, I'd like to point out that we will refer to forward-looking information in connection with Enbridge and the subject matter of today's call. By its nature, this information contains forecasts, assumptions and expectations about future outcomes, so we remind you it is subject to the risks and uncertainties affecting every business, including ours. This slide includes a summary of the significant factors and risks that could affect future outcomes for Enbridge, which are discussed more fully in our public disclosure filings available on both the SEDAR and EDGAR systems.\r\nI'll now turn the call over to Al Monaco.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everybody. We know there's another event today, so we thank you for joining us. We'll try to be efficient with your time. The slide here just outlines the purpose of the call. I'll begin by talking about the dividend increase that we announced earlier today. I do want to spend a few minutes on how we're uniquely positioned for the current commodity price environment. Yesterday, we finalized next year's budget, so John will take you through how we see 2016 shaping up and our guidance numbers. Then I'll wrap up with our longer-term outlook and then go to Q&A.\r\nSo turning now to Slide 4, the headline today is continued strong dividend growth. As I said earlier this morning, we announced our 21st consecutive annual dividend increase, this one from the current level of $1.86 a share to $2.12 a share for 2016. This 14% increase follows the 33% jump we had last year, so that's a 51% increase in 2 years. And the increase is in line with our DPS range that we laid out for the investment community at Enbridge Days in October.\r\nThe long-term pattern you see here stems from the strong cash-generating capability of our assets and continued investment in the business, about $36 billion over the period that you see here in the chart. And we're confident dividend growth will continue as we execute our $38 billion program over the next 5 years. Now a key to this is that, unlike most of the peer group, we continue to maintain very strong cash flow coverage of the dividend of around 2x throughout the 5-year planning horizon. The strengths of that coverage comes from a few things, and it does a few things for us. It gives us a buffer while we execute the bulk of the $25 billion in secured capital over the next 2 to 3 years, it follows -- it allows us the flexibility to capitalize on new opportunities and, depending on how we see those opportunities, whether they're attractive or not, it provides a scope to accelerate the pace of dividend growth. \r\nTurning now to Slide 5 and why we're confident about our ability to continue this kind of growth in the dividend with the current environment. Over the past year, we've seen significant erosion in midstream valuations for a host of reasons. We've got the downturn in commodity prices, reduced upstream investment in some areas and the expectation of rising interest rates. So the slide here captures the 3 reasons why we believe our business model positions us well in this environment. Number one, we're largely insulated from low commodity prices in the near to medium term. Two, the combination of strong and transparent supply growth and constrained pipe capacity in Western Canada differentiates us from shale-growth-driven businesses. And third, the magnitude of our capital program and the progress in executing the projects means there's a high probability we can continue to grow in this macro trough and then beyond.\r\nLet me take you through each one of these 3 points beginning on Slide 6 with how we're insulated from commodity exposure. So as many of you know, we measure market price risk including commodities through earnings at risk. We manage to below 5%, and it's currently less than 3%. 95% of our cash flows are underpinned by strong commercial constructs. That includes 10- to 25-year long-term take-or-pay contracts on pipes upstream and downstream of the Mainline. It's that supply push and market pull that drives Mainline volumes under our industry CTS agreement. Then we have term contracts on long haul natural gas pipes, and we're under incentivized cost of service on our Gas Distribution utility.\r\nAnother question we often get relates to credit risk. 95% of the revenues are from investment grade companies or equivalent credit enhancement. We've simply not had any credit defaults to speak of, because crude and natural gas, as everybody knows on the call, needs to flow to market. And remember as well that about, I guess, it's 10 Mainline shippers are companies like Exxon, Imperial, Shell and Suncor, so they are the strongest as integrated players in the industry.\r\nLet me come back to how our major supply basin is different from others on Slide 7. First, oil sands reserves has very stable production profiles with 40-plus year lives compared to the super high decline rate shales that need extensive drilling to maintain and grow production. Equally important, oil sands projects in execution are expected to provide 800,000 barrels per day of growth out of Western Canada through 2019.\r\nThe second chart shows that x Alberta pipe capacity, we'll likely be constrained as volumes increase. So the point is even a bearish case, that's the cap operating and under construction case here, the dash black line, there's a 500,000-barrel per day shortage of x Alberta capacity by 2021. And in any scenario, our liquid systems are competitively positioned, because our tolls are the most economical to key markets.\r\nOur systems are also connected to -- connect crude supply directly to refineries and downstream pipes, totaling 3.5 million barrels per day of market demand. Given that production and capacity outlook, our Mainline should be in good shape and full through the next several years. But what this also tells us is that we'll need more capacity if the cap supply forecast, that's the solid black line there, is borne out after 2020 or so. On that point, we think the best way to add new capacity in this environment is through low-cost incremental expansion that minimizes tolls and throughput commitments. You can see we have a number of those opportunities that provide up to 800,000 barrels per day of cross-border capacity.\r\nTurning now to Slide 8 and the third reason for the strength of our positioning in this environment. Our $38 billion capital program will drive strong growth in cash flow, even in a difficult commodity environment. And the reason for that is $25 billion is commercially secured and underpinned by long-term contracts. And as you can see, we've got another $13 billion in development. \r\nThe second chart shows the profile of secured project in execution, which are all planned to be in service before the end of 2018 for the most part. Now as you can see here, $8 billion of this relates to this year. So we can effectively call 1/3 of the $25 billion already executed. The remaining 2/3 is made up primarily of large projects, namely Line 3 replacement, Sandpiper, regional oil sands optimization that will support Fort Hills and Northern Lights [ph], which also supports Fort Hills. Those are all at varying stages of execution and progressing well. So a very strong portfolio of projects that alone will generate the lion's share of the 5-year growth outlook for us. \r\nFinally, a critical element of execution is funding the capital program, especially in this environment. Our approach to funding has been to ensure we can withstand potential capital markets disruption by maintaining a strong balance sheet, more than ample liquidity and by accessing various sources of equity and debt funding, so John is going to cover that in more detail. But given current valuations, we will be assessing all possible sources of lower cost capital.\r\nSo with that, let me turn it over to John to take you through the guidance.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thanks, Al. I'm on Slide 9 now, starting off with our outlook for 2015, which remains very much in line with the update we provided a month ago on our Q3 call. As I noted at that time, we expected adjusted earnings per share for the full year will likely end up in the lower half of our guidance range of $2.05 to $2.35 per share. This is mostly attributable to the long delay in receiving leave to open for the Line 9 reversal and expansion project. And to a degree, from weaker than anticipated results at our Aux Sable processing business. \r\nFor most of this year, these impacts had largely been offset by stronger-than-anticipated performance on our Canadian liquids Mainline. However, as we noted on our last call, we did see some softness in throughput on the Mainline in October, mainly due to disruptions on third-party infrastructure. This included the impact for the fire at an upgrader, longer than anticipated turnarounds at refineries served by our pipes and a disruption at the downstream NGL storage facility.\r\nNow sitting here today, with November behind us and with Mainline nominations in for December, we are comfortable that the issues we saw in October were truly transitory, and throughput on the Mainline is tracking back to where we'd expect it to be. But the nice tailwind we were seeing from the Mainline won't be as big as we thought earlier in the year, and so we're still expecting adjusted EPS to end up in the lower half of our guidance range.\r\nAs for cash flow, based on our most recent projections of maintenance capital incurred in taxes, available cash from operations, or ACFFO per share, is still on track to come close to the middle of our guidance range that we introduced earlier in the year.\r\nSo moving on to guidance for 2016, and this is now on Slide 10. Before I get into the numbers, I want to take a minute and provide some context for how we will be guiding. The very large drop down that we undertook earlier this year resulted in some significant changes to our corporate structure, with the transfer of our largest business, the Canadian Liquids Pipelines business, to Enbridge Income Fund. It also caused us to reassess how we measure business and corporate performance going forward. \r\nIn June, we introduced ACFFO as a new cash flow oriented performance metric and provided some initial guidance for 2015. Then in early October at Enbridge Days, we reviewed our expectations for ACFFO growth over Enbridge's longer-term planning horizon. We've also been looking hard at how best to present and convey the performance of our businesses post the drop-down. And that lead us to a review of our segmented reporting, which has traditionally split out the performance of our sponsored vehicles into a separate segment. This slide illustrates where we have landed -- what we've landed on for presentation in 2016. \r\nStarting with our Q1 2016 results, our reporting segments will transition to an operational view, focusing on the company's 5 major business lines, regardless of how the assets within each business are owned. You can see the new segments set out in the schedule on the top right-hand side of this slide. And you can also see that, at the operating level, the measure we plan to focus on is adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, rather than bottom line earnings. We think this should provide better transparency and insight into the operating performances of our major business lines. \r\nEBIT will also provide a clear and direct link to consolidated ACFFO, which will be the focus of overall performance measurement for the company as a whole in 2016 and beyond. You can see the reconciliation and direct connection to ACFFO on the schedule on the bottom right-hand side of this slide. To be clear, these are changes that we will introduce starting with our first quarter of 2016. Our 2015 year-end results will still be reported using our current segmentation and will focus on adjusted net earnings.\r\nSo with that in mind, let's have a first look at our guidance for 2016. And I'm now on Slide 11. As you can see, we expect consolidated EBIT generated by our businesses will range from $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion. That's on a 100% basis, before taking into account the share of noncontrolling interests. After consideration of financing, tax, maintenance capital costs and amounts payable to the public holders of our Sponsored Vehicles, we expect that our projected EBIT will translate to a bottom line ACFFO of $3.80 to $4.50 per share to the Enbridge Inc. common shareholder. The midpoint of this range translates to very strong year-over-year growth, building upon what is expected to be a very strong growth in 2015.\r\nSo what are the big drivers of year-over-year growth in 2016? Once again, Liquids Pipelines will be the biggest contributor. Mainline volumes will be a significant driver as volume throughput ex Gretna is expected to continue to average close to 2.5 million barrels per day in 2016. Higher volumes are expected to be offset, to some degree, by a lower Canadian residual benchmark toll, as tolls on the Lakehead System are expected to rise. But the Mainline system as a whole will be a very strong driver of year-over-year growth. And of course, we'll finally see the benefits of revenue and cash flow from Line 9, which has been line filling in November and will be in service and generating revenue here in December.\r\nLiquids Pipelines is also expected to generate increased contributions from both Mainline and regional oil sands assets that went into service during 2015, as well as the Southern Access Extension project, which is expected to be completed and in service by the end of 2015. At our Gulf Coast Access Pipelines are also expected to generate higher revenue and cash flow as a result of growing throughput and the anticipated alleviation of the impacts of upstream apportionment on the Mainline.\r\nGas Distribution will also make a solid contribution to year-over-year growth, driven by its growing rate base, which reflects the GTA project coming into service in phases later this year and early next year, as well as another strong year of a customer additions in Ontario, particularly, in and around Toronto. Gas Distribution will also benefit from the cost reductions and operating efficiencies that will be shared with ratepayers under EGD's customized incentive rate mechanism.\r\nGas pipelines and processing will also boost growth in 2016, with the main driver here being a full year of contributions from the new pipelines placed into service on our offshore Gulf of Mexico system. The Big Foot Oil Pipeline and the second phase of the Walker Ridge Gas Gathering System were completed this year and started receiving take-or-pay capacity payments in late 2015.  Partially offsetting the business growth drivers I just highlighted will be higher financing costs reflecting the new capital that we've been raising to fund our growth program and higher distributions to the public investors in our Sponsored Vehicles, which hold a growing interest in Enbridge's overall asset base. So all in all, we see solid growth in 2016, in line with our 5-year strategic plan.\r\nBefore I move on, I'll touch on a couple of other factors on the slide that impact ACFFO per share. We do have some maintenance and activities in 2015 shifting into 2016. And as a result, we expect maintenance capital to be a little higher next year when compared with 2015. It will be somewhere between $800 million and $850 million on an enterprise-wide basis, and current income tax should come in between $100 million and $150 million for the year, which is a good proxy for cash taxes.\r\nSo moving on now to Slide 12. Given all the growth that we do see in front us over the coming year, I also want to spend a moment on how we are positioned from a funding perspective. The main message is that we have plenty of flexibility and continue to enjoy strong and diversified access to private and public capital markets. The left-hand side of this slide summarizes the key entities in markets through which we can raise capital. We showed this at Enbridge Day. The green areas are markets we either have traditionally used or are likely to access in the execution of our funding plan over the next few years. The blue markets, the blue shaded portion are the ones that we see as being potential great sources of incremental capital that we also may wish to access.\r\nIn a bit of a tough equity market like the one we're experiencing today, it's important to remember that we have access to private as well as public capital. For example, we are seeing some good opportunities these days to partner with pension funds and other private equity partners. This is something that we've done opportunistically in the past, and it may make some sense in today's market as a way to optimize our cost of capital.\r\nIt's also important to emphasize that we continue to maintain more than ample liquidity in the form of fully committed bank credit facilities to make sure funds are available when needed to manage through periods of market volatility and meet any unplanned contingencies. As you can see on the slide, we had $9 billion of unutilized liquidity available at the end of November. So again, we're very well positioned from a financing flexibility perspective, having diversified sources of capital to draw upon and plenty of liquidity in reserve.\r\nSo turning now to Slide 13, let me touch briefly on Enbridge Income Fund before turning things back to Al. Earlier this morning, Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc., or ENF, announced a 10% increase to the January 2016 dividend. This is on top of the 10% increase that was announced for the closing of the drop-down of the Canadian Liquids Pipelines business in early September, and it really reinforces the strength of the fund's diversified asset portfolio and the inherent growth now embedded in its portfolio of assets. All in, ENF shareholders will enjoy a 17% increase in annual dividends from 2015 to 2016, after a 14% dividend per share increase from 2014 to 2015. And ENF expects to continue to deliver DPS growth through 2019, 10% annual increases supported by the significant secure growth embedded within its Liquids Pipelines business.\r\nWe've also provided ACFFO guidance for the Fund group. Remember that the Fund group is the combination of Enbridge Income Fund and Enbridge Commercial Trust as well as Enbridge Income Partners LP, which is the partnership through which all of the operating businesses of the fund are held. It's the cash flow generation of this Fund group as a whole that drives distributions to ENF and, ultimately, the dividends that ENF pays to its shareholders.\r\nAs you can see, we're expecting Fund group ACFFO to come in between $1.75 -- pardon me, between $1.75 billion and $2.05 billion in 2016, reflecting strong cash flow growth generated by the fund's base business and new assets coming into service. So with another increase -- dividend increase under its belt and more to come, we think ENF is a very attractive option for investors looking for a high payout and strong and predictable growth from low-risk energy infrastructure.\r\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back over to Al.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thanks, John. To conclude, Slide 14 reiterates our 5-year outlook, which really hasn't changed that much since Enbridge Day. The $38 billion capital program drives out average ACFFO growth of 15% to 18% through 2019. The squiggly arrow here you'll see connecting those first 2 bars shows that the growth profile will be uneven, reflecting the timing of new projects coming into service.\r\nDividend growth is expected to be very strong at 14% to 16% annually over the same period, but that profile should be more linear. Assuming that level of ACFFO growth and dividend growth, we'd expect to be at about 2x dividend coverage on average through 2019. I think that's an important point, because even though we're delivering superior dividend growth, we're not doing it at the expense dividend coverage as we execute our capital program. We think that's a prudent approach and sets us apart from some of our peers. And it gives us a fair amount of flexibility in the latter part of the plan as these growth projects come into service and start generating cash flow.\r\nAnd finally, on to Slide 16. This slide draws out why we believe Enbridge shares at this price provide an even more compelling value proposition than in the past relative to the peer group. First, our 5-year plan is set to provide that 15% to 18% ACFFO growth through 2019 compared to the peer average of 8%. We're confident in that outlook because of the relatively low exposure to commodity prices we discussed, the outlook for Western Canadian production, which is growing, and the magnitude and progress we are making in executing our capital program. So despite the downturn in the sector, cash flow growth is coming.\r\nYou can see that our business model, this on the top right-hand side now, has proven to provide steady and predictable growth over the years. We expect that transparency of rising ACFFO will translate to exceptional dividend growth, 14% to 16%, as we said, versus 8% for the peer group. And even with strong dividend growth, we maintain a conservative coverage at twice that of the peer group. That positions us very well to capitalize on new opportunities or accelerate dividend growth.\r\nSo with that, let's turn it over to the Q&A session.",

So as many of you know, we measure market price risk including commodities through earnings at risk. We manage to below 5%, and it's currently less than 3%. 95% of our cash flows are underpinned by strong commercial constructs. That includes 10- to 25-year long-term take-or-pay contracts on pipes upstream and downstream of the Mainline. It's that supply push and market pull that drives Mainline volumes under our industry CTS agreement.

Equally important, oil sands projects in execution are expected to provide 800,000 barrels per day of growth out of Western Canada through 2019.\r\nThe second chart shows that x Alberta pipe capacity, we'll likely be constrained as volumes increase.

But given current valuations, we will be assessing all possible sources of lower cost capital.\r\nSo with that, let me turn it over to John to take you through the guidance.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: John Whelen (Executives)】\nOkay. Thanks, Al. I'm on Slide 9 now, starting off with our outlook for 2015, which remains very much in line with the update we provided a month ago on our Q3 call. As I noted at that time, we expected adjusted earnings per share for the full year will likely end up in the lower half of our guidance range of $2.05 to $2.35 per share. This is mostly attributable to the long delay in receiving leave to open for the Line 9 reversal and expansion project. And to a degree, from weaker than anticipated results at our Aux Sable processing business. \r\nFor most of this year, these impacts had largely been offset by stronger-than-anticipated performance on our Canadian liquids Mainline. However, as we noted on our last call, we did see some softness in throughput on the Mainline in October, mainly due to disruptions on third-party infrastructure.

But the nice tailwind we were seeing from the Mainline won't be as big as we thought earlier in the year, and so we're still expecting adjusted EPS to end up in the lower half of our guidance range.\r\nAs for cash flow, based on our most recent projections of maintenance capital incurred in taxes, available cash from operations, or ACFFO per share, is still on track to come close to the middle of our guidance range that we introduced earlier in the year.\r\nSo moving on to guidance for 2016, and this is now on Slide 10. Before I get into the numbers, I want to take a minute and provide some context for how we will be guiding. The very large drop down that we undertook earlier this year resulted in some significant changes to our corporate structure, with the transfer of our largest business, the Canadian Liquids Pipelines business, to Enbridge Income Fund. It also caused us to reassess how we measure business and corporate performance going forward. \r\nIn June, we introduced ACFFO as a new cash flow oriented performance metric and provided some initial guidance for 2015. Then in early October at Enbridge Days, we reviewed our expectations for ACFFO growth over Enbridge's longer-term planning horizon. We've also been looking hard at how best to present and convey the performance of our businesses post the drop-down. And that lead us to a review of our segmented reporting, which has traditionally split out the performance of our sponsored vehicles into a separate segment. This slide illustrates where we have landed -- what we've landed on for presentation in 2016. \r\nStarting with our Q1 2016 results, our reporting segments will transition to an operational view, focusing on the company's 5 major business lines, regardless of how the assets within each business are owned. You can see the new segments set out in the schedule on the top right-hand side of this slide. And you can also see that, at the operating level, the measure we plan to focus on is adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, rather than bottom line earnings. We think this should provide better transparency and insight into the operating performances of our major business lines. \r\nEBIT will also provide a clear and direct link to consolidated ACFFO, which will be the focus of overall performance measurement for the company as a whole in 2016 and beyond. You can see the reconciliation and direct connection to ACFFO on the schedule on the bottom right-hand side of this slide. To be clear, these are changes that we will introduce starting with our first quarter of 2016. Our 2015 year-end results will still be reported using our current segmentation and will focus on adjusted net earnings.\r\nSo with that in mind, let's have a first look at our guidance for 2016. And I'm now on Slide 11. As you can see, we expect consolidated EBIT generated by our businesses will range from $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion. That's on a 100% basis, before taking into account the share of noncontrolling interests. After consideration of financing, tax, maintenance capital costs and amounts payable to the public holders of our Sponsored Vehicles, we expect that our projected EBIT will translate to a bottom line ACFFO of $3.80 to $4.50 per share to the Enbridge Inc. common shareholder. The midpoint of this range translates to very strong year-over-year growth, building upon what is expected to be a very strong growth in 2015.\r\nSo what are the big drivers of year-over-year growth in 2016? Once again, Liquids Pipelines will be the biggest contributor. Mainline volumes will be a significant driver as volume throughput ex Gretna is expected to continue to average close to 2.5 million barrels per day in 2016. Higher volumes are expected to be offset, to some degree, by a lower Canadian residual benchmark toll, as tolls on the Lakehead System are expected to rise. But the Mainline system as a whole will be a very strong driver of year-over-year growth. And of course, we'll finally see the benefits of revenue and cash flow from Line 9, which has been line filling in November and will be in service and generating revenue here in December.\r\nLiquids Pipelines is also expected to generate increased contributions from both Mainline and regional oil sands assets that went into service during 2015, as well as the Southern Access Extension project, which is expected to be completed and in service by the end of 2015. At our Gulf Coast Access Pipelines are also expected to generate higher revenue and cash flow as a result of growing throughput and the anticipated alleviation of the impacts of upstream apportionment on the Mainline.\r\nGas Distribution will also make a solid contribution to year-over-year growth, driven by its growing rate base, which reflects the GTA project coming into service in phases later this year and early next year, as well as another strong year of a customer additions in Ontario, particularly, in and around Toronto. Gas Distribution will also benefit from the cost reductions and operating efficiencies that will be shared with ratepayers under EGD's customized incentive rate mechanism.\r\nGas pipelines and processing will also boost growth in 2016, with the main driver here being a full year of contributions from the new pipelines placed into service on our offshore Gulf of Mexico system. The Big Foot Oil Pipeline and the second phase of the Walker Ridge Gas Gathering System were completed this year and started receiving take-or-pay capacity payments in late 2015.  Partially offsetting the business growth drivers I just highlighted will be higher financing costs reflecting the new capital that we've been raising to fund our growth program and higher distributions to the public investors in our Sponsored Vehicles, which hold a growing interest in Enbridge's overall asset base. So all in all, we see solid growth in 2016, in line with our 5-year strategic plan.\r\nBefore I move on, I'll touch on a couple of other factors on the slide that impact ACFFO per share. We do have some maintenance and activities in 2015 shifting into 2016. And as a result, we expect maintenance capital to be a little higher next year when compared with 2015. It will be somewhere between $800 million and $850 million on an enterprise-wide basis, and current income tax should come in between $100 million and $150 million for the year, which is a good proxy for cash taxes.\r\nSo moving on now to Slide 12. Given all the growth that we do see in front us over the coming year, I also want to spend a moment on how we are positioned from a funding perspective. The main message is that we have plenty of flexibility and continue to enjoy strong and diversified access to private and public capital markets. The left-hand side of this slide summarizes the key entities in markets through which we can raise capital. We showed this at Enbridge Day. The green areas are markets we either have traditionally used or are likely to access in the execution of our funding plan over the next few years. The blue markets, the blue shaded portion are the ones that we see as being potential great sources of incremental capital that we also may wish to access.\r\nIn a bit of a tough equity market like the one we're experiencing today, it's important to remember that we have access to private as well as public capital. For example, we are seeing some good opportunities these days to partner with pension funds and other private equity partners. This is something that we've done opportunistically in the past, and it may make some sense in today's market as a way to optimize our cost of capital.\r\nIt's also important to emphasize that we continue to maintain more than ample liquidity in the form of fully committed bank credit facilities to make sure funds are available when needed to manage through periods of market volatility and meet any unplanned contingencies. As you can see on the slide, we had $9 billion of unutilized liquidity available at the end of November. So again, we're very well positioned from a financing flexibility perspective, having diversified sources of capital to draw upon and plenty of liquidity in reserve.\r\nSo turning now to Slide 13, let me touch briefly on Enbridge Income Fund before turning things back to Al. Earlier this morning, Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc., or ENF, announced a 10% increase to the January 2016 dividend. This is on top of the 10% increase that was announced for the closing of the drop-down of the Canadian Liquids Pipelines business in early September, and it really reinforces the strength of the fund's diversified asset portfolio and the inherent growth now embedded in its portfolio of assets. All in, ENF shareholders will enjoy a 17% increase in annual dividends from 2015 to 2016, after a 14% dividend per share increase from 2014 to 2015. And ENF expects to continue to deliver DPS growth through 2019, 10% annual increases supported by the significant secure growth embedded within its Liquids Pipelines business.\r\nWe've also provided ACFFO guidance for the Fund group. Remember that the Fund group is the combination of Enbridge Income Fund and Enbridge Commercial Trust as well as Enbridge Income Partners LP, which is the partnership through which all of the operating businesses of the fund are held. It's the cash flow generation of this Fund group as a whole that drives distributions to ENF and, ultimately, the dividends that ENF pays to its shareholders.\r\nAs you can see, we're expecting Fund group ACFFO to come in between $1.75 -- pardon me, between $1.75 billion and $2.05 billion in 2016, reflecting strong cash flow growth generated by the fund's base business and new assets coming into service. So with another increase -- dividend increase under its belt and more to come, we think ENF is a very attractive option for investors looking for a high payout and strong and predictable growth from low-risk energy infrastructure.\r\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back over to Al.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nOkay. Thanks, John. To conclude, Slide 14 reiterates our 5-year outlook, which really hasn't changed that much since Enbridge Day. The $38 billion capital program drives out average ACFFO growth of 15% to 18% through 2019. The squiggly arrow here you'll see connecting those first 2 bars shows that the growth profile will be uneven, reflecting the timing of new projects coming into service.\r\nDividend growth is expected to be very strong at 14% to 16% annually over the same period, but that profile should be more linear. Assuming that level of ACFFO growth and dividend growth, we'd expect to be at about 2x dividend coverage on average through 2019. I think that's an important point, because even though we're delivering superior dividend growth, we're not doing it at the expense dividend coverage as we execute our capital program. We think that's a prudent approach and sets us apart from some of our peers. And it gives us a fair amount of flexibility in the latter part of the plan as these growth projects come into service and start generating cash flow.\r\nAnd finally, on to Slide 16. This slide draws out why we believe Enbridge shares at this price provide an even more compelling value proposition than in the past relative to the peer group. First, our 5-year plan is set to provide that 15% to 18% ACFFO growth through 2019 compared to the peer average of 8%. We're confident in that outlook because of the relatively low exposure to commodity prices we discussed, the outlook for Western Canadian production, which is growing, and the magnitude and progress we are making in executing our capital program. So despite the downturn in the sector, cash flow growth is coming.\r\nYou can see that our business model, this on the top right-hand side now, has proven to provide steady and predictable growth over the years. We expect that transparency of rising ACFFO will translate to exceptional dividend growth, 14% to 16%, as we said, versus 8% for the peer group. And even with strong dividend growth, we maintain a conservative coverage at twice that of the peer group. That positions us very well to capitalize on new opportunities or accelerate dividend growth.\r\nSo with that, let's turn it over to the Q&A session.",
      "transcript_text3": "I appreciate some of the new disclosure. I'm wondering, just to help us compare, would it be possible to get adjusted EBIT historically, a 2014 actual, a 2015 guidance range? And...\n\n---\n\nLinda...\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nSorry, it's John, Linda. We will be doing that. We don't have it at this particular point, but it's something we will be rolling out and -- on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Starting in Q1 2016, you'll start to see those comparisons as well.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think the plan is to provide an additional information pack that will include that, I guess, just shortly after the beginning of the year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And are you going to be discontinuing EPS disclosure on an adjusted basis or comparable basis?\n\n---\n\nNo. No, we won't, Linda, be discontinuing disclosure. We won't be guiding to EPS going forward, but we certainly will be on a consolidated basis disclosing adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just final question. Appreciate the current income tax guidance for 2016 on Page 11. Can you give us any sense of, beyond 2016, how that might be trending?\n\n---\n\nI think at this stage, probably not. I think that's not a bad estimate for the moment.\n\n---\n\nJust regarding your ex Gretna volume outlook of 2.5 million barrels a day. I'm just wondering, is this assuming any potential for volume declines, conventional volume light declines?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's Guy. So when we look at our volume outlook right now, we're highly confident on the heavy side of the system. And we're, in fact, seeing that we can largely move any barrel at capacity we can make available. We're highly confident in what we're seeing coming out of North Dakota, both on our legacy system over into Clearbrook and on our BPAP system up into Cromer. So that's all looking good. The one area that we are watching very closely is exactly the one you've raised, which is on the light side. So we've been watching that for a while, and already we're working on mitigation plans that our system offers us, again, in terms of trying to find a way if those lighter volumes are weak to come up with a crude slate that would allow us to utilize some of the heavies and put it into one of the light lines to kind of beef up the volumes if the lights happen to come in a little bit shorter. Having said that, our outlook for December, now that Line 9 is in service and Southern Access Extension is on its way, is quite strong on light. So we're feeling very good about what we see here in December.\n\n---\n\nAnd I think that slide that we showed that shows the Western Canadian outlook, that's a -- that does include the conventional. So I guess, it's all baked in there, Rob.\n\n---\n\nAll right. And maybe just one follow-up. Regarding your comments on potential partnering with pension funds or private equity partners, is there a particular part of the business that you're looking at this? I'm just wondering, specifically, could we see this as a potential funding mechanism for ENF?\n\n---\n\nIt could be a funding mechanism -- it's John, again, Robert, anywhere in our organization, potentially. We've got lots of great operating businesses and lots of great assets which are very attractive right now to pension funds and private equity investors. So it presents an alternative, not the only alternative, by any means. But it does present another alternative for us with which we can raise capital on what we think could be cost-effective terms.\n\n---\n\nAnd I think it is widely applied, Rob, because I think the real driver there is the nature of the underpinnings to the assets that we have, which in a lot of cases, have long-term contracts behind them, which -- that's really what the alignment is between ourselves and the pension fund. So it could happen in various places.\n\n---\n\nJust wondering, as said in the guidance what -- or inclusive in the guidance, what types of funding, just on the equity side, when you look at all products? What have you included in there? And then just as you look forward, you've mentioned a lot of the different funding options. Are you able to order the attractiveness that sits today in terms of what you probably would attack first?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think we will continue, as we always do, Robert, to look at all of those sources of funding at the end of the day. We do have great access to public markets, we know and reconfirmed all the time that we have good access to other sources of structured financing and so on. We don't like our share price where it is particularly right now. We think there's an awful lot more value in it than there is. But we're a pretty resilient company, at the end of the day, in terms of how we can drive out growth. So we'll continue to look at going to the most effective means. I don't think I'd put them in a specific pecking order right now other than we'll evaluate and make the call at the time as to what the best way to go is.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Maybe just more specifically, just with where the ENF share price is right now, does guidance embed ENF continuing to issue equity along the plan that you've set out? Or are you guys looking at something different?\n\n---\n\nNo. Our guidance assumes normal course. Normal corresponding according to plan doesn't mean we won't look at other things, but our guidance always embeds probably a conservative approach to how we raise the capital at the end of the day. So we're getting what we think is a conservative estimate.\n\n---\n\nOkay. If I can just ask a higher level question as it relates to M&A. And John, you mentioned you don't like where your share price is right now. I don't know how you guys feel, but it feels like you're not getting credit for the very strong growth rates that you've got compared to the peers and some of the rest of the things that you laid out earlier. When you've looked at corporate M&A or larger M&A, you've had the approach of wanting the near-term/immediate accretion and long-term accretion. Have those parameters changed, or are you thinking about it just with some of the depressed share prices you're seeing in the U.S. the ability to maybe loosen up those parameters if you can find something that maybe established a platform very accretive to the long-term growth rate, but maybe puts a little bit of pressure in the near term?\n\n---\n\nWell, it's a very good question, Robert, but obviously tough to be definitive about it. It will really depend. What I would say is, yes, we've always focused on accretion throughout. But at the end of the day, it is cash flow that's going to drive the business. And if we're doing our job properly, we're balancing out all of those things. So I think your point is right. We're going to look at all of the aspects of potential mergers and acquisitions opportunities. Typically, we've been focused on organic growth. And that's, let's call it, an easier assessment than M&A. But as we look at those opportunities out there, we'll take into account the strategic benefit that it does give us. So for example, we've talked about increasing our natural gas footprint. That would be one element in the long term we'd look at, whether or not it does that. Certainly, at the end of the day, is it going to be accretive or dilutive to growth at Enbridge. One issue that we've always had is that usually when you put us together with some of the other parties out there that you would think of, it's not going to necessarily help our overall growth rate. So that's another element that we look at. We'd look at whether or not the cash flow projections are going to drive out positive outcomes relative to what we think our embedded hurdle rate is for our equity. So I think what you pointed out is right, the near-term accretion is one element of it. And I think we'd look at everything in that list that I described.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I guess, just historically -- maybe I misunderstood the way you might have been looking historically. But the sense I had is that there really wasn't much of an appetite to take any material near-term dilution, even if it was better kind of over the medium to longer term. Just wondering if directionally that might have loosened up as we look at the opportunities right now and as well as the outlook, just given the energy prices?\n\n---\n\nAgain, it will depend on what the opportunity is. I wouldn't say that in the past we just wouldn't have done anything that would have created near-term dilution. That's not our preference. But obviously, you can't just look at one metric. And so I would say, frankly, we've always looked at it that way. We prefer not to take near-term dilution, but we really -- if we're doing our job right, we have to look at all of the factors, not just the one.\n\n---\n\nYou've touched on my questions here, but I just wanted a little bit more color on the possibility of private equity and what assets in Enbridge entities that might be more appropriate for. It sounded like in your previous responses, you've indicated that assets that are more suitable to pension funds might be the way to go. So that sounds like lower risk assets. And I'm just wondering if there's any view to maybe using private equity for some of the U.S. under these.\n\n---\n\n;\r\nI think, Robert, that we're looking at a number of different avenues. And it will all come down, at the end of the day, to cost of capital and the overall effectiveness of the cost of capital for the Enbridge Group. In terms of where in the organization, I think my answer earlier was there's a number different places we could use it. We could use it within the fund. We can certainly use it with -- in Enbridge. We could potentially use it with -- in the Enbridge Energy Partners structure as well. So there's multiple applications. It really comes down to making sure that the structures make sense at the end of the day for Enbridge. We have a number of different ways we can go in terms of financing this. So it really all comes down to a flexibility and cost of capital assessment for each area.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And my next question is just on the dividend growth rate. I kind of hate to even ask the question because it's not material to the dividend, but maybe a little bit to perception. In the past, you smoothed the dividend growth rate to sort of middle of the range. And the 14% to 16% growth range over the long term is still intact, but you've raised the dividend 14% this year, despite your obviously strong metrics, including your payout ratio, so recognizing it wouldn't have had a material impact on the 2016 dividend, given your metrics and your outlook, why would you not just have smoothed the dividend growth rate to the middle of the range?\n\n---\n\nQuite frankly, I think it's just a matter of getting comfortable with where we were in terms of total payout, the outlook and so on. I wouldn't read too much into that, quite frankly, Robert, in terms of where we are overall. We think probably that the dividend is in probably in line with where our expectations are. We do have a big Growth Capital Program coming up. And some of that capital has shifted out a little bit over time. And so it's always good to save a little bit in the kitty [ph]. But at the end of the day, I don't think there's anything material that you can intuit from that increase versus our longer-term guidance range.\n\n---\n\nNo, I agree with you. I was just curious on the choice.\n\n---\n\nCan you give us a little sense of what the actual capital budget is for '16? I know you've got a lot coming in service in '17 but only about $1.5 billion this year. So just the path of CapEx. And if it possible, that split between ENB, the Fund and EEP.\n\n---\n\nI can give it to you on a consolidated basis right off the top, Ted, and it's around $9 billion in aggregate. I think I'd have to get back to you on the exact split between the entities.\n\n---\n\nAnd what does that assume in terms of permitting on some of the bigger projects?\n\n---\n\nI don't know. Guy, you could maybe comment on that.\n\n---\n\nWhy, I think the assumption behind that would be the in-service dates that we've been including in our MD&A. So there's no updates since our Q3 MD&A on any of those in-service dates.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Fair enough. And then just on Line 9, where are we on the flows there?\n\n---\n\nWell, Line 9, the line fill is underway. The pipeline is \"in operation.\" Due to the sensitive nature of what our customers are doing on the pipeline, we're not really going to say too much more than that, other than the customers now have the full ability to utilize their contracts as they choose to.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then if I could just ask one more philosophical question. A lot of coverage at the ENB level. But the Fund level, where do you want to run coverage there?\n\n---\n\nWell, at the Fund level, Ted, we look to pay out over the longer term, and I'm talking about the fund assets themselves now, around 90%. And we'll be light of that this year. So 1.1, 1.2x would be typical range of coverage at the Funds level with its distributions up to Enbridge and its distributions up to ENF, the publicly traded vehicle.\n\n---\n\nOn the ACFFO guidance for next year, the range in absolute dollars is about $0.5 billion range from the bottom to the top end of the range. So I'm just wondering, what are the major swing factors that could move you around within that range?\n\n---\n\nPaul, it's -- primarily, you've got some movement in throughput on the Mainline being one of the major factors that would swing things. A little bit of exposure on the FX side will swing things as well, because we're not 100% hedged there. And of course, we do get a significant portion of our revenue and earnings in U.S. Dollars. And a very modest amount coming through on -- from commodity prices indirectly through our interest in the mid-coast business down in the U.S. And to some degree, the amount of arbitrage opportunity that we have available in the energy services business will fluctuate. It's not necessarily directly correlated with whether prices are going up or going down, more with what location, quality differentials and so on and so forth. So those are things that can, frankly, swing the numbers around a little bit more than anything else.\n\n---\n\nOkay. John, you alluded to a lower -- a residual benchmark toll in 2016. Can you give us an order of magnitude of how much lower it goes for Enbridge?\n\n---\n\n;\r\nIt's down -- I can't really comment specifically on that. It is down a little bit. Some of that is transitory, just to be very clear. It relates to catching up for movement in the Lakehead toll at the end of the day. So it's a bit of a -- there's an element of a short-term phenomena in that.\n\n---\n\nAnd would that be implemented on April 1, or is that the July 1 update?\n\n---\n\nApril 1.\n\n---\n\nAnd lastly, on the maintenance CapEx guidance, you gave, the $800 million to $850 million. You mentioned it was down, I think, from -- up from [indiscernible]. Can you give us the 2015 numbers? And then also, can you give us the breakdown by segment? Where is the bulk of the maintenance CapEx spend by segment?\n\n---\n\nYes. I don't have the breakdown right here on maintenance CapEx by segment. We can probably follow up with you on that, Paul. I mean, we have a little bit of a deferral of some of the '15 program into '16, which is affecting our overall estimates for the year, but it should come in within those broad guidelines. Yes, the bulk, to Al's point here, the bulk is always going to be in the liquids business, given the relative size of the business.\n\n---\n\nRight. And what is 2015 targeted at?\n\n---\n\nSo 2015 or 2016, Paul? Sorry.\n\n---\n\nNo, 2015 for the baseline.\n\n---\n\nYes. Just a bit lower than what we expected.\n\n---\n\nSorry, what was that expectation?\n\n---\n\nThe $800 million to $850 million.\n\n---\n\nI guess, the question is for John, just to start off with. And you're halfway through your consolidated liquidity as far as your lines go at this stage and obviously, you've got $9 billion available. But how do you think about your debt funding schedule just coming up and hitting the market and just sort of size, tenor, all of those things, if you could?\n\n---\n\nWell, we have issuance to do across -- as you know, we issue out of multiple different vehicles, and we have issuance to do across the board. We'll look at the liquid tenors primarily, Andrew, which we would do. That's where the biggest appetite is. I think -- we were just discussing this yesterday with our board. I think it's a pretty manageable plan at the end of the day, given appetite we see for our debt capital across the group. So 5s, 10s longs will be the primary place that we'll raise debt capital. And we'll be doing so when market windows are attractive throughout the year. Again, looking at public markets but also looking at private markets, if we would need to.\n\n---\n\nSo more of the same from what you've done in the past?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, again, we'll look at other ways to crack the nut. We always do that as well. But there'll be lots of. There'll be a variety of different markets that we'll look to tap through that period [ph].\n\n---\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Then maybe just a broader question on carbon and, obviously, with what's happening at Paris and what happened at Alberta last week. Obviously, climate is a hugely topical issue. How do any of the proposals, whether out of Alberta specifically or potentially things coming out of the federal government following Paris affect guidance or affect your expectations for carbon taxes or any kind of impact in your numbers. Is that in at this stage or not yet?\n\n---\n\nWell, I guess, the answer, Andrew, is that it's in. But the reality is, just based on where the caps are that were announced for oil sands production and so forth, there's really not going to be any impact through our guidance period the way we see it. So that's on the volume side. And so I think, overall, I would say there's not going to be any impact to us in this near term.\n\n---\n\nYou've put $8 billion of $25 billion secured into service, and that leaves $13 billion, plus you've got another $13 billion unsecured. So could you please comment on the nature of that $13 billion in unsecured projects as these would double your capital needs over the next 3 years?\n\n---\n\nWell, let me handle the first part, Steven. That $13 billion is -- well, first of all, it's a risked amount of capital. That means that there's a number of projects that we probability weight, I guess. You'd say that come down to the $13 million that we estimate. And we do that so that, from a funding perspective, we're planning to succeed on that number of projects. They cover the gambit across all of our enterprises. Probably in the past, that would have been more weighted to Liquids Pipelines. You're probably seeing a balance these days throughout all of the business units within that $13 billion. So that's how we look at that bucket.\n\n---\n\nMy second question is for John. Would we be seeing the waterfall funding table again?\n\n---\n\nI think, we'll periodically introduce the waterfall funding table as we look to update our financing progress. As you know, that's a long-term outlook across multiple vehicles and entities. So I'm not sure it'll be a regular feature of every quarterly call, but it is something that we will update on periodically to give you a feel for the kind of -- both the kind of progress we're making but also the capacity that we have to raise capital throughout the group. So it's not disappearing, but we won't necessarily see it every quarter. And maybe just a quick follow-up for the question that came in earlier, I think it was from Paul on maintenance capital. Probably think $700 million to $750 million for 2015, somewhat lower than our run rate, if you will, for the reasons we said before.\n\n---\n\nI have 2 questions, actually. Mainline volumes nominations for December, how does that look, please?\n\n---\n\nMainline volume nominations are very strong. If -- assuming everything hangs together in terms of the supply making its way into the pipe and our downstream customers running well, we'll be achieving a new record throughput in December.\n\n---\n\nAnd the next question that I had is, what are the likely implications of this tanker ban that's been talked about? Would you -- how do you see it? Is there any chance of you considering some other place rather than Kitimat?\n\n---\n\nOkay. It's Al, I think it's pretty early to speculate on what's going to happen there. I think the new federal government has been in office for about a month, I guess. One thing I would say is that we've heard the Prime Minister and the Minister of Natural Resources indicate their openness to listen. They've talked about the importance of Canada securing markets. So all we can say at this point is we're looking forward to engaging with the federal staff on this. And in the meantime, though, we're going to still focus on what we've been doing since we got the approval for the project, their certificate, at least, which is to focus continued discussions on First Nations consultation. And as a reminder, we also have 28 Aboriginal equity partners that are keen to invest in the project alongside us. So we'll be working with them as well to continue to discuss the project. And hopefully, we'll have some good discussions with all levels of government.\n\n---\n\nAnother Gateway question. I'm just wondering how long you think it will be before Enbridge is able to decide one way or the other whether to actually go ahead and what factors you'll be looking for, aside from the Aboriginal consultation, before you're ready to make that FID?\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, we're not going to be specific on timing. And the reason for that, Lauren, is in this environment and certainly the way we're looking at the business today, we want to make sure that we're taking the time we need not just with First Nations, as you point out, but with governments, particularly in BC and communities. So we're in the mode of making sure that people understand the project. I think that's the main driver. As Guy will tell you, the production profile of the basin under current commodity prices is obviously a little bit lower than it has been in the past. So we feel pretty good about our Mainline capability and serving the needs of customers in the next little while here. So in a way, the timing isn't too concerning to us. We continue to work on the things we need to as far as communities, First Nations and governments.\n\n---\n\nIs it something that might be feasible in 2016, do you think, or are you thinking past that point?\n\n---\n\nYou're referring to with respect to concluding on whether there's a need, or are you talking about making a final investment decision?\n\n---\n\nAn FID on Gateway.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That's possible. I would say, at this point, it's probably going to be in the latter half of 2016, if I had to make a guess.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Hilda. We have nothing further to add at this time. But I'd like to remind you that the Investor Relations team will be available for any follow-up questions that you might have. And once again, thanks for joining us this morning, and have a good day.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Linda Ezergailis (Analysts)】\nI appreciate some of the new disclosure. I'm wondering, just to help us compare, would it be possible to get adjusted EBIT historically, a 2014 actual, a 2015 guidance range? And...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nLinda...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Linda Ezergailis (Analysts)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nSorry, it's John, Linda. We will be doing that. We don't have it at this particular point, but it's something we will be rolling out and -- on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Starting in Q1 2016, you'll start to see those comparisons as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nYes. I think the plan is to provide an additional information pack that will include that, I guess, just shortly after the beginning of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Linda Ezergailis (Analysts)】\nOkay. And are you going to be discontinuing EPS disclosure on an adjusted basis or comparable basis?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nNo. No, we won't, Linda, be discontinuing disclosure. We won't be guiding to EPS going forward, but we certainly will be on a consolidated basis disclosing adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Linda Ezergailis (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just final question. Appreciate the current income tax guidance for 2016 on Page 11. Can you give us any sense of, beyond 2016, how that might be trending?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nI think at this stage, probably not. I think that's not a bad estimate for the moment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Hope (Analysts)】\nJust regarding your ex Gretna volume outlook of 2.5 million barrels a day. I'm just wondering, is this assuming any potential for volume declines, conventional volume light declines?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Guy Jarvis (Executives)】\nYes, it's Guy. So when we look at our volume outlook right now, we're highly confident on the heavy side of the system. And we're, in fact, seeing that we can largely move any barrel at capacity we can make available. We're highly confident in what we're seeing coming out of North Dakota, both on our legacy system over into Clearbrook and on our BPAP system up into Cromer. So that's all looking good. The one area that we are watching very closely is exactly the one you've raised, which is on the light side. So we've been watching that for a while, and already we're working on mitigation plans that our system offers us, again, in terms of trying to find a way if those lighter volumes are weak to come up with a crude slate that would allow us to utilize some of the heavies and put it into one of the light lines to kind of beef up the volumes if the lights happen to come in a little bit shorter. Having said that, our outlook for December, now that Line 9 is in service and Southern Access Extension is on its way, is quite strong on light. So we're feeling very good about what we see here in December.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nAnd I think that slide that we showed that shows the Western Canadian outlook, that's a -- that does include the conventional. So I guess, it's all baked in there, Rob.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Hope (Analysts)】\nAll right. And maybe just one follow-up. Regarding your comments on potential partnering with pension funds or private equity partners, is there a particular part of the business that you're looking at this? I'm just wondering, specifically, could we see this as a potential funding mechanism for ENF?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nIt could be a funding mechanism -- it's John, again, Robert, anywhere in our organization, potentially. We've got lots of great operating businesses and lots of great assets which are very attractive right now to pension funds and private equity investors. So it presents an alternative, not the only alternative, by any means. But it does present another alternative for us with which we can raise capital on what we think could be cost-effective terms.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nAnd I think it is widely applied, Rob, because I think the real driver there is the nature of the underpinnings to the assets that we have, which in a lot of cases, have long-term contracts behind them, which -- that's really what the alignment is between ourselves and the pension fund. So it could happen in various places.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Kwan (Analysts)】\nJust wondering, as said in the guidance what -- or inclusive in the guidance, what types of funding, just on the equity side, when you look at all products? What have you included in there? And then just as you look forward, you've mentioned a lot of the different funding options. Are you able to order the attractiveness that sits today in terms of what you probably would attack first?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nWell, I think we will continue, as we always do, Robert, to look at all of those sources of funding at the end of the day. We do have great access to public markets, we know and reconfirmed all the time that we have good access to other sources of structured financing and so on. We don't like our share price where it is particularly right now. We think there's an awful lot more value in it than there is. But we're a pretty resilient company, at the end of the day, in terms of how we can drive out growth. So we'll continue to look at going to the most effective means. I don't think I'd put them in a specific pecking order right now other than we'll evaluate and make the call at the time as to what the best way to go is.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Kwan (Analysts)】\nOkay. Maybe just more specifically, just with where the ENF share price is right now, does guidance embed ENF continuing to issue equity along the plan that you've set out? Or are you guys looking at something different?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nNo. Our guidance assumes normal course. Normal corresponding according to plan doesn't mean we won't look at other things, but our guidance always embeds probably a conservative approach to how we raise the capital at the end of the day. So we're getting what we think is a conservative estimate.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Kwan (Analysts)】\nOkay. If I can just ask a higher level question as it relates to M&A. And John, you mentioned you don't like where your share price is right now. I don't know how you guys feel, but it feels like you're not getting credit for the very strong growth rates that you've got compared to the peers and some of the rest of the things that you laid out earlier. When you've looked at corporate M&A or larger M&A, you've had the approach of wanting the near-term/immediate accretion and long-term accretion. Have those parameters changed, or are you thinking about it just with some of the depressed share prices you're seeing in the U.S. the ability to maybe loosen up those parameters if you can find something that maybe established a platform very accretive to the long-term growth rate, but maybe puts a little bit of pressure in the near term?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nWell, it's a very good question, Robert, but obviously tough to be definitive about it. It will really depend. What I would say is, yes, we've always focused on accretion throughout. But at the end of the day, it is cash flow that's going to drive the business. And if we're doing our job properly, we're balancing out all of those things. So I think your point is right. We're going to look at all of the aspects of potential mergers and acquisitions opportunities. Typically, we've been focused on organic growth. And that's, let's call it, an easier assessment than M&A. But as we look at those opportunities out there, we'll take into account the strategic benefit that it does give us. So for example, we've talked about increasing our natural gas footprint. That would be one element in the long term we'd look at, whether or not it does that. Certainly, at the end of the day, is it going to be accretive or dilutive to growth at Enbridge. One issue that we've always had is that usually when you put us together with some of the other parties out there that you would think of, it's not going to necessarily help our overall growth rate. So that's another element that we look at. We'd look at whether or not the cash flow projections are going to drive out positive outcomes relative to what we think our embedded hurdle rate is for our equity. So I think what you pointed out is right, the near-term accretion is one element of it. And I think we'd look at everything in that list that I described.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Kwan (Analysts)】\nOkay. I guess, just historically -- maybe I misunderstood the way you might have been looking historically. But the sense I had is that there really wasn't much of an appetite to take any material near-term dilution, even if it was better kind of over the medium to longer term. Just wondering if directionally that might have loosened up as we look at the opportunities right now and as well as the outlook, just given the energy prices?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nAgain, it will depend on what the opportunity is. I wouldn't say that in the past we just wouldn't have done anything that would have created near-term dilution. That's not our preference. But obviously, you can't just look at one metric. And so I would say, frankly, we've always looked at it that way. We prefer not to take near-term dilution, but we really -- if we're doing our job right, we have to look at all of the factors, not just the one.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Catellier (Analysts)】\nYou've touched on my questions here, but I just wanted a little bit more color on the possibility of private equity and what assets in Enbridge entities that might be more appropriate for. It sounded like in your previous responses, you've indicated that assets that are more suitable to pension funds might be the way to go. So that sounds like lower risk assets. And I'm just wondering if there's any view to maybe using private equity for some of the U.S. under these.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\n;\r\nI think, Robert, that we're looking at a number of different avenues. And it will all come down, at the end of the day, to cost of capital and the overall effectiveness of the cost of capital for the Enbridge Group. In terms of where in the organization, I think my answer earlier was there's a number different places we could use it. We could use it within the fund. We can certainly use it with -- in Enbridge. We could potentially use it with -- in the Enbridge Energy Partners structure as well. So there's multiple applications. It really comes down to making sure that the structures make sense at the end of the day for Enbridge. We have a number of different ways we can go in terms of financing this. So it really all comes down to a flexibility and cost of capital assessment for each area.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Catellier (Analysts)】\nOkay. And my next question is just on the dividend growth rate. I kind of hate to even ask the question because it's not material to the dividend, but maybe a little bit to perception. In the past, you smoothed the dividend growth rate to sort of middle of the range. And the 14% to 16% growth range over the long term is still intact, but you've raised the dividend 14% this year, despite your obviously strong metrics, including your payout ratio, so recognizing it wouldn't have had a material impact on the 2016 dividend, given your metrics and your outlook, why would you not just have smoothed the dividend growth rate to the middle of the range?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nQuite frankly, I think it's just a matter of getting comfortable with where we were in terms of total payout, the outlook and so on. I wouldn't read too much into that, quite frankly, Robert, in terms of where we are overall. We think probably that the dividend is in probably in line with where our expectations are. We do have a big Growth Capital Program coming up. And some of that capital has shifted out a little bit over time. And so it's always good to save a little bit in the kitty [ph]. But at the end of the day, I don't think there's anything material that you can intuit from that increase versus our longer-term guidance range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Catellier (Analysts)】\nNo, I agree with you. I was just curious on the choice.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Theodore Durbin (Analysts)】\nCan you give us a little sense of what the actual capital budget is for '16? I know you've got a lot coming in service in '17 but only about $1.5 billion this year. So just the path of CapEx. And if it possible, that split between ENB, the Fund and EEP.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nI can give it to you on a consolidated basis right off the top, Ted, and it's around $9 billion in aggregate. I think I'd have to get back to you on the exact split between the entities.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Theodore Durbin (Analysts)】\nAnd what does that assume in terms of permitting on some of the bigger projects?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nI don't know. Guy, you could maybe comment on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Guy Jarvis (Executives)】\nWhy, I think the assumption behind that would be the in-service dates that we've been including in our MD&A. So there's no updates since our Q3 MD&A on any of those in-service dates.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Theodore Durbin (Analysts)】\nOkay. Fair enough. And then just on Line 9, where are we on the flows there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Guy Jarvis (Executives)】\nWell, Line 9, the line fill is underway. The pipeline is \"in operation.\" Due to the sensitive nature of what our customers are doing on the pipeline, we're not really going to say too much more than that, other than the customers now have the full ability to utilize their contracts as they choose to.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Theodore Durbin (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then if I could just ask one more philosophical question. A lot of coverage at the ENB level. But the Fund level, where do you want to run coverage there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nWell, at the Fund level, Ted, we look to pay out over the longer term, and I'm talking about the fund assets themselves now, around 90%. And we'll be light of that this year. So 1.1, 1.2x would be typical range of coverage at the Funds level with its distributions up to Enbridge and its distributions up to ENF, the publicly traded vehicle.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Lechem (Analysts)】\nOn the ACFFO guidance for next year, the range in absolute dollars is about $0.5 billion range from the bottom to the top end of the range. So I'm just wondering, what are the major swing factors that could move you around within that range?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nPaul, it's -- primarily, you've got some movement in throughput on the Mainline being one of the major factors that would swing things. A little bit of exposure on the FX side will swing things as well, because we're not 100% hedged there. And of course, we do get a significant portion of our revenue and earnings in U.S. Dollars. And a very modest amount coming through on -- from commodity prices indirectly through our interest in the mid-coast business down in the U.S. And to some degree, the amount of arbitrage opportunity that we have available in the energy services business will fluctuate. It's not necessarily directly correlated with whether prices are going up or going down, more with what location, quality differentials and so on and so forth. So those are things that can, frankly, swing the numbers around a little bit more than anything else.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Lechem (Analysts)】\nOkay. John, you alluded to a lower -- a residual benchmark toll in 2016. Can you give us an order of magnitude of how much lower it goes for Enbridge?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\n;\r\nIt's down -- I can't really comment specifically on that. It is down a little bit. Some of that is transitory, just to be very clear. It relates to catching up for movement in the Lakehead toll at the end of the day. So it's a bit of a -- there's an element of a short-term phenomena in that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Lechem (Analysts)】\nAnd would that be implemented on April 1, or is that the July 1 update?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nApril 1.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Lechem (Analysts)】\nAnd lastly, on the maintenance CapEx guidance, you gave, the $800 million to $850 million. You mentioned it was down, I think, from -- up from [indiscernible]. Can you give us the 2015 numbers? And then also, can you give us the breakdown by segment? Where is the bulk of the maintenance CapEx spend by segment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nYes. I don't have the breakdown right here on maintenance CapEx by segment. We can probably follow up with you on that, Paul. I mean, we have a little bit of a deferral of some of the '15 program into '16, which is affecting our overall estimates for the year, but it should come in within those broad guidelines. Yes, the bulk, to Al's point here, the bulk is always going to be in the liquids business, given the relative size of the business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Lechem (Analysts)】\nRight. And what is 2015 targeted at?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nSo 2015 or 2016, Paul? Sorry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Lechem (Analysts)】\nNo, 2015 for the baseline.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nYes. Just a bit lower than what we expected.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Lechem (Analysts)】\nSorry, what was that expectation?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nThe $800 million to $850 million.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Kuske (Analysts)】\nI guess, the question is for John, just to start off with. And you're halfway through your consolidated liquidity as far as your lines go at this stage and obviously, you've got $9 billion available. But how do you think about your debt funding schedule just coming up and hitting the market and just sort of size, tenor, all of those things, if you could?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nWell, we have issuance to do across -- as you know, we issue out of multiple different vehicles, and we have issuance to do across the board. We'll look at the liquid tenors primarily, Andrew, which we would do. That's where the biggest appetite is. I think -- we were just discussing this yesterday with our board. I think it's a pretty manageable plan at the end of the day, given appetite we see for our debt capital across the group. So 5s, 10s longs will be the primary place that we'll raise debt capital. And we'll be doing so when market windows are attractive throughout the year. Again, looking at public markets but also looking at private markets, if we would need to.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Kuske (Analysts)】\nSo more of the same from what you've done in the past?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, again, we'll look at other ways to crack the nut. We always do that as well. But there'll be lots of. There'll be a variety of different markets that we'll look to tap through that period [ph].\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Kuske (Analysts)】\nOkay. That's helpful. Then maybe just a broader question on carbon and, obviously, with what's happening at Paris and what happened at Alberta last week. Obviously, climate is a hugely topical issue. How do any of the proposals, whether out of Alberta specifically or potentially things coming out of the federal government following Paris affect guidance or affect your expectations for carbon taxes or any kind of impact in your numbers. Is that in at this stage or not yet?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nWell, I guess, the answer, Andrew, is that it's in. But the reality is, just based on where the caps are that were announced for oil sands production and so forth, there's really not going to be any impact through our guidance period the way we see it. So that's on the volume side. And so I think, overall, I would say there's not going to be any impact to us in this near term.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Paget (Analysts)】\nYou've put $8 billion of $25 billion secured into service, and that leaves $13 billion, plus you've got another $13 billion unsecured. So could you please comment on the nature of that $13 billion in unsecured projects as these would double your capital needs over the next 3 years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nWell, let me handle the first part, Steven. That $13 billion is -- well, first of all, it's a risked amount of capital. That means that there's a number of projects that we probability weight, I guess. You'd say that come down to the $13 million that we estimate. And we do that so that, from a funding perspective, we're planning to succeed on that number of projects. They cover the gambit across all of our enterprises. Probably in the past, that would have been more weighted to Liquids Pipelines. You're probably seeing a balance these days throughout all of the business units within that $13 billion. So that's how we look at that bucket.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Paget (Analysts)】\nMy second question is for John. Would we be seeing the waterfall funding table again?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Whelen (Executives)】\nI think, we'll periodically introduce the waterfall funding table as we look to update our financing progress. As you know, that's a long-term outlook across multiple vehicles and entities. So I'm not sure it'll be a regular feature of every quarterly call, but it is something that we will update on periodically to give you a feel for the kind of -- both the kind of progress we're making but also the capacity that we have to raise capital throughout the group. So it's not disappearing, but we won't necessarily see it every quarter. And maybe just a quick follow-up for the question that came in earlier, I think it was from Paul on maintenance capital. Probably think $700 million to $750 million for 2015, somewhat lower than our run rate, if you will, for the reasons we said before.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ashok Dutta (Attendees)】\nI have 2 questions, actually. Mainline volumes nominations for December, how does that look, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nMainline volume nominations are very strong. If -- assuming everything hangs together in terms of the supply making its way into the pipe and our downstream customers running well, we'll be achieving a new record throughput in December.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ashok Dutta (Attendees)】\nAnd the next question that I had is, what are the likely implications of this tanker ban that's been talked about? Would you -- how do you see it? Is there any chance of you considering some other place rather than Kitimat?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nOkay. It's Al, I think it's pretty early to speculate on what's going to happen there. I think the new federal government has been in office for about a month, I guess. One thing I would say is that we've heard the Prime Minister and the Minister of Natural Resources indicate their openness to listen. They've talked about the importance of Canada securing markets. So all we can say at this point is we're looking forward to engaging with the federal staff on this. And in the meantime, though, we're going to still focus on what we've been doing since we got the approval for the project, their certificate, at least, which is to focus continued discussions on First Nations consultation. And as a reminder, we also have 28 Aboriginal equity partners that are keen to invest in the project alongside us. So we'll be working with them as well to continue to discuss the project. And hopefully, we'll have some good discussions with all levels of government.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Krugel (Attendees)】\nAnother Gateway question. I'm just wondering how long you think it will be before Enbridge is able to decide one way or the other whether to actually go ahead and what factors you'll be looking for, aside from the Aboriginal consultation, before you're ready to make that FID?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nYes. Well, we're not going to be specific on timing. And the reason for that, Lauren, is in this environment and certainly the way we're looking at the business today, we want to make sure that we're taking the time we need not just with First Nations, as you point out, but with governments, particularly in BC and communities. So we're in the mode of making sure that people understand the project. I think that's the main driver. As Guy will tell you, the production profile of the basin under current commodity prices is obviously a little bit lower than it has been in the past. So we feel pretty good about our Mainline capability and serving the needs of customers in the next little while here. So in a way, the timing isn't too concerning to us. We continue to work on the things we need to as far as communities, First Nations and governments.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Krugel (Attendees)】\nIs it something that might be feasible in 2016, do you think, or are you thinking past that point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nYou're referring to with respect to concluding on whether there's a need, or are you talking about making a final investment decision?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Krugel (Attendees)】\nAn FID on Gateway.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Al Monaco (Executives)】\nOkay. That's possible. I would say, at this point, it's probably going to be in the latter half of 2016, if I had to make a guess.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam McKnight (Executives)】\nThank you, Hilda. We have nothing further to add at this time. But I'd like to remind you that the Investor Relations team will be available for any follow-up questions that you might have. And once again, thanks for joining us this morning, and have a good day.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. \r\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. \r\nAfter our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] \r\nI would like to thank you for attending our 2015 investor conference in October. We appreciated the opportunity to share with you our strategy and to give you a chance to hear from other members of our senior management team.\r\nI will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2015 results is Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\r\nHopefully, you saw our announcement earlier this week that Cindy Holmes has been promoted to Senior Director of Pension Investments. I wanted to take a moment to thank Cindy for her service in Investor Relations. Both Mike and I appreciate Cindy's efforts these past several years, which you know have been exciting and transformative years for Kroger. We know she will continue to contribute to Kroger's success in her new role.\r\nI'd also like to introduce Kate Ward, who has been promoted to Director of Investor Relations. Kate joined Kroger in 2001 and has held a number of leadership roles in our audit and finance departments. We hope you'll join us in welcoming Kate to her new role.\r\nWe often say that Kroger's success starts and ends with our more than 400,000 associates connecting with our customers every day. Our third quarter results are a terrific example of our team's ever deepening connection with customers. We achieved our 48th consecutive quarter, that is 12 consecutive years, of positive identical supermarket sales growth with very strong ID sales of 5.4%. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4-quarter basis, and we continue to manage costs so that we can continue investing to grow our business for the future while delivering today. Based on Kroger's strong third quarter performance, we are raising our identical supermarket sales guidance and our net earnings per diluted share guidance for the year.\r\nDuring the third quarter, we contributed $80 million to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan. This is the latest in a series of steps we've taken during the last 4 years to help stabilize pension benefits for our associates while continuing to deliver strong shareholder value. In January 2012, we agreed to establish the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan by working with the union to consolidate 4 multiemployer pension funds into one. This agreement protected pensions already earned and provided greater stability for future benefits of more than 65,000 Kroger associates. In June 2014, we announced similar agreements with 2 additional multiemployer pension funds. All of these steps reflect our strategic decision to increase certainty of pension benefits for our associates. These are examples of how we identify opportunity to use our financial flexibility.\r\nWe are very excited about our pending merger with Roundy's. We have filed our tender offer documents, and while we wait for the conclusion of that process and regulatory approval, I simply want to reiterate how much we are looking forward to welcoming Roundy's team to the Kroger family of stores.\r\nThe economy overall continues to slowly improve, and customers continue to feel more optimistic. But the bifurcation in the economy remains. Some customers are willing to spend more while others are worried about their job or next paycheck, are more focused on saving. We find that all customers want quality products and a great shopping experience. For the customer who's more focused on natural and organic products, we have our own Simple Truth brand. We also have many entry-level price point items of excellent quality. For customers looking for incredibly high-quality products like Boar's Head or Murray's Cheese, just to name a couple, we have that, too. Our job is to understand and deliver for our diverse set of customers so that they can save where they want to save and splurge where they want to splurge.\r\nFinally, before I turn it over to Mike, I would like to note that there is an important global dialogue taking place that underscores the positive role businesses can play in sustainability. Kroger's team has been making progress to integrate sustainable practices into our everyday business operations. For example, our stores and manufacturing facilities have made significant progress by reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills. In 5 years, the number of stores recycling food waste has increased 73% from 290 to more than 1,000 this year. 30 of our 37 manufacturing plants are sending zero waste to landfills, an increase of 9 facilities since 2013. \r\nTaken together, along with a lot of other efforts, Kroger is sending 69% less waste to landfills than we used to, and we will continue to work toward zero waste. This is only possible due to the thousands of individual activities our associates are doing on a daily basis. Their efforts are helping make each community we serve a better place to live, and they have helped Kroger earn a spot on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the third consecutive year. More than 600 companies in North America are evaluated each year, and only the top 20% are listed on the index. This is obviously something we're very proud of. We look forward to sharing our new 5-year sustainability goals with an eye toward pushing even faster and having more accelerated progress in the near future. \r\nAs you can see, we have a lot going on at Kroger. I am thrilled with our financial results and what we are doing for our associates, our customers, our communities and shareholders. \r\nNow Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's third quarter results, provide an update on labor relations and an update on our guidance for 2015. Mike?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to echo Rodney's comments relative to Cindy and also welcome Kate to the team.\r\nFirst, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our results for the quarter in each of the key performance target areas from our long-term growth plan. Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. As Rodney noted earlier, we are very pleased with our 5.4% identical supermarket sales growth in the third quarter. It reflects the underlying strength of our core business and our associates' growing connection with customers. Identical supermarket sales growth was driven by a combination of very strong tonnage growth plus an increase in both the number of households shopping with us and the number of visits per household in the third quarter. \r\nAs you know, our goal is to grow the number of loyal households at a faster rate than the number of total households who shop with us. I'm happy to report that we continue to meet this goal quarter after quarter. All geographies and supermarket departments had positive identical supermarket sales excluding fuel during the quarter, with our deli and produce departments leading the way. We continue to see outstanding double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department.\r\nOur second market -- our second metric is FIFO operating margin without fuel. Several items are included -- are excluded from our third quarter rolling 4 quarters calculations, specifically the 2014 and 2013 adjustment items, the contribution to The Kroger Co. Foundation in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and the contribution to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in the fourth quarter of 2014 and third quarter of 2015. While items like this occur over time, we feel it is important to report how our operations are performing. On this basis and without fuel, FIFO operating margin increased 18 basis points in the third quarter.\r\nOur operating margin has expanded more than our goal largely due to a combination of 2 factors: first, continued stronger-than-expected ID sales; second, the continued incremental investments we are making in our Customer 1st Strategy are being made in a sustainable way based on insights from 84.51°. This is not a new normal for operating margin expansion, but rather a demonstration of our diligence in how and when we invest.\r\nReturn on invested capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis was 14.16%. We are not presenting the comparative number this quarter because of last year's third quarter calculation does not include a full year of Harris Teeter assets and results. We continue to expect return on invested capital for fiscal 2015 to increase from fiscal 2014. This is an important metric as we continue to increase our capital investment to drive our future growth.\r\nBefore I share our third quarter results in more detail, I'd like to discuss how we are successfully managing through the current inflationary environment. While inflation continued at a lower rate during the third quarter, which we estimate was approximately 1.1% without fuel, some commodities had high inflation and others had deflation. We saw deflation in produce, while meat, seafood, deli and milk were all -- I'm sorry, we saw inflation in produce, while meat, seafood, deli and milk were all deflationary. We continue to see inflation in pharmaceuticals.\r\nNow I'll share our third quarter results in more detail. As you know, we don't provide guidance for total sales because of the unpredictable influence that fuel has on our overall results. Total sales in the third quarter were affected by the lower retail price of fuel, much like in the second and third quarters -- or first and second quarters. The average price of fuel during the third quarter was $2.30 compared to $3.22 last year. Total sales in the third quarter increased 0.4% to $25.1 billion compared to $25 billion in the same period last year. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 5.5% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year.\r\nIn the third quarter, our net earnings totaled $428 million or $0.43 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $362 million or $0.36 per diluted share, including a $0.02 benefit due to certain tax items. Excluding this, Kroger's net adjusted earnings were $345 million or $0.35 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. These numbers don't sum due to rounding.\r\nKroger recorded a $9 million LIFO charge during the third quarter compared to an $85 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. We have lowered our full year LIFO expectation to $75 million from $90 million previously. The FIFO gross margin, excluding retail fuel operations, decreased 4 basis points from the same period last year.\r\nStrong identical supermarket sales growth and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage core operating expenses as a rate of sales in the third quarter. Total operating expenses excluding retail fuel operations, a $25 million contribution to The Kroger Co. Foundation in the third quarter of 2014 and an $80 million contribution to the UFCW pension plan in the third quarter of '15 decreased 23 basis points as a percent of sales compared to last year. Third quarter FIFO profit excluding fuel and the adjustments I mentioned just a moment ago increased approximately $66 million over the prior year.\r\nNow for retail fuel operations. In the third quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.238 compared to $0.232 in the same quarter last year. Fuel results have been more difficult to predict than normal. We do not expect fuel margins to remain this -- we did not expect fuel margins to remain this high this late in the year. Our expectation for the fourth quarter is a moderation in margins. Volatility in weekly fuel costs remain high, and where those costs end up will influence our fourth quarter results.\r\nCorporate Brands' performance during the third quarter was strong, representing approximately 27.7% of total units sold and 25.9% of sales dollars excluding fuel and pharmacy. Simple Truth continues to grow at an astonishing rate, setting a record high for total sales in the third quarter while continuing to establish all-time weekly sales records throughout the quarter. Our newest Brand, HemisFares, has been embraced by foodie customers so much so that we are currently working with our Sicilian gelato supplier to expand capacity while maintaining the best-in-the-world quality of the product.\r\nI will provide a brief update on labor relations. We ratified contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Denver and with the Teamsters covering our Southern California distribution centers. We are currently negotiating a contract with the UFCW for store associates in Portland. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions which represent many of our associates should have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.\r\nKroger's long-term financial strategy is to use its financial flexibility to drive growth while also returning capital to shareholders. Maintaining its current investment-grade debt rating is the cornerstone of this, and it allows the company to use cash flow to take advantage of strategically and financially compelling opportunities and to continue its fill-in strategy, repurchase shares and fund the dividend, which is expected to increase over time. Our strong financial position has allowed us to return $1.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. During the third quarter, Kroger repurchased approximately 853,000 common shares for a total investment of $31 million.\r\nCapital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and the purchases of leased facilities totaled $832 million for the third quarter compared to $681 million for the same period last year. We expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and the purchases of leased facilities to slightly exceed $3.3 billion for the year. We continue to see a strong pipeline of high-quality projects and are encouraged by the results from our new stores. In order to have a steady flow of projects and increase the total number of store projects, we are spending on stores scheduled to open in 2016 to make sure they are ready to meet our target dates. Additionally, we continue to reduce the amount of time it takes to complete projects. \r\nThe company's net total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio decreased to 1.99 compared to 2.27 during the same period last year. We expect our net total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio to remain under 2.2 upon the close of our Roundy's merger transaction. Kroger's net total debt is $11.3 billion compared to $11.5 billion during the same period last year. As I mentioned last quarter, we have essentially maintained our absolute debt level while returning $1.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters, investing $3.2 billion in capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis, plus an additional $160 million on mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. In other words, we are keeping our commitments to bondholders and shareholders while creating opportunities for our associates.\r\nNow I'd like to update our growth objectives for the remainder of 2015. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we raised our net earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $2.02 to $2.04 for fiscal 2015. The previous guidance was $1.92 to $1.98 per share. This range exceeds the company's long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that's expected to increase over time. As with our third quarter results, the performance of fuel in the fourth quarter will determine where we end up in the range. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel of 4% to 4.5%. As we said in our press release this morning, that implies an annual guidance range of approximately 5% to 5.25%.\r\nNow I will turn it back to Rodney.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mike. As you can see, Kroger delivered another spectacular quarter and marked our 12th consecutive year of positive quarterly identical sales -- supermarket sales growth. When you achieve such consistently remarkable results quarter after quarter, it's easy to take them for granted. In fact, we've spent the past few years investing in our unique and multifaceted business model, which we believe has been a key driver of our success. We continually strive to innovate for our customers while delivering on our commitments to you, our shareholders. At a time when so many other retailers are facing very difficult circumstances, Kroger continues to stand out from the pack, thanks to our incredible associates. \r\nNow we look forward to your questions.",

      "transcript_text3": "It's actually Judah on for Ed. And congrats to Cindy and Kate on the new roles. First, just wanted to ask about the Q4 comp guidance. Is that an indication of where you're running Q4 to date? Or is there just some conservatism built into that given that you're early on in a big quarter?\n\n---\n\nIf you look at so far, and obviously, it's still very early in the quarter and we're cycling very strong numbers a year ago, we would be at the top end of the range that we provided. So it really isn't trying to be conservative. It's just reflecting the fact that we're cycling some incredibly strong numbers and inflation continues to get a little lower. The other thing that you never know is how is the weather going to flow. Obviously, snow is helpful for the business, and that, you really don't -- you can't predict at all. And then, as Mike just mentioned to me, this year, we will not have a Super Bowl in the fourth quarter. A year ago, we had Super Bowl in the fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that makes sense. And then touching on the gross margin performance. I mean, you've lapped Harris Teeter fully now, and we still don't see a lot of investment in margin. I mean, maybe Mike referenced it in that you're doing good work with 84.51°. But is this kind of a new normal, like a less than 10 basis point investment in ex fuel gross margin?\n\n---\n\nI'll hesitate to give what a normal is for an investment because we do continue to make investments in price in a variety of areas of our store. I'd say it's a reflection of prudence on how and when we make investments. Additionally, the mix. When you look at the strength of brands like Simple Truth, when you look at the strength of natural and organics, all of which have a little bit higher gross margin, that certainly plays into the overall mix of business. But if you were to look at gross margins by department, you'd probably have a little bit different view of exactly how and when we invest. But we will continue to invest not only in price but all 4 keys of our Customer 1st Strategy.\n\n---\n\nAnd we continue to have strong growth in our fresh departments, and most of the fresh departments have higher gross as well.\n\n---\n\nSo you guys are very good at data analytics and targeted marketing. So I was wondering, what are you seeing in terms of available promotional dollars and how they're being allocated in store versus out of store? And I guess the question is kind of for the industry and more specifically, if it's any different for you at Kroger.\n\n---\n\nWell, obviously, we really don't know what's going on across the industry because we only know what's happening for us. What we've tried to do is to work with our CPG partners, and we really do view them as partners. And what we're trying to focus on is how to grow their business and grow our business both. And it's really trying to make sure that we effectively spend the money that they provide to us that we then, in turn, provide to our customers. So it's really taking that data and helping our CPG partners to most effectively spend their money. So all I can do is talk for what we're doing. I really don't know what's going on in the industry.\n\n---\n\nCongratulations to Cindy and Kate on the new roles. I think most folks were pleased with the results and the outlook, and it seems like you might be taking a somewhat conservative approach because of things like fuel gross margin, inflation and weather. So wondering if you could run us through some of the puts and takes in the fourth quarter. And more specifically, what type of fuel gross margins are you baking in?\n\n---\n\nYes. When you look at the puts and takes, as Rodney said, weather is often difficult to predict. Last year, actually, was a pretty favorable weather event for us. Not only did we have the Super Bowl right at the end of the fourth quarter, we also had a fairly large snow event in the Midwest at the end of the fourth quarter, and both of those served to have some pretty strong sales that very last week of the quarter. As I said in my prepared comments, the ability to predict fuel margins this year has been more difficult than I can remember since we've been in the fuel business, which is really since 1983 when we merged with Dillon Companies. It's not just where weekly retails and supply and things like that wind up, it's really the day-to-day volatility of fuel on the open market because we don't have fuel contracts, we buy everything in the open market. And frankly, we're very -- we feel good -- we feel very good about where our core business is going, the day-to-day runnings inside of our store and the ability to predict that and the strength of our ID sales, as we noted with the guidance for the fourth quarter. Where we wind up in the $2.02 to $2.04 will be wholly predicated on where fuel margins wind up for the quarter.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And as a follow-up, what are you sort of expecting in pharmacy margins? And also, I don't know, it might be too early, but any color on 2016 puts and takes as well?\n\n---\n\nA couple. On pharmacy, it continues to be tough as it's been all year, and there's obviously a ton of change going on. And what we really remain focused on is making sure we're helping our customers. We have a great team of friendly and knowledgeable professionals that will help our customers get healthy quicker, and it eliminates one stop somewhere else. When you look at overall, we feel like we have a very strong business model, and it's also the nice thing about having such a diverse business, when you look at across all our lines, that we can make investments in pharmacy, but when you look at the total business, it continues to perform well. Relative to 2016 guidance, I'll say a couple of comments, Mike, and if you want to add anything, but we'll give the details in March. We have a meeting where we review our objectives with our board, and that -- obviously, we're not going to share things publicly until the board is in concert with what we're doing. A couple of comments just to remind everyone, and it really ties back to some of the things that Mike and I have already said. Fuel margins, we would expect to more normalize. And if you look at inflation, we would expect it to continue to be less. But when you look at overall, and this isn't just for '16, but our long-term objective remains to grow earnings per share by 8% to 11%, plus an increasing dividend. And that's the long-term objective. And then we'll give more detail in '16.\n\n---\n\nThis is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Just following up on your inflation comment just now. Just curious if you have any specific expectations for Q4. And then specifically, next year, I mean, you mentioned you expect it to go lower. I mean, any thoughts with regards to how we should think about generic drug inflation for the upcoming year?\n\n---\n\nGenerics continue to have a good amount of inflation in them. We really don't see anything as we look into 2016 that would necessarily cause a moderation. Part of that was driven by prices had gotten so low, some folks got out of the manufacture of those products. With good old supply and demand and just basic economic forces, if underlying costs for those continue to be high, at some point, other folks will get back into the manufacture of that business and perhaps put pressure on that economic cycle. Relative to inflation for the fourth quarter, our view would be it would be in the range of where the third quarter was and in the low 1s. And as we look into next year, we would certainly expect full year inflation for next year probably to be comparable to where inflation is for this year. We don't see a lot out there in the overall supply chain that would cause this to be different.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's very helpful. And then just switching gears to your loyalty program offering. I mean, we've seen a number of the specialty grocers recently discuss plans for new loyalty programs with different propositions for consumers across each. Clearly, Kroger has had success with fuel points in recent years. I guess I'd just be curious, how often do you tweak the value proposition with your loyalty card offering? How important is the points part of the offering versus maybe some of the other components that your program offers? Any thoughts that you could share, that would be really helpful.\n\n---\n\nWell, we would look at our loyalty program as not tweaking. What we do is we continually use the insights to improve what our customers get, and it's based on how customers react. So it's constantly using what customers actually do to try to do a better offer for our customers on a personalized basis. And the examples you gave would just be small parts of what the overall loyalty offering is for a customer. And the key is -- for anybody doing it is how do you make it worth something the customer finds of value.\n\n---\n\nCindy, we'll miss you, and Kate, look forward to working with you. I just wanted to follow up -- go back to 2016 on a higher level. I guess, can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on the Medicare Part D component because I guess the color would be that the reimbursement rates could come down fairly meaningfully. And so that -- I realize that could be maybe a bigger headwind for you in 2016. Obviously, gas margins are a wild card. But then as I think about maybe tailwind for '16, Roundy's accretion could be a bit more of a tailwind than you've guided to, inflation is kind of neutral. Any more color you could give on any of those?\n\n---\n\nWe won't -- as Rodney said, we're not going to go too far down the path of talking about 2016. Clearly, the litany of things you laid out, it's almost as if you have a draft of our business plan board book that we're getting ready to finish up at the end of the month and send to our board about the topics we will discuss with them in January. All of those are on our radar screen. We're putting all of those into the mix as we decide what 2016 is going to look like with our board. As Rodney said, we're committed to the 8% to 11% as a long-term earnings per share growth target. And it just wouldn't behoove either he or I, if we want to be on the March call, to get out in front of our board with talking about '16 much more.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's fair. And I guess just looking at the O&A growth rate this quarter excluding rents and depreciation. I guess when I look at the last 3 quarters, it's been pretty consistent kind of in the 5.5% range, and I realize for next year, Roundy's is going to impact that number, but is that kind of -- do you think that's a fair run rate to look at on a more sustainable basis?\n\n---\n\nThe 5.5% -- I missed the first part of your comment.\n\n---\n\nWell, it seems to be -- you've been kind of consistently in that 5.5-ish range for the first -- well, for the first 3 quarters of the year. So excluding what Roundy's might do to that number, is that kind of the right run rate to think about on a more sustainable basis? Because I know we've talked about there was some investments in services and things like that, that you were making because you knew it would drive sales. So I just kind of want an update on that.\n\n---\n\nYes. I actually haven't calculated exactly what our OG&A growth has been, and I don't know if you're taking out the onetime items from those if you look at our core business. Our rate to sales is -- or if you're doing it with or without fuel. Our ongoing -- if I look at it without fuel, it's actually under -- year-to-date, it's actually under a 5% increase, and that's including the pension contribution in there. We look at those service investments the same way we look at price investments. And we step back and we have a very defined plan and a very diligent plan of what we expect to do in departments and how we expect to make incremental investments in all 4 keys of the Customer 1st Strategy. And some of those are price, which become more obvious because of the gross margin calculation. Others of those are a little less obvious because when you look at things like service, they can get drastically covered up. The whole idea of adding service in some of these departments would be to grow sales, and that's how they wind up getting paid for. So when you -- overall, we would expect to continue to drive operating costs down and use that as part of the fuel for the engine to continue to invest.\n\n---\n\nCindy and Kate, congratulations on your new roles. Two questions from me. One, a little bit of a follow-up on a question that was asked earlier. But a lot of the CPG companies, especially on the packaged food side, right, companies that really -- like Kraft, right, they're running that 3G playbook. They're talking very vociferous actually about how they're trying to get off that promo needle, get much more about baseline sales. I'm not talking about any particular vendor, but are you seeing any evidence that, that's actually taking place, where a lot of your larger food vendors are perhaps getting a little bit less aggressive with deal-backs? Or is it really not affecting anything yet from your view?\n\n---\n\nWell, I will answer your question that -- well, partially answer your question. What we find is -- CPG companies, there's -- we deal with a lot of different CPG companies, and any point in time, you'll have different companies with different strategies. And we have a team that will work with CPGs based on the strategy that they're playing. What we find is when CPGs raise prices when it's not economically driven, our Corporate Brands always picks up market share. And it's one of the values of having an incredibly strong corporate brand program, is that when there's something that doesn't make economic sense, the customer understands that. So we -- at any point in time, probably almost any comment you would make on a CPG, there's somebody out there running that playbook, and each one would have their own playbook.\n\n---\n\nWanted to ask about your -- you gave some helpful commentary around the macro environment and kind of the puts and takes of the consumer spending behaviors. And if we try to, in a sense, kind of reconcile that with your natural, organic, your Corporate Brands specifically, of course, continue to tick up, what are you seeing as you're looking at your loyalty data? Have there been any notable changes in terms of kind of categories or products that are going into the basket more or less? And I guess, in turn, are you changing the way you're maybe space allocating in any way that might be helpful to share with us?\n\n---\n\nWell, if you look at -- there's constantly changes going on in the basket, and it's not so much new. But if you look at the fresh departments, that's been a trend that's been ongoing for a long period of time and isn't slowing down at all. The things that you ticked off -- mentioned on natural and organics, that as well. If you look at space allocation, it's something that is really important to do on an ongoing basis. And one of the examples I always like to give is coffee. If you asked me 3 years ago or 4 years ago, what I thought was going to be the future of the coffee category, I wouldn't have been very positive. Today, because of innovation by Starbucks and Keurig Green Mountain, it's completely created a different type of growth in that category, and we're continually adding space on what's inside the store because the customers want it, and it's something that is driven by innovation. So the change in allocation is more driven by innovation than probably anything else and how the customers react to that innovation.\n\n---\n\nOkay. All right, that's helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up, just on Roundy's, just checking, does it still look like the deal should be closing before the end of this calendar year?\n\n---\n\nAs Rodney said in our prepared comments, we filed our tender offer. And we filed with the regulators, and it's pending both of those coming to a closure.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions. One, just on the inflation, I thought the commentary about produce is inflationary and meat, seafood, deli, et cetera, deflationary. Mike, I think you've made comments in the past about there's good deflation and bad deflation. And so as you're looking into fourth quarter and then into the 2016 overall inflation being similar, can you maybe speak to the components, sort of how inflation is playing out right now, if you guys think that produce still inflationary, sort of the same dynamics? And then remind us if these are better dynamics than other ways to get to this sort of lower level of inflation. And then if you can maybe just weave in what you're seeing in the competitive environment right now. Is it same, worse, better?\n\n---\n\nSure. Relative to inflation, it's -- overall, it continues to be a mixed bag and particularly when you look at the fresh departments, like produce, like meat, like seafood. Produce, in particular, it generally bounces around a lot during the year. When you see dramatic inflation in produce, it's not a good selling season because it's been bad growing for whatever region it is that's there. Earlier in the year, when we saw a lot of dramatic deflation in produce, it was driven by 2 things. One, last year's first quarter was relatively strong inflation, and then this year, you had a good growing crop. So you're really back to a more normal kind of a crop for produce. And actually, if you look at on a 2-year basis, the first quarter last year and the first quarter of this year, combined, they were slightly inflationary. So it's a more of a normal. While the fourth quarter was inflationary, it was just slightly inflationary. Meat, obviously, has gotten a lot of headlines as having been so high for so long, high prices. Clearly, with what supply and demand do, high prices over time, people stop eating as much meat and -- whether it's beef or chicken or pork. That means supply picks up a little bit, and guess what, prices start to come down. And if you look at it on a -- if a 2-year stack on something like inflation makes any sense at all, we're still net higher than we were a couple of years ago but still well down from peaks of last year. So it's a mixed bag. We think things like that are going to persist into 2016. The wild card is always where -- exactly where is pharmaceutical inflation going to be, and it has been very, very high for really the last couple of years. Relative to the competitive environment, I don't think there's a time that Rodney and I have been doing these calls together that we haven't talked about this being a highly competitive industry. Barriers to entry are low. Our job is to go out every day with our more than 400,000 associates and deliver a better value proposition to our customers today than we did yesterday, and that's solely what we're focused on. Sure, we keep an eye on the competitive environment. There are a lot of people out there trying to sell what we sell, and our job is just to do it a little bit better every day and win that customer every day when they wake up and make sure they want to come to Kroger.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And just a quick follow-up. Could you guys give us a click list update on those, I think it was 19 non-Harris Teeter stores and how that's progressing?\n\n---\n\nYes. It's still something that -- we're still early in the test. We continue to roll it out for customers. Some customers like it a lot, and it's just one more reason to shop at Kroger.\n\n---\n\nSo I just wanted to get back to something you mentioned on the gross margin, which was with the mix shifting. I wanted to get your perspective on kind of what inning we're in on that mix shift. I mean, obviously, you've got fast-growing categories like private label, been a few private label, you have the fresh categories. I do believe you guys are in the process of updating your prepared food area as well, which tends to have a lot better gross margins. So as we look out, and this is really not next year, it's really more of a 3-year outlook, it seems to me that this mix shift should remain and maybe even accelerate and be helpful. Am I off base on that?\n\n---\n\nScott, it's a phenomena that continues, and to say what inning we would be in on the changing needs and desires of the consumer would be -- would probably be shortsighted on my part and I would be absolutely wrong. We certainly do a lot of predictive analytics with data we see not just inside our stores but overall in the economy, trying to figure out where the consumer is going. It clearly does seem as though there's going to be persistence in the shift to a more healthy lifestyle and maybe out of some of the traditional center-of-the-store categories and into more fresh categories. But I would tell you there are plenty of center-of-the-store categories that now have natural and organic offerings in a can, whether it's our own Simple Truth brand with spaghetti sauces and salsas and things like that. If you go down the dog food aisle, the growth in the dog food aisle is in grain-free and natural kinds of dog food. So even our pets are jumping onto the bandwagon of leading a healthier lifestyle. Everybody's laughing at me in the room by the way. But it's something that our job is to make sure we're there to deliver what the customer wants when they want it. And we will certainly stay on track with it. In trying to predict where the customer is going, I don't think I'll get into that. But we're happy with our overall offering. We're happy with our continued growth and thrilled with the team we have working on not just the center of the store and keeping it a healthy and vibrant category but all the fresh departments around the perimeter of the store as well.\n\n---\n\nScott, you've followed Kroger for a long time, and you know one of the things that we try to do is make sure we design our business model so it's successful regardless of the environment and try to really play to what's going on in the environment. And some of those examples, that's what's going on now, but customers change and we try to make sure that we stay nimble enough to be able to react to those changes.\n\n---\n\nOkay, perfect. And then I actually had a question, at the Analyst Day, you guys laid out a very compelling case about market share and how that drives returns over time and that one of the big growth drivers you see for Kroger is taking some markets that maybe are a little bit below where the ideal share is and driving them up. As I survey your business, one of those areas seems to be the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast that happen to be with Harris Teeter. How do we think about those areas geographically and what you can do to maybe get the market shares up over 20% to really drive some handsome returns?\n\n---\n\nThe -- we -- other than at the Analyst Day, we did give specifics on one market. We won't make it a habit of giving specifics, so we really do look at across all of the opportunities. When we merged with Harris Teeter, one of the things we talked about was one of the reasons we were excited about merging with Harris Teeter is the opportunities that they had in several of the markets that you mentioned. We're equally or more excited today about that opportunity going forward as when we merged with Harris Teeter. So beyond that, I won't get into any more specifics on a market, other than, as we outlined, we see this as a long-term opportunity across a lot of markets.\n\n---\n\nSo you would -- densing up would be -- would definitely help you guys in those markets.\n\n---\n\nWell, it would help us in most of our markets.\n\n---\n\nYes. As we've long said, the higher our market share, the higher our ROA in a particular market, and that's really the cornerstone to increasing the number of markets with that high correlation.\n\n---\n\nIt's actually Steve on for John today. As it relates to the capital development program, is there a focus on speeding up the pace of investments here, I guess, to capitalize on some opportunities? Or should we still assume the $200 million of incremental spend annually looking out?\n\n---\n\nWell, again, I won't get into what our guidance is for 2016. But we do continue to have a great pipeline of projects and are very encouraged by our early projects. We will continue to grow capital as we go into 2016 compared to 2015. The $200 million is a number that I would say, for the next several years, we would increase capital by at least that amount. Keep in mind, as I increase capital and I increase my base -- my store base and the number of stores, I also have to increase maintenance capital a little bit to keep those stores fresh over time. So it's not just an allocation -- a new allocation to new stores. I'm going to have to make sure I continue to take care of the base operations as well.\n\n---\n\nAnd part of the thing that Mike talked about on speeding up, it's really our real estate teams, our facility engineering teams, our division teams and our attorneys working together to take time out of the process on how long it takes us to get a store open. So it's really everybody working together, actually taking weeks out of construction time, which is causing some of the acceleration of capital investment.\n\n---\n\nRight.\n\n---\n\nAnd just a follow-up. As we try to figure out, right, the impact here of the development program, can you touch or remind us of, I guess, the normal comp maturation of a marketplace or the maturation of the store-level EBITDA margin?\n\n---\n\nWhen you said the normal comp maturation, what do you mean?\n\n---\n\nI guess, the store opens at an initial productivity of 70% or so. I mean, what is -- year 1 and year 2, right, there's going to be a benefit on the comp side. Do you see a pretty significant ramp both in comp and profitability on the store -- at the store level? Because year 1...\n\n---\n\nClearly, when you open a store, the first 6 to 12 months of that store opening, with all the preopening costs that get expensed on the day you open, it takes a while for that store to turn black on an EBITDA standpoint. It doesn't become a comp store until the fifth full quarter that it's open, the way we do IDs. So it's a while before they contribute to IDs. In some markets, as we dense up, you have the potential to have a little bit of sister store impact. So from a total sales standpoint, you're getting exactly what you want wanted. From an ID standpoint in a particular geography, you may have a little degradation in a particular geography from their ID sales as you dense up in a particular market. Now some of these markets, our market share is low enough where that won't be as big of a deal, but we continue to monitor that as well.\n\n---\n\nOn the ID sales, I want to compare them to Q2 because it was kind of the same number both for the print and for the inflation. So I think I recall in Q2, you said it was very much volume-driven, and I'm not sure you said that here. I think I hear you talking a little bit more about mix. Should we take away from that, that, that number has a better mix element this quarter than last quarter?\n\n---\n\nIt was heavily driven by volume again. Very strong. I just...\n\n---\n\nYes. In my prepared comments, I said it was a combination of very strong tonnage plus an increase in the number of households shopping with us and the number of visits per household during the time frame. So it's a combination of all of those.\n\n---\n\nBut tonnage was very, very strong.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay, good to hear. So there's no real update on mix, it's sort of the bifurcated message continues.\n\n---\n\nIt really is the same thing that continues to play out. But it -- now it's playing out on top of years where it played out, so it's growth on top of growth.\n\n---\n\nTwo more follow-ups. On 84.51°, you've been asked about it and you pointed to it. Can you maybe call out some areas of the marketing where it really is helping? We're used to sort of unique promotions, but is it also in pricing? And I know Vinny asked about allocation, but could you give us a high level there as to where it's currently -- is it helping the business more than it has maybe as we're used to hearing about? And also, when you announced the split from dunnhumby you said you could probably work with some -- or excited to work with similar companies. Any update there would be helpful as well.\n\n---\n\nYes. On working with other companies, that we wouldn't share at this point other than saying that we continue -- that's something that is part of what we're allowed to do now, and we work against that. On helping more than the past, one of the things -- even some of the examples that you gave, just by continuing to learn and continuing to be more integrated, we're making progress on top of where we were. So to me, the biggest improvement and change has been, in the meetings now, the 84.51° team is part of the same meeting. So you're not having a discussion and deciding what to do and then going out -- going back and sitting down with 84.51° to say, \"Okay, here's what we want you to do.\" It's actually everybody in the same meeting and their insights to say, \"Well, you're thinking about this, but it's probably better if you think about it this way.\" And it's really the professional insights and experiences that's helping us accelerate where we are versus necessarily just doing something new.\n\n---\n\nAnd in the past, while we owned half of them, they would have not been always around the table initially because we did only own half of them and they had obligations outside the Kroger world as well. So we have time for -- you had another follow-up?\n\n---\n\nYes. Just real quick on the $80 million pension contribution. I assume that was contemplated in your guidance, either for the quarter or for the year. I just wanted to double check that.\n\n---\n\nIt is contemplated in the guidance, in the $2.02 to $2.04 for the year. Those are things that, with some of the strong fuel margins, rather than that happening a little bit every so often, we've taken opportunity to put the money in when we have that tailwind. It gets the money into the fund, and they can start putting it to work faster than if we did it over time.\n\n---\n\nAnd I'll just reiterate the good luck to Cindy in the pensions. And I just wanted to ask a question about relative price gaps. I feel like everywhere I turn in the industry, someone's telling me just how aggressive you're being with price. Our studies show something similar, and your gross margin is just holding up remarkably well. You talked about the mix. But I guess I'm just wondering if you could talk about how you feel about your relative price gaps. Do you think you've maintained them, widened them? What do you think the plan for next year is?\n\n---\n\nWell, if you look at longer term, we've always assumed that markets will get more competitive, and that's been part of our business model really starting -- Dave caused us to start that years ago, and it's something that we just couldn't [indiscernible]. And we don't see that changing at all. The gap, I guess I would word it a different way. You're always trying to get better, but you're proud of where -- the progress you've made. And it's something that's very important for us to be able to make sure that we're giving our customers a better and better deal. Price is one element of that, but service is just as important, and we're focused as much on that in terms of fresher product and better service as well. And all of those things together is what we think creates a unique model for Kroger, and it's driving a lot of our success.\n\n---\n\nGreat, that's helpful. And then just a question on the pension contribution. It seems like -- I don't know if I'm thinking about this but -- the right way, but when you have these very strong gas margin environment that generates a little extra cash and earnings, you kind of offset that with these kind of onetime contributions. Is that the right way to think about that in terms of how you plan for these? And then just what is the status of the consolidated UFCW plan at this point?\n\n---\n\nWell, the status of it, it's in great shape. Cindy will make sure it stays that way. We did joke internally that it was her going-away present from IR to the pension group, but that wasn't. We -- these funds will need money over time. The -- our enrollment in these plans continues to grow. Folks continue to earn benefits. We have a great investment strategy, but they do require funds over time. And while we would budget them in to be made at different points in time, as I said earlier, when we have the opportunity and a little bit of tailwind and a few extra dollars in the coffers, we feel it's prudent to go ahead and put that money into the fund, let the fund put that money to work as quickly as possible to generate the return and continue to have strong benefits for our associates.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Kelly. Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. As I said a few minutes ago, Kroger's consistent outstanding results are easy to take for granted. The fact is your hard work in our stores and facilities every day makes it all possible. Your commitment to our customers brings our Customer 1st Strategy to life. In large and small ways, each and every day, what you do makes these terrific results possible. \r\nThe holiday season is such a special time of the year in our stores all over the country. You help millions of customers every day prepare for celebrations at their schools, offices, churches, homes and more. Thank you for your hard work to make the holidays brighter for each of them. You also make it a season of giving by working with Feeding America, the Salvation Army and other local community partners who help work with us to donate food and other items where they are needed most. Thank you, and thank you for being part of our big Kroger family. Merry Christmas, and happy holidays to you and your family.\r\nThat completes our call today. Thanks for joining.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Judah Frommer (Analysts)】\nIt's actually Judah on for Ed. And congrats to Cindy and Kate on the new roles. First, just wanted to ask about the Q4 comp guidance. Is that an indication of where you're running Q4 to date? Or is there just some conservatism built into that given that you're early on in a big quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIf you look at so far, and obviously, it's still very early in the quarter and we're cycling very strong numbers a year ago, we would be at the top end of the range that we provided. So it really isn't trying to be conservative. It's just reflecting the fact that we're cycling some incredibly strong numbers and inflation continues to get a little lower. The other thing that you never know is how is the weather going to flow. Obviously, snow is helpful for the business, and that, you really don't -- you can't predict at all. And then, as Mike just mentioned to me, this year, we will not have a Super Bowl in the fourth quarter. A year ago, we had Super Bowl in the fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judah Frommer (Analysts)】\nOkay, that makes sense. And then touching on the gross margin performance. I mean, you've lapped Harris Teeter fully now, and we still don't see a lot of investment in margin. I mean, maybe Mike referenced it in that you're doing good work with 84.51°. But is this kind of a new normal, like a less than 10 basis point investment in ex fuel gross margin?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nI'll hesitate to give what a normal is for an investment because we do continue to make investments in price in a variety of areas of our store. I'd say it's a reflection of prudence on how and when we make investments. Additionally, the mix. When you look at the strength of brands like Simple Truth, when you look at the strength of natural and organics, all of which have a little bit higher gross margin, that certainly plays into the overall mix of business. But if you were to look at gross margins by department, you'd probably have a little bit different view of exactly how and when we invest. But we will continue to invest not only in price but all 4 keys of our Customer 1st Strategy.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nAnd we continue to have strong growth in our fresh departments, and most of the fresh departments have higher gross as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Kirk (Analysts)】\nSo you guys are very good at data analytics and targeted marketing. So I was wondering, what are you seeing in terms of available promotional dollars and how they're being allocated in store versus out of store? And I guess the question is kind of for the industry and more specifically, if it's any different for you at Kroger.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, obviously, we really don't know what's going on across the industry because we only know what's happening for us. What we've tried to do is to work with our CPG partners, and we really do view them as partners. And what we're trying to focus on is how to grow their business and grow our business both. And it's really trying to make sure that we effectively spend the money that they provide to us that we then, in turn, provide to our customers. So it's really taking that data and helping our CPG partners to most effectively spend their money. So all I can do is talk for what we're doing. I really don't know what's going on in the industry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alvin Concepcion (Analysts)】\nCongratulations to Cindy and Kate on the new roles. I think most folks were pleased with the results and the outlook, and it seems like you might be taking a somewhat conservative approach because of things like fuel gross margin, inflation and weather. So wondering if you could run us through some of the puts and takes in the fourth quarter. And more specifically, what type of fuel gross margins are you baking in?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes. When you look at the puts and takes, as Rodney said, weather is often difficult to predict. Last year, actually, was a pretty favorable weather event for us. Not only did we have the Super Bowl right at the end of the fourth quarter, we also had a fairly large snow event in the Midwest at the end of the fourth quarter, and both of those served to have some pretty strong sales that very last week of the quarter. As I said in my prepared comments, the ability to predict fuel margins this year has been more difficult than I can remember since we've been in the fuel business, which is really since 1983 when we merged with Dillon Companies. It's not just where weekly retails and supply and things like that wind up, it's really the day-to-day volatility of fuel on the open market because we don't have fuel contracts, we buy everything in the open market. And frankly, we're very -- we feel good -- we feel very good about where our core business is going, the day-to-day runnings inside of our store and the ability to predict that and the strength of our ID sales, as we noted with the guidance for the fourth quarter. Where we wind up in the $2.02 to $2.04 will be wholly predicated on where fuel margins wind up for the quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alvin Concepcion (Analysts)】\nGreat. And as a follow-up, what are you sort of expecting in pharmacy margins? And also, I don't know, it might be too early, but any color on 2016 puts and takes as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nA couple. On pharmacy, it continues to be tough as it's been all year, and there's obviously a ton of change going on. And what we really remain focused on is making sure we're helping our customers. We have a great team of friendly and knowledgeable professionals that will help our customers get healthy quicker, and it eliminates one stop somewhere else. When you look at overall, we feel like we have a very strong business model, and it's also the nice thing about having such a diverse business, when you look at across all our lines, that we can make investments in pharmacy, but when you look at the total business, it continues to perform well. Relative to 2016 guidance, I'll say a couple of comments, Mike, and if you want to add anything, but we'll give the details in March. We have a meeting where we review our objectives with our board, and that -- obviously, we're not going to share things publicly until the board is in concert with what we're doing. A couple of comments just to remind everyone, and it really ties back to some of the things that Mike and I have already said. Fuel margins, we would expect to more normalize. And if you look at inflation, we would expect it to continue to be less. But when you look at overall, and this isn't just for '16, but our long-term objective remains to grow earnings per share by 8% to 11%, plus an increasing dividend. And that's the long-term objective. And then we'll give more detail in '16.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Erica Eiler (Analysts)】\nThis is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Just following up on your inflation comment just now. Just curious if you have any specific expectations for Q4. And then specifically, next year, I mean, you mentioned you expect it to go lower. I mean, any thoughts with regards to how we should think about generic drug inflation for the upcoming year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nGenerics continue to have a good amount of inflation in them. We really don't see anything as we look into 2016 that would necessarily cause a moderation. Part of that was driven by prices had gotten so low, some folks got out of the manufacture of those products. With good old supply and demand and just basic economic forces, if underlying costs for those continue to be high, at some point, other folks will get back into the manufacture of that business and perhaps put pressure on that economic cycle. Relative to inflation for the fourth quarter, our view would be it would be in the range of where the third quarter was and in the low 1s. And as we look into next year, we would certainly expect full year inflation for next year probably to be comparable to where inflation is for this year. We don't see a lot out there in the overall supply chain that would cause this to be different.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Erica Eiler (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's very helpful. And then just switching gears to your loyalty program offering. I mean, we've seen a number of the specialty grocers recently discuss plans for new loyalty programs with different propositions for consumers across each. Clearly, Kroger has had success with fuel points in recent years. I guess I'd just be curious, how often do you tweak the value proposition with your loyalty card offering? How important is the points part of the offering versus maybe some of the other components that your program offers? Any thoughts that you could share, that would be really helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, we would look at our loyalty program as not tweaking. What we do is we continually use the insights to improve what our customers get, and it's based on how customers react. So it's constantly using what customers actually do to try to do a better offer for our customers on a personalized basis. And the examples you gave would just be small parts of what the overall loyalty offering is for a customer. And the key is -- for anybody doing it is how do you make it worth something the customer finds of value.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nCindy, we'll miss you, and Kate, look forward to working with you. I just wanted to follow up -- go back to 2016 on a higher level. I guess, can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on the Medicare Part D component because I guess the color would be that the reimbursement rates could come down fairly meaningfully. And so that -- I realize that could be maybe a bigger headwind for you in 2016. Obviously, gas margins are a wild card. But then as I think about maybe tailwind for '16, Roundy's accretion could be a bit more of a tailwind than you've guided to, inflation is kind of neutral. Any more color you could give on any of those?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWe won't -- as Rodney said, we're not going to go too far down the path of talking about 2016. Clearly, the litany of things you laid out, it's almost as if you have a draft of our business plan board book that we're getting ready to finish up at the end of the month and send to our board about the topics we will discuss with them in January. All of those are on our radar screen. We're putting all of those into the mix as we decide what 2016 is going to look like with our board. As Rodney said, we're committed to the 8% to 11% as a long-term earnings per share growth target. And it just wouldn't behoove either he or I, if we want to be on the March call, to get out in front of our board with talking about '16 much more.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's fair. And I guess just looking at the O&A growth rate this quarter excluding rents and depreciation. I guess when I look at the last 3 quarters, it's been pretty consistent kind of in the 5.5% range, and I realize for next year, Roundy's is going to impact that number, but is that kind of -- do you think that's a fair run rate to look at on a more sustainable basis?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nThe 5.5% -- I missed the first part of your comment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nWell, it seems to be -- you've been kind of consistently in that 5.5-ish range for the first -- well, for the first 3 quarters of the year. So excluding what Roundy's might do to that number, is that kind of the right run rate to think about on a more sustainable basis? Because I know we've talked about there was some investments in services and things like that, that you were making because you knew it would drive sales. So I just kind of want an update on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes. I actually haven't calculated exactly what our OG&A growth has been, and I don't know if you're taking out the onetime items from those if you look at our core business. Our rate to sales is -- or if you're doing it with or without fuel. Our ongoing -- if I look at it without fuel, it's actually under -- year-to-date, it's actually under a 5% increase, and that's including the pension contribution in there. We look at those service investments the same way we look at price investments. And we step back and we have a very defined plan and a very diligent plan of what we expect to do in departments and how we expect to make incremental investments in all 4 keys of the Customer 1st Strategy. And some of those are price, which become more obvious because of the gross margin calculation. Others of those are a little less obvious because when you look at things like service, they can get drastically covered up. The whole idea of adding service in some of these departments would be to grow sales, and that's how they wind up getting paid for. So when you -- overall, we would expect to continue to drive operating costs down and use that as part of the fuel for the engine to continue to invest.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nCindy and Kate, congratulations on your new roles. Two questions from me. One, a little bit of a follow-up on a question that was asked earlier. But a lot of the CPG companies, especially on the packaged food side, right, companies that really -- like Kraft, right, they're running that 3G playbook. They're talking very vociferous actually about how they're trying to get off that promo needle, get much more about baseline sales. I'm not talking about any particular vendor, but are you seeing any evidence that, that's actually taking place, where a lot of your larger food vendors are perhaps getting a little bit less aggressive with deal-backs? Or is it really not affecting anything yet from your view?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, I will answer your question that -- well, partially answer your question. What we find is -- CPG companies, there's -- we deal with a lot of different CPG companies, and any point in time, you'll have different companies with different strategies. And we have a team that will work with CPGs based on the strategy that they're playing. What we find is when CPGs raise prices when it's not economically driven, our Corporate Brands always picks up market share. And it's one of the values of having an incredibly strong corporate brand program, is that when there's something that doesn't make economic sense, the customer understands that. So we -- at any point in time, probably almost any comment you would make on a CPG, there's somebody out there running that playbook, and each one would have their own playbook.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vincent Sinisi (Analysts)】\nWanted to ask about your -- you gave some helpful commentary around the macro environment and kind of the puts and takes of the consumer spending behaviors. And if we try to, in a sense, kind of reconcile that with your natural, organic, your Corporate Brands specifically, of course, continue to tick up, what are you seeing as you're looking at your loyalty data? Have there been any notable changes in terms of kind of categories or products that are going into the basket more or less? And I guess, in turn, are you changing the way you're maybe space allocating in any way that might be helpful to share with us?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, if you look at -- there's constantly changes going on in the basket, and it's not so much new. But if you look at the fresh departments, that's been a trend that's been ongoing for a long period of time and isn't slowing down at all. The things that you ticked off -- mentioned on natural and organics, that as well. If you look at space allocation, it's something that is really important to do on an ongoing basis. And one of the examples I always like to give is coffee. If you asked me 3 years ago or 4 years ago, what I thought was going to be the future of the coffee category, I wouldn't have been very positive. Today, because of innovation by Starbucks and Keurig Green Mountain, it's completely created a different type of growth in that category, and we're continually adding space on what's inside the store because the customers want it, and it's something that is driven by innovation. So the change in allocation is more driven by innovation than probably anything else and how the customers react to that innovation.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vincent Sinisi (Analysts)】\nOkay. All right, that's helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up, just on Roundy's, just checking, does it still look like the deal should be closing before the end of this calendar year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nAs Rodney said in our prepared comments, we filed our tender offer. And we filed with the regulators, and it's pending both of those coming to a closure.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nTwo questions. One, just on the inflation, I thought the commentary about produce is inflationary and meat, seafood, deli, et cetera, deflationary. Mike, I think you've made comments in the past about there's good deflation and bad deflation. And so as you're looking into fourth quarter and then into the 2016 overall inflation being similar, can you maybe speak to the components, sort of how inflation is playing out right now, if you guys think that produce still inflationary, sort of the same dynamics? And then remind us if these are better dynamics than other ways to get to this sort of lower level of inflation. And then if you can maybe just weave in what you're seeing in the competitive environment right now. Is it same, worse, better?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nSure. Relative to inflation, it's -- overall, it continues to be a mixed bag and particularly when you look at the fresh departments, like produce, like meat, like seafood. Produce, in particular, it generally bounces around a lot during the year. When you see dramatic inflation in produce, it's not a good selling season because it's been bad growing for whatever region it is that's there. Earlier in the year, when we saw a lot of dramatic deflation in produce, it was driven by 2 things. One, last year's first quarter was relatively strong inflation, and then this year, you had a good growing crop. So you're really back to a more normal kind of a crop for produce. And actually, if you look at on a 2-year basis, the first quarter last year and the first quarter of this year, combined, they were slightly inflationary. So it's a more of a normal. While the fourth quarter was inflationary, it was just slightly inflationary. Meat, obviously, has gotten a lot of headlines as having been so high for so long, high prices. Clearly, with what supply and demand do, high prices over time, people stop eating as much meat and -- whether it's beef or chicken or pork. That means supply picks up a little bit, and guess what, prices start to come down. And if you look at it on a -- if a 2-year stack on something like inflation makes any sense at all, we're still net higher than we were a couple of years ago but still well down from peaks of last year. So it's a mixed bag. We think things like that are going to persist into 2016. The wild card is always where -- exactly where is pharmaceutical inflation going to be, and it has been very, very high for really the last couple of years. Relative to the competitive environment, I don't think there's a time that Rodney and I have been doing these calls together that we haven't talked about this being a highly competitive industry. Barriers to entry are low. Our job is to go out every day with our more than 400,000 associates and deliver a better value proposition to our customers today than we did yesterday, and that's solely what we're focused on. Sure, we keep an eye on the competitive environment. There are a lot of people out there trying to sell what we sell, and our job is just to do it a little bit better every day and win that customer every day when they wake up and make sure they want to come to Kroger.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nGreat. And just a quick follow-up. Could you guys give us a click list update on those, I think it was 19 non-Harris Teeter stores and how that's progressing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes. It's still something that -- we're still early in the test. We continue to roll it out for customers. Some customers like it a lot, and it's just one more reason to shop at Kroger.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nSo I just wanted to get back to something you mentioned on the gross margin, which was with the mix shifting. I wanted to get your perspective on kind of what inning we're in on that mix shift. I mean, obviously, you've got fast-growing categories like private label, been a few private label, you have the fresh categories. I do believe you guys are in the process of updating your prepared food area as well, which tends to have a lot better gross margins. So as we look out, and this is really not next year, it's really more of a 3-year outlook, it seems to me that this mix shift should remain and maybe even accelerate and be helpful. Am I off base on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nScott, it's a phenomena that continues, and to say what inning we would be in on the changing needs and desires of the consumer would be -- would probably be shortsighted on my part and I would be absolutely wrong. We certainly do a lot of predictive analytics with data we see not just inside our stores but overall in the economy, trying to figure out where the consumer is going. It clearly does seem as though there's going to be persistence in the shift to a more healthy lifestyle and maybe out of some of the traditional center-of-the-store categories and into more fresh categories. But I would tell you there are plenty of center-of-the-store categories that now have natural and organic offerings in a can, whether it's our own Simple Truth brand with spaghetti sauces and salsas and things like that. If you go down the dog food aisle, the growth in the dog food aisle is in grain-free and natural kinds of dog food. So even our pets are jumping onto the bandwagon of leading a healthier lifestyle. Everybody's laughing at me in the room by the way. But it's something that our job is to make sure we're there to deliver what the customer wants when they want it. And we will certainly stay on track with it. In trying to predict where the customer is going, I don't think I'll get into that. But we're happy with our overall offering. We're happy with our continued growth and thrilled with the team we have working on not just the center of the store and keeping it a healthy and vibrant category but all the fresh departments around the perimeter of the store as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nScott, you've followed Kroger for a long time, and you know one of the things that we try to do is make sure we design our business model so it's successful regardless of the environment and try to really play to what's going on in the environment. And some of those examples, that's what's going on now, but customers change and we try to make sure that we stay nimble enough to be able to react to those changes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nOkay, perfect. And then I actually had a question, at the Analyst Day, you guys laid out a very compelling case about market share and how that drives returns over time and that one of the big growth drivers you see for Kroger is taking some markets that maybe are a little bit below where the ideal share is and driving them up. As I survey your business, one of those areas seems to be the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast that happen to be with Harris Teeter. How do we think about those areas geographically and what you can do to maybe get the market shares up over 20% to really drive some handsome returns?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThe -- we -- other than at the Analyst Day, we did give specifics on one market. We won't make it a habit of giving specifics, so we really do look at across all of the opportunities. When we merged with Harris Teeter, one of the things we talked about was one of the reasons we were excited about merging with Harris Teeter is the opportunities that they had in several of the markets that you mentioned. We're equally or more excited today about that opportunity going forward as when we merged with Harris Teeter. So beyond that, I won't get into any more specifics on a market, other than, as we outlined, we see this as a long-term opportunity across a lot of markets.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nSo you would -- densing up would be -- would definitely help you guys in those markets.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, it would help us in most of our markets.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes. As we've long said, the higher our market share, the higher our ROA in a particular market, and that's really the cornerstone to increasing the number of markets with that high correlation.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Forbes (Analysts)】\nIt's actually Steve on for John today. As it relates to the capital development program, is there a focus on speeding up the pace of investments here, I guess, to capitalize on some opportunities? Or should we still assume the $200 million of incremental spend annually looking out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWell, again, I won't get into what our guidance is for 2016. But we do continue to have a great pipeline of projects and are very encouraged by our early projects. We will continue to grow capital as we go into 2016 compared to 2015. The $200 million is a number that I would say, for the next several years, we would increase capital by at least that amount. Keep in mind, as I increase capital and I increase my base -- my store base and the number of stores, I also have to increase maintenance capital a little bit to keep those stores fresh over time. So it's not just an allocation -- a new allocation to new stores. I'm going to have to make sure I continue to take care of the base operations as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nAnd part of the thing that Mike talked about on speeding up, it's really our real estate teams, our facility engineering teams, our division teams and our attorneys working together to take time out of the process on how long it takes us to get a store open. So it's really everybody working together, actually taking weeks out of construction time, which is causing some of the acceleration of capital investment.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nRight.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Forbes (Analysts)】\nAnd just a follow-up. As we try to figure out, right, the impact here of the development program, can you touch or remind us of, I guess, the normal comp maturation of a marketplace or the maturation of the store-level EBITDA margin?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWhen you said the normal comp maturation, what do you mean?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Forbes (Analysts)】\nI guess, the store opens at an initial productivity of 70% or so. I mean, what is -- year 1 and year 2, right, there's going to be a benefit on the comp side. Do you see a pretty significant ramp both in comp and profitability on the store -- at the store level? Because year 1...\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nClearly, when you open a store, the first 6 to 12 months of that store opening, with all the preopening costs that get expensed on the day you open, it takes a while for that store to turn black on an EBITDA standpoint. It doesn't become a comp store until the fifth full quarter that it's open, the way we do IDs. So it's a while before they contribute to IDs. In some markets, as we dense up, you have the potential to have a little bit of sister store impact. So from a total sales standpoint, you're getting exactly what you want wanted. From an ID standpoint in a particular geography, you may have a little degradation in a particular geography from their ID sales as you dense up in a particular market. Now some of these markets, our market share is low enough where that won't be as big of a deal, but we continue to monitor that as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Wolf (Analysts)】\nOn the ID sales, I want to compare them to Q2 because it was kind of the same number both for the print and for the inflation. So I think I recall in Q2, you said it was very much volume-driven, and I'm not sure you said that here. I think I hear you talking a little bit more about mix. Should we take away from that, that, that number has a better mix element this quarter than last quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIt was heavily driven by volume again. Very strong. I just...\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes. In my prepared comments, I said it was a combination of very strong tonnage plus an increase in the number of households shopping with us and the number of visits per household during the time frame. So it's a combination of all of those.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nBut tonnage was very, very strong.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Wolf (Analysts)】\nOkay, good to hear. So there's no real update on mix, it's sort of the bifurcated message continues.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIt really is the same thing that continues to play out. But it -- now it's playing out on top of years where it played out, so it's growth on top of growth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Wolf (Analysts)】\nTwo more follow-ups. On 84.51°, you've been asked about it and you pointed to it. Can you maybe call out some areas of the marketing where it really is helping? We're used to sort of unique promotions, but is it also in pricing? And I know Vinny asked about allocation, but could you give us a high level there as to where it's currently -- is it helping the business more than it has maybe as we're used to hearing about? And also, when you announced the split from dunnhumby you said you could probably work with some -- or excited to work with similar companies. Any update there would be helpful as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes. On working with other companies, that we wouldn't share at this point other than saying that we continue -- that's something that is part of what we're allowed to do now, and we work against that. On helping more than the past, one of the things -- even some of the examples that you gave, just by continuing to learn and continuing to be more integrated, we're making progress on top of where we were. So to me, the biggest improvement and change has been, in the meetings now, the 84.51° team is part of the same meeting. So you're not having a discussion and deciding what to do and then going out -- going back and sitting down with 84.51° to say, \"Okay, here's what we want you to do.\" It's actually everybody in the same meeting and their insights to say, \"Well, you're thinking about this, but it's probably better if you think about it this way.\" And it's really the professional insights and experiences that's helping us accelerate where we are versus necessarily just doing something new.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nAnd in the past, while we owned half of them, they would have not been always around the table initially because we did only own half of them and they had obligations outside the Kroger world as well. So we have time for -- you had another follow-up?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Wolf (Analysts)】\nYes. Just real quick on the $80 million pension contribution. I assume that was contemplated in your guidance, either for the quarter or for the year. I just wanted to double check that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nIt is contemplated in the guidance, in the $2.02 to $2.04 for the year. Those are things that, with some of the strong fuel margins, rather than that happening a little bit every so often, we've taken opportunity to put the money in when we have that tailwind. It gets the money into the fund, and they can start putting it to work faster than if we did it over time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nAnd I'll just reiterate the good luck to Cindy in the pensions. And I just wanted to ask a question about relative price gaps. I feel like everywhere I turn in the industry, someone's telling me just how aggressive you're being with price. Our studies show something similar, and your gross margin is just holding up remarkably well. You talked about the mix. But I guess I'm just wondering if you could talk about how you feel about your relative price gaps. Do you think you've maintained them, widened them? What do you think the plan for next year is?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, if you look at longer term, we've always assumed that markets will get more competitive, and that's been part of our business model really starting -- Dave caused us to start that years ago, and it's something that we just couldn't [indiscernible]. And we don't see that changing at all. The gap, I guess I would word it a different way. You're always trying to get better, but you're proud of where -- the progress you've made. And it's something that's very important for us to be able to make sure that we're giving our customers a better and better deal. Price is one element of that, but service is just as important, and we're focused as much on that in terms of fresher product and better service as well. And all of those things together is what we think creates a unique model for Kroger, and it's driving a lot of our success.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nGreat, that's helpful. And then just a question on the pension contribution. It seems like -- I don't know if I'm thinking about this but -- the right way, but when you have these very strong gas margin environment that generates a little extra cash and earnings, you kind of offset that with these kind of onetime contributions. Is that the right way to think about that in terms of how you plan for these? And then just what is the status of the consolidated UFCW plan at this point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWell, the status of it, it's in great shape. Cindy will make sure it stays that way. We did joke internally that it was her going-away present from IR to the pension group, but that wasn't. We -- these funds will need money over time. The -- our enrollment in these plans continues to grow. Folks continue to earn benefits. We have a great investment strategy, but they do require funds over time. And while we would budget them in to be made at different points in time, as I said earlier, when we have the opportunity and a little bit of tailwind and a few extra dollars in the coffers, we feel it's prudent to go ahead and put that money into the fund, let the fund put that money to work as quickly as possible to generate the return and continue to have strong benefits for our associates.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThanks, Kelly. Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. As I said a few minutes ago, Kroger's consistent outstanding results are easy to take for granted. The fact is your hard work in our stores and facilities every day makes it all possible. Your commitment to our customers brings our Customer 1st Strategy to life. In large and small ways, each and every day, what you do makes these terrific results possible. \r\nThe holiday season is such a special time of the year in our stores all over the country. You help millions of customers every day prepare for celebrations at their schools, offices, churches, homes and more. Thank you for your hard work to make the holidays brighter for each of them. You also make it a season of giving by working with Feeding America, the Salvation Army and other local community partners who help work with us to donate food and other items where they are needed most. Thank you, and thank you for being part of our big Kroger family. Merry Christmas, and happy holidays to you and your family.\r\nThat completes our call today. Thanks for joining.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. \r\nToday's press release and slide presentation are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Now please turn to Slide #2 for a reminder of some upcoming 3M investor events. On March 29, we will be hosting an Investor Day at our headquarters in St. Paul. During this event, you'll have a chance to hear from a variety of 3M leaders, and we also plan to showcase our new state-of-the-art R&D technology center. We expect to introduce a new 5-year plan through the year 2020 in conjunction with this event, and I hope you can join us. Also note the dates for next year's quarterly earnings calls scheduled for January 26, April 26, July 26 and October 25.\r\nPlease take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. \r\nNow if you'd please turn to Slide 4, and I'll hand off to Inge.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning and thank you for joining us today. Today, we will lay out our outlook for 2016. But before we address next year, however, I will make some comments about the current state of 3M and how we are building a company that is positioned to drive efficient growth, both today and into the future. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 5. At 3M, we are guided by our vision, which is inspirational and something for us to reach for. Its layout: how we are striving to advance, enhance and improve every company, every home and every life. And we do that through technology, products and innovation. We complement our vision with 6 strategies, which are operationalized throughout the company. The first 4 strategies focus on growth, the fifth is around people and the last strategy is around operational excellence. Our team's relentless focus on operational excellence has been critical throughout 2015 and will continue to support our success in what we expect to be another slow growth environment in 2016.\r\nOn Slide 6, you see our entire playbook, which we are executing in order to create more value for customers and shareholders. In addition to our vision and strategies, we also have laid out 6 leadership behaviors, along with our Code of Conduct, which defines how we live and work. Our commitment to doing business the right way is constantly reinforced throughout our company. \r\nFinally, our 3 key levers, portfolio management, investing in innovation and business transformation, represent 3 big value creators for our enterprise. And I will go into more detail on those later. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 7. As always, we are focused on executing our playbook, making investments for the future and managing those things within our control: in other words, controlling the controllable. This is evident in our 2015 performance, which is marked by efficient growth and strong execution. Through 3 quarters, we have increased company-wide margins 1 full percentage point to 23.7%. Our margin strength is broad based across the portfolio, ranging from 22% in Electronics and Energy to 32% in Health Care; premium margins, our hallmark of our company, which we are able to deliver even in a low growth global economy.\r\nIn 2015, we are also generating strong free cash flow, and we expect our full year conversion rate to be approximately 100%. This is allowing us to invest in the business and also return cash to shareholders. As a reminder, our company has paid dividends for 99 consecutive years and increased that dividend for the last 57 years.\r\nPlease turn to Slide 8. The foundation of our company's history of success is our fundamental strengths and they will continue to propel us into the future. This chart illustrates a vertical and horizontal business model built around technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and brands. Our 4 fundamental strengths allow us to successfully invent, build and market products throughout our vast global network. And we are constantly investing in those capabilities to position us for success. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 9. At 3M, we are never satisfied, and we are always building strengths on strengths across our enterprise. This includes actions to increase our relevance to customers, enhance the effectiveness of our investments in research and development and expand our market presence through mergers and acquisitions. We're also taking actions to standardize global business processes and reduce structural overhead in order to move to a more efficient business model.\r\nLet's move to Slide 10. Three key levers are driving those investments and position us to win in both the short and long term. And in 2015, we have made significant progress on each of these levers. First is portfolio management, starting on Slide 11. Back in 2012, we began taking action to prioritize strengthening and focus our portfolio of businesses. We have since realigned from 6 sectors to 5 business groups and from 40 businesses to 26. This year, for example, we combined our Dental and Orthodontic businesses within our Health Care business group. Now, through a single and seamless partnership, we can offer customers array of oral care innovations. Combining and realigning businesses is delivering significant benefits including greater customer relevance, scale, productivity and, of course, improved speed. It is also making our company leaner and better positioned to allocate resources to our best opportunities as it relates to both organic growth and acquisitions. \r\nAnd on Slide 12, we will cover our recent M&A activity. An important aspect of our portfolio management is acquisitions, which complement organic growth and create greater value for our shareholders. As you see, in the last few years, we have completed a number of significant acquisitions. Most recently, in the third quarter, we finalized the acquisitions of Capital Safety and Polypore's Separations Media business. These deals will enhance 2 of 3M's core platforms, personal safety and filtration. And the integration of those businesses remains on track. \r\nAt the same time, we sell businesses that no longer fit within our portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we have closed 2 divestitures, both within our Safety and Graphics business group. Earlier in the year, we also completed the sale of our Static Control business. Ultimately, we determine that selling these businesses will result in the greatest value creation for our company.\r\nPlease turn to Slide 13. At 3M, managing and evaluating our portfolio is a constant and ongoing process. Right now, as you know, we are exploring strategic alternatives for our Health Information Systems business. This is a healthy growing business and an industry leader in healthcare coding software and analytics. Options include spinning off, selling or keeping the business. At the end of our evaluation, we will choose the best path to benefit 3M, our stakeholders and the business itself. And we anticipate the decision to be made in the end of the first quarter 2016.\r\nOur second lever is investing in innovation found on Slide 14. Research and development is the heartbeat of 3M. It fosters a constant stream of unique and cutting-edge products, which drives organic growth. R&D is also key to sustaining our company's premium margins and return on invested capital. That is why we continue to invest in R&D while strengthening our ability to leverage insight from both customers and the marketplace. These insights are key to our success, and they allow us to connect our company's 46 technology platforms to real world needs and opportunities. Just this year, we opened Customer Technical Centers in Australia, West China, Italy and Turkey, while our local teams work directly with customers and their channels. \r\nMegatrends is, of course, also a guide for our innovation. Globally, for example, rapid population growth in urban areas is creating challenges related to energy efficiency, clean water and environmental protection. So right now, we are building an urban solutions laboratory in Singapore as population growth in Southeast Asia is having a major impact. There, our local scientists will leverage our technologies to develop relevant solutions, which are unique to that region. At the same time, we are now moving scientists into our new state-of-the-art corporate research lab here in St. Paul that I hope you all can come and see in March. It will further develop and refine the company's technology platforms where we'll boost our 3M laboratories around the world. Investing in research and development is all about building strengths on strengths, so we remain a world-class scientific powerhouse.\r\nPlease turn to Slide 15. We're also moving to a more efficient business model throughout our third level, which we call business transformation. This will increase productivity while allowing us to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. The backbone is a global ERP system, and we are making good progress. Our team is currently executing our deployment plan across West Europe, and in the third quarter, we successfully rolled out in the Nordic countries. In August, we also deployed the ERP system in our new global service center located in Wroclaw, Poland. This is the first of 3 service centers we're opening globally which will optimize our delivery and transactional services, resulting in a lower cost and greater value creation. Business transformation is an important undertaking with significant long-term benefits. We expect $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and another $0.5 billion annual reduction in working capital. \r\nI wrap up my formal comments on Slide 16. As you can see, we are building, preparing and positioning 3M for an efficient growth today and into the future. As I look across our enterprise, the playbook is working. We are controlling the controllable and making investment and for long-term success. As a result, I continue to grow more confident in our enterprise, and I thank the 3M team for their contribution. \r\nNow, I would turn it over to Nick who will go through our outlook for 2016. Nick?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 18. Before I address the 2016 outlook, let me provide a few comments as we close out 2015. Global end-market demand continues to be soft as reflected in declining macroeconomic forecasts, a trend that has had a notable impact on our Industrial business, particularly in the United States. We are also seeing weaker-than-expected demand in the consumer electronics market, which is impacting our Electronics and Energy business. Therefore, today, we are updating guidance for the full year. We expect organic local currency growth to be approximately 1% versus prior guidance of 1.5% to 2%. As a result, we forecast full year GAAP earnings to be approximately $7.55 per share versus a prior range of $7.60 to $7.65. \r\nAs Inge mentioned, we now forecast a full year free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 100% versus a prior range of 95% to 100%. On the Q3 earnings call, we announced a corporate restructuring plan, which will be completed by the end of the year. This action will result in a fourth quarter pretax charge of $100 million or approximately $0.14 per share. \r\nLet's now look to 2016 starting on Slide 19. As Inge said, heading into next year, our teams will continue to be focused on executing our playbook, controlling the controllable and making investments for long-term success. We expect positive but slow economic growth in 2016. So once again, our ongoing emphasis on operational excellence will help us deliver another year of efficient growth. We expect 2016 earnings per share to grow between 7% and 12%, with approximately 80% of this growth coming from operations. \r\nAs always, investing in the business remains our top priority. This includes CapEx and R&D, which drives organic growth, as well as strategic acquisitions, which complement organic growth. At the same time, we will continue to invest in productivity to improve operational efficiency across the company. Finally, we continue to make progress to optimize our capital structure while maintaining flexibility to respond to strategic opportunities. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 20. On this slide, you see a summary of our 2016 planning estimates. We are expecting GAAP earnings to be $8.10 to $8.45 per share. This is a 7% to 12% increase in earnings per share, primarily driven by operations. We expect organic local currency growth to be 1% to 3%. Foreign currency translation will remain a headwind and reduce sales in U.S. dollars by 1% to 3%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, will add 1% to sales growth in 2016. We expect our tax rate will be 29.5% to 30.5%. Finally, we anticipate another strong year of free cash flow generation, with a conversion rate of 95% to 105%.\r\nTurn to Slide 21. Here is our 2016 capital allocation plan. We generate strong and consistent cash flow due to the strength and diversity of our business model. For 2016, we estimate $12.5 billion to $15 billion of available capital, which includes added leverage of $2 billion to $4 billion. The first priority is to invest in our businesses while, at the same time, returning significant cash to shareholders. In the following slides, I will go into more detail on each element of our 2016 earnings per share walk.\r\nPlease turn to Slide 22. Organic growth remains the primary growth metric for our company. In 2016, we expect organic growth in the range of 1% to 3%, which translates to an earnings increase of $0.10 to $0.25 per share. We expect second half growth to be stronger than first half, with growth largely driven by volumes. The first quarter comp will be the most challenging in 2016, particularly in Electronics and Energy and Safety and Graphics. For reference, we estimate that the global Industrial Production Index will grow 1% to 2% next year. In developing markets, we expect to generate organic growth of 2% to 6%, with flat to 2% growth in developed markets. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 23. Let's now look at organic growth estimates by business and geography. We expect our Health Care and Consumer businesses to lead our organic growth, with Health Care up 3% to 5% and Consumer increasing 2% to 4%. We forecast organic growth in the Electronics and Energy business to be in the range of minus 2% to plus 2%. And finally, organic growth in our Industrial-related businesses, namely Industrial and Safety and Graphics, is estimated to be flat to plus 3% in Industrial and up 1% to 3% in Safety and Graphics. \r\nBreaking the growth down by geographic region, we estimate the U.S. will grow organically between 1% and 3% next year. Organic growth in EMEA is expected to be in the range of minus 1% to plus 2%, with West Europe in the range of minus 1% to plus 1%. In Asia Pacific, we anticipate 1% to 4% organic growth, with both China and Japan in the low to mid-single-digit range. Finally, Latin America/Canada is expected to grow between 1% and 4%. \r\nNext I will walk through investments, which support and drive organic growth into the future. Let's start with CapEx on Slide 24. A strong enabler of organic growth is our continued investments in capital equipment and manufacturing process technologies. Over the past 3 years, we have specifically increased our investments in automation to advance product quality and increase productivity. We deploy CapEx in alignment with our portfolio prioritization process, thus ensuring we're investing fully in our most promising growth opportunities. Historically, our CapEx investments have been around 4.5% to 5% of sales. We expect this trend to continue during 2016, with an estimated CapEx investment of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 25. Like CapEx, R&D investments also enable us to drive efficient growth and consistently deliver premium margins and return on invested capital. As a science-based company, our ability to create unique, relevant and cutting-edge products is foundational to our success. That is why we continue to invest in R&D, even when the external environment becomes more challenging. This is a significant part of our commitment to building 3M for both short- and long-term success. In 2016, we expect to invest approximately $1.8 billion in R&D. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 26. Acquisitions and divestitures strengthen and focus our portfolio of businesses. In 2016, we expect acquisitions, net of divestitures, to add 1% to sales growth and boost earnings by approximately $0.10 per share. The sales and earnings impact is driven by the 2015 acquisitions of Ivera Medical, Polypore's Separations Media business and Capital Safety. It also includes the impact of selling our library systems and French license plate converting businesses earlier this quarter. Looking forward, the acquisition pipeline is healthy, and we are actively reviewing and prioritizing opportunities. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 27. Let's now look at the earnings impact of foreign currency. As highlighted earlier, we expect foreign currency translation to reduce sales in U.S. dollars by 1% to 3% in 2016, which will reduce earnings by $0.20 to $0.30 per share. This estimate includes the impact of foreign currency on translation and intercompany purchases, net of hedging gains. \r\nWith respect to hedging, we take 2 approaches. Our primary strategy is natural hedging. This means optimizing our supply chains and moving operations closer to our customers around the world, which naturally reduces our currency exposures. Our other strategy is financial hedging, which is meant to provide our businesses time to adjust to a sustained change in currency rates. We hedge approximately 50% of our economic exposure on a rolling 12-month basis and also have additional hedges as far out as 36 months in the most liquid currencies at gradually diminishing levels. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 28. In 2016, we anticipate raw materials to benefit earnings by $0.10 to $0.15 per share, with the majority of the savings coming in the first half. These expected savings are driven by a number of factors, most notably, market prices for many of our inputs have continued to decline, and our global sourcing teams are generating additional savings above market.\r\nPlease turn to Slide 29, where we will cover restructuring. As I mentioned earlier, we are on track to complete our corporate restructuring plan by the end of this year. We estimate these actions will increase earnings by $0.25 to $0.30 per share in 2016. The EPS impact includes the nonrecurring pretax charge of approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and pretax savings of approximately $130 million in 2016. \r\nAs a reminder, the restructuring plan is focused on structural overhead, largely in the U.S. and slower growing markets, with particular emphasis in EMEA and Latin America. These actions align with our ongoing efforts to strengthen competitiveness by becoming an even leaner, more efficient and more agile company.\r\nPlease turn to Slide 30. Driving productivity each and every day is a way of life at 3M. On top of the restructuring savings, we expect additional productivity efforts to contribute up to $0.10 to earnings per share in 2016. We estimate that approximately half of the additional productivity benefit will come from business transformation. We also continue to drive Lean Six Sigma company-wide, with emphasis in our manufacturing operations and global supply chains. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 31. During 2016, we expect strategic investments to reduce earnings by $0.15 to $0.20 per share. A part of our business model is to continuously reinvest in the business to enable even more growth and productivity. These investments will support ongoing portfolio efforts to enhance our ability to serve markets and customers while also streamlining and simplifying operations. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 32. Pension will become an earnings tailwind in 2016 in the range of $0.25 to $0.35 per share. 2/3 of the benefit is due to the adoption of the spot rate method for accounting purposes. This method is considered to be more precise in measuring pension service and interest costs. The other 1/3 is driven by increased interest rates year-on-year and design changes to postretirement benefit plans. We estimate year-end 2015 worldwide pension/OPEB funded status will be 85%, with the U.S. pension plan at 91%. 2016 cash contributions to our defined benefit plans are expected to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million, similar to recent years. We have closed most of our defined benefit pension plans around the world and have migrated to defined contribution plans to meet changing employee preferences for greater flexibility and portability. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 33. Let's now discuss 2016 net interest expense. As I mentioned, we continue to make progress to better optimize our capital structure and lower our cost of capital. As part of that plan in 2015, we will add approximately $4 billion of debt. In 2016, we expect to add an additional $2 billion to $4 billion of leverage, which is net of $1 billion of debt refinancing. As a result, we expect net interest expense will go up in 2016, reducing earnings by $0.10 to $0.15 per share. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 34. Regarding taxes, we anticipate our tax rate to be between 29.5% and 30.5% in 2016. This will result in an earnings headwind of minus $0.05 to minus $0.15 per share. We continue to optimize our supply chain and utilize centers of excellence to increase efficiency and to drive down the structural tax rate. These efforts are being offset by the strong U.S. dollar, which has shifted a greater portion of earnings into the U.S. Our tax rate guidance assumes renewal of the R&D tax credit in 2016, consistent with our assumption for 2015. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 35. Finally, let me wrap up my formal comments by covering cash returns to shareholders. 3M has a long history of paying dividends. In 2015, we increased the dividend by 20%, which was on top of a 35% increase in 2014. As a result, we have increased our dividend payout ratio to approximately 54% this year, up from 37% in 2012. Looking ahead, we expect the dividend to grow in line with earnings over time. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 36. For 2016, we are forecasting to deploy $4 billion to $6 billion of cash toward growth share repurchases or $3 billion to $5 billion net of reissuances. This will reduce average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 4%, which will increase earnings by $0.25 to $0.35 per share.\r\nPlease turn to Slide 37, where I will recap our EPS road map. This slide shows all the components of our EPS expectations for 2016, which I just covered. As you can see, we expect earnings growth to be driven primarily by operations as our team continues to execute our plan and control the controllable.\r\nPlease turn to Slide 38. In summary, we are positioned for a successful 2016, including strong earnings growth in the face of a challenging global economy. Equally important, we will continue to make investments to strengthen our foundation for long-term success. \r\nThank you for your attention. We will now open up the meeting for Q&A.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Matthew Ginter (Executives)】\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. \r\nToday's press release and slide presentation are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Now please turn to Slide #2 for a reminder of some upcoming 3M investor events. On March 29, we will be hosting an Investor Day at our headquarters in St. Paul. During this event, you'll have a chance to hear from a variety of 3M leaders, and we also plan to showcase our new state-of-the-art R&D technology center. We expect to introduce a new 5-year plan through the year 2020 in conjunction with this event, and I hope you can join us. Also note the dates for next year's quarterly earnings calls scheduled for January 26, April 26, July 26 and October 25.\r\nPlease take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. \r\nNow if you'd please turn to Slide 4, and I'll hand off to Inge.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nThank you, Matt, and good morning and thank you for joining us today. Today, we will lay out our outlook for 2016. But before we address next year, however, I will make some comments about the current state of 3M and how we are building a company that is positioned to drive efficient growth, both today and into the future. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 5. At 3M, we are guided by our vision, which is inspirational and something for us to reach for. Its layout: how we are striving to advance, enhance and improve every company, every home and every life. And we do that through technology, products and innovation. We complement our vision with 6 strategies, which are operationalized throughout the company. The first 4 strategies focus on growth, the fifth is around people and the last strategy is around operational excellence. Our team's relentless focus on operational excellence has been critical throughout 2015 and will continue to support our success in what we expect to be another slow growth environment in 2016.\r\nOn Slide 6, you see our entire playbook, which we are executing in order to create more value for customers and shareholders. In addition to our vision and strategies, we also have laid out 6 leadership behaviors, along with our Code of Conduct, which defines how we live and work. Our commitment to doing business the right way is constantly reinforced throughout our company. \r\nFinally, our 3 key levers, portfolio management, investing in innovation and business transformation, represent 3 big value creators for our enterprise. And I will go into more detail on those later. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 7. As always, we are focused on executing our playbook, making investments for the future and managing those things within our control: in other words, controlling the controllable. This is evident in our 2015 performance, which is marked by efficient growth and strong execution. Through 3 quarters, we have increased company-wide margins 1 full percentage point to 23.7%. Our margin strength is broad based across the portfolio, ranging from 22% in Electronics and Energy to 32% in Health Care; premium margins, our hallmark of our company, which we are able to deliver even in a low growth global economy.\r\nIn 2015, we are also generating strong free cash flow, and we expect our full year conversion rate to be approximately 100%. This is allowing us to invest in the business and also return cash to shareholders. As a reminder, our company has paid dividends for 99 consecutive years and increased that dividend for the last 57 years.\r\nPlease turn to Slide 8. The foundation of our company's history of success is our fundamental strengths and they will continue to propel us into the future. This chart illustrates a vertical and horizontal business model built around technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and brands. Our 4 fundamental strengths allow us to successfully invent, build and market products throughout our vast global network. And we are constantly investing in those capabilities to position us for success. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 9. At 3M, we are never satisfied, and we are always building strengths on strengths across our enterprise. This includes actions to increase our relevance to customers, enhance the effectiveness of our investments in research and development and expand our market presence through mergers and acquisitions. We're also taking actions to standardize global business processes and reduce structural overhead in order to move to a more efficient business model.\r\nLet's move to Slide 10. Three key levers are driving those investments and position us to win in both the short and long term. And in 2015, we have made significant progress on each of these levers. First is portfolio management, starting on Slide 11. Back in 2012, we began taking action to prioritize strengthening and focus our portfolio of businesses. We have since realigned from 6 sectors to 5 business groups and from 40 businesses to 26. This year, for example, we combined our Dental and Orthodontic businesses within our Health Care business group. Now, through a single and seamless partnership, we can offer customers array of oral care innovations. Combining and realigning businesses is delivering significant benefits including greater customer relevance, scale, productivity and, of course, improved speed. It is also making our company leaner and better positioned to allocate resources to our best opportunities as it relates to both organic growth and acquisitions. \r\nAnd on Slide 12, we will cover our recent M&A activity. An important aspect of our portfolio management is acquisitions, which complement organic growth and create greater value for our shareholders. As you see, in the last few years, we have completed a number of significant acquisitions. Most recently, in the third quarter, we finalized the acquisitions of Capital Safety and Polypore's Separations Media business. These deals will enhance 2 of 3M's core platforms, personal safety and filtration. And the integration of those businesses remains on track. \r\nAt the same time, we sell businesses that no longer fit within our portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we have closed 2 divestitures, both within our Safety and Graphics business group. Earlier in the year, we also completed the sale of our Static Control business. Ultimately, we determine that selling these businesses will result in the greatest value creation for our company.\r\nPlease turn to Slide 13. At 3M, managing and evaluating our portfolio is a constant and ongoing process. Right now, as you know, we are exploring strategic alternatives for our Health Information Systems business. This is a healthy growing business and an industry leader in healthcare coding software and analytics. Options include spinning off, selling or keeping the business. At the end of our evaluation, we will choose the best path to benefit 3M, our stakeholders and the business itself. And we anticipate the decision to be made in the end of the first quarter 2016.\r\nOur second lever is investing in innovation found on Slide 14. Research and development is the heartbeat of 3M. It fosters a constant stream of unique and cutting-edge products, which drives organic growth. R&D is also key to sustaining our company's premium margins and return on invested capital. That is why we continue to invest in R&D while strengthening our ability to leverage insight from both customers and the marketplace. These insights are key to our success, and they allow us to connect our company's 46 technology platforms to real world needs and opportunities. Just this year, we opened Customer Technical Centers in Australia, West China, Italy and Turkey, while our local teams work directly with customers and their channels. \r\nMegatrends is, of course, also a guide for our innovation. Globally, for example, rapid population growth in urban areas is creating challenges related to energy efficiency, clean water and environmental protection. So right now, we are building an urban solutions laboratory in Singapore as population growth in Southeast Asia is having a major impact. There, our local scientists will leverage our technologies to develop relevant solutions, which are unique to that region. At the same time, we are now moving scientists into our new state-of-the-art corporate research lab here in St. Paul that I hope you all can come and see in March. It will further develop and refine the company's technology platforms where we'll boost our 3M laboratories around the world. Investing in research and development is all about building strengths on strengths, so we remain a world-class scientific powerhouse.\r\nPlease turn to Slide 15. We're also moving to a more efficient business model throughout our third level, which we call business transformation. This will increase productivity while allowing us to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. The backbone is a global ERP system, and we are making good progress. Our team is currently executing our deployment plan across West Europe, and in the third quarter, we successfully rolled out in the Nordic countries. In August, we also deployed the ERP system in our new global service center located in Wroclaw, Poland. This is the first of 3 service centers we're opening globally which will optimize our delivery and transactional services, resulting in a lower cost and greater value creation. Business transformation is an important undertaking with significant long-term benefits. We expect $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and another $0.5 billion annual reduction in working capital. \r\nI wrap up my formal comments on Slide 16. As you can see, we are building, preparing and positioning 3M for an efficient growth today and into the future. As I look across our enterprise, the playbook is working. We are controlling the controllable and making investment and for long-term success. As a result, I continue to grow more confident in our enterprise, and I thank the 3M team for their contribution. \r\nNow, I would turn it over to Nick who will go through our outlook for 2016. Nick?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nThank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 18. Before I address the 2016 outlook, let me provide a few comments as we close out 2015. Global end-market demand continues to be soft as reflected in declining macroeconomic forecasts, a trend that has had a notable impact on our Industrial business, particularly in the United States. We are also seeing weaker-than-expected demand in the consumer electronics market, which is impacting our Electronics and Energy business. Therefore, today, we are updating guidance for the full year. We expect organic local currency growth to be approximately 1% versus prior guidance of 1.5% to 2%. As a result, we forecast full year GAAP earnings to be approximately $7.55 per share versus a prior range of $7.60 to $7.65. \r\nAs Inge mentioned, we now forecast a full year free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 100% versus a prior range of 95% to 100%. On the Q3 earnings call, we announced a corporate restructuring plan, which will be completed by the end of the year. This action will result in a fourth quarter pretax charge of $100 million or approximately $0.14 per share. \r\nLet's now look to 2016 starting on Slide 19. As Inge said, heading into next year, our teams will continue to be focused on executing our playbook, controlling the controllable and making investments for long-term success. We expect positive but slow economic growth in 2016. So once again, our ongoing emphasis on operational excellence will help us deliver another year of efficient growth. We expect 2016 earnings per share to grow between 7% and 12%, with approximately 80% of this growth coming from operations. \r\nAs always, investing in the business remains our top priority. This includes CapEx and R&D, which drives organic growth, as well as strategic acquisitions, which complement organic growth. At the same time, we will continue to invest in productivity to improve operational efficiency across the company. Finally, we continue to make progress to optimize our capital structure while maintaining flexibility to respond to strategic opportunities. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 20. On this slide, you see a summary of our 2016 planning estimates. We are expecting GAAP earnings to be $8.10 to $8.45 per share. This is a 7% to 12% increase in earnings per share, primarily driven by operations. We expect organic local currency growth to be 1% to 3%. Foreign currency translation will remain a headwind and reduce sales in U.S. dollars by 1% to 3%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, will add 1% to sales growth in 2016. We expect our tax rate will be 29.5% to 30.5%. Finally, we anticipate another strong year of free cash flow generation, with a conversion rate of 95% to 105%.\r\nTurn to Slide 21. Here is our 2016 capital allocation plan. We generate strong and consistent cash flow due to the strength and diversity of our business model. For 2016, we estimate $12.5 billion to $15 billion of available capital, which includes added leverage of $2 billion to $4 billion. The first priority is to invest in our businesses while, at the same time, returning significant cash to shareholders. In the following slides, I will go into more detail on each element of our 2016 earnings per share walk.\r\nPlease turn to Slide 22. Organic growth remains the primary growth metric for our company. In 2016, we expect organic growth in the range of 1% to 3%, which translates to an earnings increase of $0.10 to $0.25 per share. We expect second half growth to be stronger than first half, with growth largely driven by volumes. The first quarter comp will be the most challenging in 2016, particularly in Electronics and Energy and Safety and Graphics. For reference, we estimate that the global Industrial Production Index will grow 1% to 2% next year. In developing markets, we expect to generate organic growth of 2% to 6%, with flat to 2% growth in developed markets. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 23. Let's now look at organic growth estimates by business and geography. We expect our Health Care and Consumer businesses to lead our organic growth, with Health Care up 3% to 5% and Consumer increasing 2% to 4%. We forecast organic growth in the Electronics and Energy business to be in the range of minus 2% to plus 2%. And finally, organic growth in our Industrial-related businesses, namely Industrial and Safety and Graphics, is estimated to be flat to plus 3% in Industrial and up 1% to 3% in Safety and Graphics. \r\nBreaking the growth down by geographic region, we estimate the U.S. will grow organically between 1% and 3% next year. Organic growth in EMEA is expected to be in the range of minus 1% to plus 2%, with West Europe in the range of minus 1% to plus 1%. In Asia Pacific, we anticipate 1% to 4% organic growth, with both China and Japan in the low to mid-single-digit range. Finally, Latin America/Canada is expected to grow between 1% and 4%. \r\nNext I will walk through investments, which support and drive organic growth into the future. Let's start with CapEx on Slide 24. A strong enabler of organic growth is our continued investments in capital equipment and manufacturing process technologies. Over the past 3 years, we have specifically increased our investments in automation to advance product quality and increase productivity. We deploy CapEx in alignment with our portfolio prioritization process, thus ensuring we're investing fully in our most promising growth opportunities. Historically, our CapEx investments have been around 4.5% to 5% of sales. We expect this trend to continue during 2016, with an estimated CapEx investment of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 25. Like CapEx, R&D investments also enable us to drive efficient growth and consistently deliver premium margins and return on invested capital. As a science-based company, our ability to create unique, relevant and cutting-edge products is foundational to our success. That is why we continue to invest in R&D, even when the external environment becomes more challenging. This is a significant part of our commitment to building 3M for both short- and long-term success. In 2016, we expect to invest approximately $1.8 billion in R&D. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 26. Acquisitions and divestitures strengthen and focus our portfolio of businesses. In 2016, we expect acquisitions, net of divestitures, to add 1% to sales growth and boost earnings by approximately $0.10 per share. The sales and earnings impact is driven by the 2015 acquisitions of Ivera Medical, Polypore's Separations Media business and Capital Safety. It also includes the impact of selling our library systems and French license plate converting businesses earlier this quarter. Looking forward, the acquisition pipeline is healthy, and we are actively reviewing and prioritizing opportunities. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 27. Let's now look at the earnings impact of foreign currency. As highlighted earlier, we expect foreign currency translation to reduce sales in U.S. dollars by 1% to 3% in 2016, which will reduce earnings by $0.20 to $0.30 per share. This estimate includes the impact of foreign currency on translation and intercompany purchases, net of hedging gains. \r\nWith respect to hedging, we take 2 approaches. Our primary strategy is natural hedging. This means optimizing our supply chains and moving operations closer to our customers around the world, which naturally reduces our currency exposures. Our other strategy is financial hedging, which is meant to provide our businesses time to adjust to a sustained change in currency rates. We hedge approximately 50% of our economic exposure on a rolling 12-month basis and also have additional hedges as far out as 36 months in the most liquid currencies at gradually diminishing levels. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 28. In 2016, we anticipate raw materials to benefit earnings by $0.10 to $0.15 per share, with the majority of the savings coming in the first half. These expected savings are driven by a number of factors, most notably, market prices for many of our inputs have continued to decline, and our global sourcing teams are generating additional savings above market.\r\nPlease turn to Slide 29, where we will cover restructuring. As I mentioned earlier, we are on track to complete our corporate restructuring plan by the end of this year. We estimate these actions will increase earnings by $0.25 to $0.30 per share in 2016. The EPS impact includes the nonrecurring pretax charge of approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and pretax savings of approximately $130 million in 2016. \r\nAs a reminder, the restructuring plan is focused on structural overhead, largely in the U.S. and slower growing markets, with particular emphasis in EMEA and Latin America. These actions align with our ongoing efforts to strengthen competitiveness by becoming an even leaner, more efficient and more agile company.\r\nPlease turn to Slide 30. Driving productivity each and every day is a way of life at 3M. On top of the restructuring savings, we expect additional productivity efforts to contribute up to $0.10 to earnings per share in 2016. We estimate that approximately half of the additional productivity benefit will come from business transformation. We also continue to drive Lean Six Sigma company-wide, with emphasis in our manufacturing operations and global supply chains. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 31. During 2016, we expect strategic investments to reduce earnings by $0.15 to $0.20 per share. A part of our business model is to continuously reinvest in the business to enable even more growth and productivity. These investments will support ongoing portfolio efforts to enhance our ability to serve markets and customers while also streamlining and simplifying operations. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 32. Pension will become an earnings tailwind in 2016 in the range of $0.25 to $0.35 per share. 2/3 of the benefit is due to the adoption of the spot rate method for accounting purposes. This method is considered to be more precise in measuring pension service and interest costs. The other 1/3 is driven by increased interest rates year-on-year and design changes to postretirement benefit plans. We estimate year-end 2015 worldwide pension/OPEB funded status will be 85%, with the U.S. pension plan at 91%. 2016 cash contributions to our defined benefit plans are expected to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million, similar to recent years. We have closed most of our defined benefit pension plans around the world and have migrated to defined contribution plans to meet changing employee preferences for greater flexibility and portability. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 33. Let's now discuss 2016 net interest expense. As I mentioned, we continue to make progress to better optimize our capital structure and lower our cost of capital. As part of that plan in 2015, we will add approximately $4 billion of debt. In 2016, we expect to add an additional $2 billion to $4 billion of leverage, which is net of $1 billion of debt refinancing. As a result, we expect net interest expense will go up in 2016, reducing earnings by $0.10 to $0.15 per share. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 34. Regarding taxes, we anticipate our tax rate to be between 29.5% and 30.5% in 2016. This will result in an earnings headwind of minus $0.05 to minus $0.15 per share. We continue to optimize our supply chain and utilize centers of excellence to increase efficiency and to drive down the structural tax rate. These efforts are being offset by the strong U.S. dollar, which has shifted a greater portion of earnings into the U.S. Our tax rate guidance assumes renewal of the R&D tax credit in 2016, consistent with our assumption for 2015. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 35. Finally, let me wrap up my formal comments by covering cash returns to shareholders. 3M has a long history of paying dividends. In 2015, we increased the dividend by 20%, which was on top of a 35% increase in 2014. As a result, we have increased our dividend payout ratio to approximately 54% this year, up from 37% in 2012. Looking ahead, we expect the dividend to grow in line with earnings over time. \r\nPlease turn to Slide 36. For 2016, we are forecasting to deploy $4 billion to $6 billion of cash toward growth share repurchases or $3 billion to $5 billion net of reissuances. This will reduce average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 4%, which will increase earnings by $0.25 to $0.35 per share.\r\nPlease turn to Slide 37, where I will recap our EPS road map. This slide shows all the components of our EPS expectations for 2016, which I just covered. As you can see, we expect earnings growth to be driven primarily by operations as our team continues to execute our plan and control the controllable.\r\nPlease turn to Slide 38. In summary, we are positioned for a successful 2016, including strong earnings growth in the face of a challenging global economy. Equally important, we will continue to make investments to strengthen our foundation for long-term success. \r\nThank you for your attention. We will now open up the meeting for Q&A.",
      "transcript_text3": "Yes, a 2-part question. So the first question, just lowering guidance. We still haven't finished Q4. Can you just be more specific as to where are you seeing headwinds, specifically by geographies or markets?\n\n---\n\nYes, Andrew. As I said earlier, it does reflect the reality globally of what we're seeing. We're seeing particular weakness in industrial-related businesses in the United States, and we're also seeing weaker-than-expected demand in consumer electronics. For the quarter, we're estimating organic growth in Electronics and Energy to be down high single digits, and we're estimating Industrial and Safety and Graphics to be down low single digits. Our Health Care and Consumer businesses are continuing -- we're continuing to see good performance, Andrew.\n\n---\n\nAnd just another question if I understood correctly. So you had your '13 to '17 5-year plan, and you're talking about rolling out new plan in 2016. So does that mean we're sort of scrapping -- going to scrap the old 5-year plan and just going to roll out new targets if -- am I understanding this correctly, sorry?\n\n---\n\nWell, we were talking about the new 5-year plan, right. And as you recall, the way we lay out the plan in 2012 with the targets around free cash flow conversion, return on invested capital, EPS growth and organic growth, I think we are on track relative to that plan, generally speaking, with a couple of metrics actually ahead. Free cash flow conversion and return on invested capital, we are ahead on that. And then I would say we go -- maybe we'll be, as you look forward now, as to what have changed a little bit, have been more of a challenge for most people around growth as you know, right. So I think it's time for us to look upon the target as we move ahead, and I think March is a good time for us to do that. With that said, I'm personally very pleased with how we're operating and the way the playbook is working and so forth. So it's -- but I think specifically, around the growth portion, right, if you -- the expectation in 2012, way back then, was slightly different than it is today, right. And we can even see some changes around the world just the last year or maybe the last 6 months. As you know, if you look upon what was expected then from developing world versus what we see and developed world versus what we see, right. So we have all been around long enough to see there've been a shift in the last 3 years. And I think we just would like to make sure we all understand it and that we put the resources in the right place and you guys also know what to expect from us as we move forward. I am very encouraged about the plan that is in place and executed. But we have made some shifts, positive shifts, I would say in our portfolio as well, right. So we have done all this work that we have done the last 3 years. I think to take a new look at the plan and talk to you guys about it, I think is appropriate to do.\n\n---\n\nJust wanted to start off with a question on the geographic outlook. So maybe, Nick, you've a bit more color on Q4 if the U.S. is the only region that's down in sales year-on-year or were there other regions as well? And then on the 2016 geographic outlook, I was intrigued you talked about China growing. So is that just on the assumption that there's a sharp sort of step change sometime early next year? And also in EMEA, you had a down number there at the bottom end of the range, even though EMEA seems to have been a fairly steady performance recently. So any color on that?\n\n---\n\nWell, this is Inge. I think, first of all to -- if you look upon 2016 and the outlook, you know this -- it's -- you talked about China, yes, we have China and Japan actually low to mid-single-digit growth. And I was recently in China and I would say there is, of course, growth, right. You have just to prioritize right and execute the plan, and I don't think, generally speaking, that -- you talked about the step change, I don't know if there's step change. This is the second biggest economy in the world. There is growth, generally speaking, specifically, it's what I would call, domestic businesses. And by definition, our penetration is low. So we should grow there. No doubt about it and our plan is good, right. Our plan is good, and we are prioritized right there. I think if you just talk about next year, I think that Latin America and Canada, we talked about 1% to 4%, I think in that part of the world, in Latin America specifically, they will do okay, driven by Mexico. I think Brazil still will be a challenge, and I think we have to think about that for may be 1 -- eventually 2 more years before Brazil will come back to how we remember Brazil in the past. And then we have to see what is happening in West Europe. And I will say that you heard here that we talk about it type of on the low end, of course. And there is a lot of political things that are going on that is -- may putting some, I would say, uncertainty in a way. Now, again, my view is West Europe is a very sophisticated market. They are driving a lot of technology advancements there, which is good for 3M. So there will not be a stellar growth, but we are there and we will capitalize on what we can do. Just to your first point relative to the last quarter here, I think as Nick said, we see a slowdown, what I think is more the global sentiment in consumer electronics. And I think we all have seen some reports coming out lately that if you go the whole way from smartphones to tablets and TVs, there is a small downturn in that. And my view, temporarily, because we know that's a cyclical business and it will come back again. And for me personally, I'm very pleased with the work that we have done in Electronics and Energy business group in order to optimize our portfolio and are able to deliver very robust and good margin, despite that we will see a downturn in volume for 1 or 2 quarters, right. So I don't know if you recall that we were running that business at 15.7% at the time. And I think this year, you will be very pleased when you see the end result relative to margins. So I'm very pleased with that business in the way we operate. Now, we would like to see more growth all the time, but that's type of the nature of that business. So I hope that helps.\n\n---\n\nYes, that does. And then just my second question would be on pricing. If you exclude the sort of the FX adjustment impact, how you feel about pricing entering 2016 versus how you felt about pricing power, say, 6 or 12 months ago?\n\n---\n\nJulian, the -- when we strip out FX, our core pricing, excluding pricing actions we take in reaction to FX movements, that core has been, over a period of years, in the 30 to 50 basis point range. It's probably been in -- about at a 30 basis point range for 2015, and we think that range is about right for us going forward into 2016. We're not seeing a change on that front, Julian.\n\n---\n\nThis is George Zhao on for Steve. As you put together your 2016 organic growth forecast, how much of the business would you say you have a decent visibility into, distribution or direct sales, rather than looking at IPI or other macro forecasts?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think it all depends on the different business groups. As you know, some -- if you think about 3M, we have a lot of business that are spec-ed and design-in, and then you have type of the, I would say, consumables, right. So I think on the spec and design-in, we have a very good view on it. And on consumables, maybe some time, we are 1 or 2 layers back. But I would say that we have pretty good -- pretty good visibility in the different businesses relative to inventory situations. And as a combination, as you know, of facts and some are, right, relative to the connection into the different business groups. So you take that, and you -- I don't think anyone, to be honest, will have a total picture of it, at any company. I've never met anyone that can tell me in total how it look like. And so I think it's a combination of you feel the fabric of the business, and then, you, of course, look upon the growth rate that is estimated in the marketplace, which is a strong indicator, if you like, relative to how we should plan moving forward. So I think it's a combination of science and art, to be honest.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, Nick, I'm trying to piece together your OEM margin assumptions for next year, given the EPS walk and getting close to 60 basis points. Am I in the right ballpark there? And could you provide some more color on that margin assumption?\n\n---\n\nYes, George, I'll go through that in a little more detail from a margin perspective. 2016 will be another year where we're expecting margin enhancement. At the midpoint of our guidance, that would assume that we're at approximately 150 basis points of margin expansion for 2016. So -- and the drivers of that margin expansion year-on-year is our restructuring that we've covered, both the impact to 2015 and to 2016; pension; the additional productivity; price raw material benefit; and to some extent, volume, depending on where we are in that 1% to 3% range for organic growth. And that will be partially offset. Our margin headwinds next year will be -- are the strategic investments I talked about, as well as FX; that we see FX becoming -- reducing our margin in 2016.\n\n---\n\nSo I guess my first question is really maybe talking a little bit about the organic growth cadence in next year first half versus second half, given that we're going to be exiting 4Q with negative organic growth. Just curious how you see organic growth stepping up or down next year.\n\n---\n\nYes. Joe, first of all, I did say earlier, we expect the first half to be more challenging for growth than the second half, or that we expect higher organic growth in the second half. If I get even more specific, the first quarter of 2016 will be having our most challenging comp. Organic growth in the first quarter of 2015 was 3.3%. And within that, we had our Electronics and Energy with high growth. The Electronics business in the first quarter was up 10%. So that's creating a challenging comp for us in the first quarter. We're anticipating that total company organic growth could be slightly negative in the first quarter, with increasing growth as we progress through the year.\n\n---\n\nGreat. That's helpful color, Nick. Maybe kind of switching gears a little bit to the balance sheet. The $2 billion to $4 billion in incremental debt in 2016, I think puts your gross leverage closer to 2x. And so, I guess, I'm just wondering with the capital allocation plans that you have moving forward, how much more capacity do you have to maintain your credit rating today?\n\n---\n\nJoe, this has been part of a journey that we announced a couple of years ago about better optimizing our capital structure. We've been making progress on that as we've added leverage in the last couple of -- the last few years to our balance sheet. And just to put your question in context, as we think about that, it's not so much managing to a particular debt rating, but if your question is if we add significant leverage from this point forward and whether we have the capacity or appetite to do that, we would consider that for the right strategic opportunity. And by right strategic opportunity, it'd be a large strategic value-enhancing acquisition that would be the most likely. Nothing like that contemplated now. But we have added leverage. We're clearly adding leverage in 2016. Beyond that, we'll talk in a little more depth on that in our 2020 plan outlook that we share late in March, Joe.\n\n---\n\nCan I have follow-up on the West Europe guidance? It seems like sort of through the year here, you guys were hoping to and maybe encouraged by some of the things you were seeing in West Europe, and now we're sort of guiding a minus 1%, plus 1%. Have you seen things take a step back there? Or maybe, Inge, talk about some of those points of caution that you're referencing?\n\n---\n\nYes, if we go back to the beginning of the year and you think about the currency effects, et cetera, I think that all of us at that point in time had a view that, specifically, export will accelerate out from West Europe. If you recall that type of thesis, that was an external view. It did not really happen, right. And I think it was a combination of maybe not the best execution of the European businesses. I'm not talking 3M; I'm talking about the business environment over there and some other challenges that happened specifically in Germany, I think, right, which is more a bigger issue both politically and around some of the companies there that went into some challenging situations. So -- and I would say that the latest things that happened here on November 13 in Paris is, of course, for all of us, may be tempering down of how will it look like for 2016. So for us, again, is to say that we are looking for margin expansion. We are planning for a situation where it will be slow growth, right. And I think the best thing to do when you plan is to make sure that you are more conservative in an environment like that than type of living on hope. I mean, hope is not a strategy, right. And so, I think you have to be cautious relative to how 2016 will be. And then, hopefully, it will be better. But I think it's important for us as we are driving for efficient growth, is to make sure that if your plan is that you now make sure that your structure is as lean as possible, that you take out as much layer in management as you can and focus in on execution in the front-end in terms of sales and marketing a commercial decision. Because, as you know, it's different languages over there, there are some cases that are even different currencies, so you need to be strong in the front. And then, be very aggressive relative to your corporate structure, which we are and been for quite some time. And so I will say for me, around West Europe, the outlook on growth is what it is. We need to do better whatever the growth rate is coming out of the countries. And then, it will be all about margin expansion. And we have the lowest margin in West Europe of any entity in 3M. And that's also why we do a lot over there relative to our supply chain optimization and our service center that we opened up in Poland, et cetera. So big focus in West Europe on efficiency and whatever growth will come, we will take it.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then on the higher R&D and some of these other strategic investments you're making, where are we now in terms of the payoff from those things? What are you seeing? I mean when you first started to take that R&D up, the idea was to increase more in basic research with the idea of trying to get some more breakthrough-type product, which obviously would take a little longer. Where are we on that now? What are you seeing kind of come through the system?\n\n---\n\nYes, so first of all, you see that we are coming 5.8% in R&D investment as we speak. If you take that whole initiative, if you just make a summary for you where we started, we have had 30 programs started; we have 19 that we started out in '13; we have 7 in '14; and we have 4 in '15. And I would say that of all those, 7 have been discontinued, right. Seven of them said, \"Hey, this will not work.\" So I feel good about 13, 7 out in the process, which is, for me, an indication of productivity is coming big time to research and development as well. We invested $40 million in '13. We have total up to 2014, we have had $100 million invested and we had 7 programs now that have been in early stages of execution. So I will say that I am pleased with that initiative, and as you know, it's about disruptive technologies. So we take longer time. But I'm pleased what I'm seeing and strange as it is sometimes, you're also pleased to see that we, in fact, stop something early, which I said we have stopped or discontinued 7 of the programs. So I think that you should think about it that we had sales in this year around -- from those programs around $200 million. And I think it will be double that by '16, like $400 million. So you have a $400 million sales by '16 on that initiative, which is a long-term initiative, right. So for me to get $400 million by '16 is okay. It's okay. I'm never happy, as you know. So I would say it's okay, but I'm pleased with the evolution of that.\n\n---\n\nOn the 2016 EPS walk. I was hoping to get some additional color on some of the assumptions that went into 2 of the buckets. The additional productivity, so what kinds of investments are being made there and some specifics? And then also, under the strategic investments, what are -- is the ERP system in there? What are -- is there anything that's discretionary that you might be able to roll back later in the year?\n\n---\n\nDeane, I'll cover the additional productivity piece. And for that, I put a range of $0.00 to $0.10 and those are on top of everything that we're getting for productivity in 2016 from the restructuring that we're doing in 2015. About half of that is coming from our business transformation. And by business transformation, the efforts we're doing there, where we're working on our changing and standardizing our global business process implementing ERP to improve our customer service and responsiveness. We're also establishing global service centers, Inge talked about one of those being deployed. That's a big part of that productivity. Some of the CapEx that I talked about in the past where we're investing in automation, that's also part of the productivity, the additional productivity. The Lean Six Sigma efforts that we have been putting in and continue to increase our efforts on. And all of that additional productivity, Deane, is net of any kind of inflation we see on wages. So this is productivity that more than offsets wage inflation.\n\n---\n\nAnd to the other piece there, you have to look upon that, that they are investments that will support our ongoing portfolio efforts. And I would say to enhance the ability to serve our markets better. So we put that aside in order to make sure as we go that we can take action in order to improve productivity and we speak and could be a smaller factory somewhere that we will consolidate in one way or the other, or just to have the flexibility to make those investments as we move ahead, as we strengthen the portfolio I would say. And then we have done, as you know, for the last couple of years, we have taken pieces of it here and there, including business transformation as you talked about. But we're coming to a different point now on business transformation. So we say it will now go more to strengthen the portfolio as we move ahead.\n\n---\n\nAnd just 1 follow-up: Are you contemplating additional potential divestitures from the portfolio similar to what's being looked at on health information systems?\n\n---\n\nWell, portfolio management is an ongoing process, as you know. So I would say that we are constantly evaluating our self pieces of the portfolio if it will create more value inside or outside of 3M. But you also know that we are very dependent on our technologies in order to drive certain businesses. So I think that's an important element to think about. So I will say that what we had at that -- I think the interesting thing here, Deane, is to say that when we worked on that category under Strategic Review that started $2.5 billion, they were businesses that were underperforming versus the average of 3M, 1 very good business is that one I addressed. Health information system is different, right. So that's more a question of can we, in our business model, create additional value for you and for us versus doing it in a different way. But I don't think there is anything else in front of me at this point in time for consideration. I've not seen it, so it's not that.\n\n---\n\nInge, can you just maybe step back a little bit? Obviously, we're in a very unusual economic environment here. I just wonder what gives you confidence that we're not in the early innings of something more negative than you've put forth for 2016. And kind of what are you looking at to kind of recalibrate that forecast as things kind of play out here the next several months? Are there a couple of indicators -- external indicators or dynamics in your business that you're really looking to for kind of a clue on where this global economy is actually headed?\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, we base a lot of our assumptions, of course, on external facts and data that is coming towards us. And then we often temper that down because we know often we're coming out that is slightly optimistic in the beginning. And I think we have facts on that as well, that as the quarters and years are going, it's all tempering down if it's IPI, Industrial Production Index or GDP. But then, in addition to that, there is an important element is to, in the monthly and quarterly meetings that we have with the division, get the feeling of what is going on in their specific markets. And then, all the trips that I do personally in order to travel around to different parts of the world in order to get the feeling for it, I will say that I don't, at this point in time, see anything that is indicating for me that it will be much, much slower as we move into '16. So I think what you see here is realistic based on the information that I have at hand at this point in time. I think that the change may be, as we indicated here, is maybe on the consumer electronic part where you saw other indication coming out earlier this week or end of last week, where it looked like smartphones, tablets and even TVs in that space, and I think also into semiconductor, had slowed a little bit. But reality is that those businesses go in a cycle, and they will turn around again. And as I said earlier on another question, me, myself, I'm very pleased with the work we have done in that business now to have a structure in place where we can produce and deliver very good margins even in a downturn. But I would say I've been around here the last quarter to most parts around the world and, generally speaking, you would say that there is -- there will be positive growth and there is growth opportunities. I think it's up to us with the portfolio work we have done, and I'm talking now portfolio work on a local level in each country, to go after those opportunities now there, because there are growth, right. There are growth when you segment down and you look into specific areas, right. You still see good growth in -- generally speaking, in Health Care and consumer around the world, right. So those domestic markets are growing well, and we capitalize on that, right. You saw Health Care here is one of the highest growth rates for us going into next year, with the highest margin, I would say as well, right. So I think it's important that you make those calls and prioritize, and I'm very confident that the 3M team are doing it, because we have done it and for so many years that it's type of engrained in the DNA here and coming back to our cultural model of empowering people locally to go after the opportunities that they see there.\n\n---\n\nAnd I was wondering if you could elaborate just a little bit more on U.S. Industrial. You're certainly not alone highlighting weakness there in Q4. Would you say it's very, very broad-based? Or there're some pockets of strength, auto, for example? Or anything you could just kind of give us on maybe the key vertical exposures there would be helpful?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think it slowed and I would say I will more categorize it, maybe broad-based versus saying there was one specific area that slowed more than the other. So I think it was broad-based, generally speaking. And the industrial sector in United States have been going very well for quite some time, right. So I would say it's just slowing a little bit, so it's not the huge someone falling off the cliff, right. It's just that it's slowing down a little bit after done very well in one of the biggest sectors in the United States' economy. So I think it's broad-based. That's what we see at least, right. We cannot call out one division or business inside Industrial Business Group that is falling off more than the other. I think it's broad-based.\n\n---\n\nWe've covered a lot of ground, but I do want to just come back to the 4Q. It seems like when you gave the updates in October, it feels like you were trending in the low single digits. We've covered the consumer electronics, we covered U.S. industrial, weak. But to what extent are you seeing unusual behavior with your customers? And you mentioned you weren't seeing inventory adjustments back in October, but are you now starting to see that? And are you starting to be impacted by extended shutdowns over the holiday period?\n\n---\n\nYes, Nigel, we're -- a couple things just to put it in context. Fourth quarter last year, we were seeing quite a bit of activity in what we considered building inventory in the channel. We're clearly not seeing that occurring now. I'm not ready to declare that we're seeing necessarily channel inventory contracting more, but it's clearly not building. As far as quarterly trending of what we're seeing so far, Nigel, there's no particular trend we're seeing. It's -- what we've seen in October and November, and what we're estimating for December, it's all a very consistent movement of the low to negative growth that we're seeing in -- the negative growth we're seeing in industrial in the fourth quarter. As far as year-end behaviors of plant shutdowns, probably hearing just a little bit more of that than I did a year ago, but I can't say it's a substantial change in what I'm hearing.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's very helpful, Nick. One more thing. You mentioned the tax rate. So just thinking about your 2017 assumptions versus where we are in '16, one big variance is the tax rate's substantially higher, and I think you talked about the impact of FX on the tax rate. But I'm wondering, are you -- is also -- is there a greater proportion of overseas earnings been repatriated to help fund the capital allocation. Is that a factor in the higher tax rate?\n\n---\n\nNo, that's really not a factor in the tax rate. The main thing driving our tax rate is -- the factor driving our tax rate up is the strength of the U.S. dollar, which is, in essence, shifting more of our -- greater portion of our total earnings into the U.S, which is our highest tax jurisdiction. And that's offsetting much of the good progress we're making with our Centers of Excellence. In terms of a longer-term view, Nigel, in the past, I've talked about a 27% tax rate as a target by 2017. With the stronger U.S. dollar, we see that still occurring, but likely a couple of years later than what we had previously targeted.\n\n---\n\nNigel, it's Matt. One follow-up on that, Nigel. You'll see -- well, you did see and you will see that our international cash balances are lower than they have run. And it's not because we're choosing to repatriate and pay the tax cost. It's really because we've been able to deploy more of that cash toward acquisitions in a year where we've invested more in acquisitions.\n\n---\n\nSo just to make sure we know from a rounding perspective, what exactly do you think fourth quarter organic will be; something in the range of 2% to 3%, I think? And then also, just how do the monthlies play out here? Just curious as to the progression going forward -- going through the quarter.\n\n---\n\nSteve, we're -- just doing the math, it's approximately a 2% negative organic growth in the fourth quarter for us to land at the 1% organic growth for the total year. When we adjust for billing day anomalies between the months, that's a very consistent amongst all 3 months of the quarter.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, I'm just curious. As you say, you're kind of basing the -- you have your toughest comp in the first quarter. Should we just look at kind of how the comps progress, and then that's how the growth builds throughout the year? Or are you assuming second quarter is still relatively tough and kind of close to flat?\n\n---\n\nFor 2016, the biggest driver would -- in looking at how to quarterize this, is looking at the comps that we're going against in 2015; that would be the best guide. Otherwise, it will follow fairly normal trends.\n\n---\n\nThat makes a lot of sense. And then just one last question. Last year, I think productivity versus strategic investments was positive. This year, it's going to be negative. I know that there are some other things that go into that. You obviously have more restructuring to offset. Is that -- am I looking it at that the right way, that you look at these things in a holistic sense including all the variables? Or is there something now about kind of productivity offsetting strategic investments, whether it's just to get more growth, or it's a more competitive world? How should we kind of think about that trade off going forward?\n\n---\n\nSteve, I think the best way for you to think about it is I call that additional productivity. Clearly, the restructuring is a large driver of productivity that we're having to deliver in 2016 as we work through -- as we deliver this plan. But this was additional above and beyond, beyond what we had baked in through the restructuring. So if I were you, I'd be looking at those 2 in combination and trying to discern any kind of productivity trends over the years.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and then, sorry, one last quick one. You said 30 basis points of core price this year. So you're basically saying there's no impact from the foreign exchange on that, on the total price number?\n\n---\n\nYes, 30 is our core. If we have -- that excludes all of FX. FX total revenue impact were fairly muted in the expectation right now of a negative 1% to negative 3%. So there could be a little, but I think we're only talking 10 or 20 basis points on top of that if currencies stay where they are today.\n\n---\n\nOn the raw material side, how do we think about you're kind of planning for oil prices generally? And how you're thinking that's going to play out with the puts and takes in the portfolio for 2016?\n\n---\n\nOur $0.10 to $0.15 of raw material benefits that we're estimating is based on an assumption that oil prices will be in the $45 to $55 range on average through 2016. I'm clearly not going to try to predict what it's going to be, but that's what that assumption's based on. If it comes in lower than that, that can create a little bit more of a tailwind for us. If it's higher than that, it could start to put us to the lower end of that range. The other point I'd add out -- add to this is that $0.10 to $0.15, we clearly see the vast majority of that benefit coming in the first half of 2016, and very little of that coming in the second half of 2016.\n\n---\n\nGiven some of the currency moves you've seen worldwide and kind of your positioning in terms of your global production footprint, is there any areas of the world where you have to be particularly focused on share vigilance in terms of market share, in terms of pricing? I mean how do you think about that going into '16?\n\n---\n\nYes, I would call it unchanged. We've been diligent and vigilant on that throughout 2015 of how do these currency movements affect our competitiveness around the world. In particular, the movement in the euro against the U.S. dollar and what that does with European competition that's locally sourced in Europe. Part of our action to that is also adjusting our source of supply as needed as we move more of our source of supply into Europe, and we continue to expect more progress on that in 2016.\n\n---\n\nIf this is a worse downturn than perhaps you're modeling right now or thinking about right now, should we look at the antecedents of 2008 with the furloughs? Or what kind of actions is in the playbook to kind of think about how you'd kind of operate in a tougher cyclical rollover environment?\n\n---\n\nWell, if you live -- as you refer to the playbook, you can see there that you have operational excellence is the last strategy of the 6. And you have the people side, it is the fifth of the 6. And so if you think about that, business environment, as we know, things are changing. And you have just to make sure that you are ready to take action if you need to, right. So I would say that I've been in 3M for many years, as you know, and we have always a continuously plan ready to go if needed. I think that's one of the beauties that I've learned working in this company is to make sure that you always are ready to take action if you need to. So if you refer to the playbook, what's in the playbook, we are using the same playbook if -- as we did 2008 if we need to. I don't hope we need to, but we did the same at that point in time. One thing then that we did was to make sure that we didn't jeopardize investment for the future, meaning research and development and the people that stayed with us. Those are the 2 things when you think about a downturn that you should be very, very careful to touch: your investment for the future, specifically in research and development; and make sure that the individuals that are with you get all the development they need, because that will be the future when the economy is turning round again.\n\n---\n\nI think a lot of ground has been covered already. There was a couple of specific things I wanted to talk about. I mean you have, in your 2016 guide, $0.25 to $0.30 benefit from restructuring, and that assumes, I guess, that you're not going to be doing restructuring at a comparable rate to 2015. And I guess, piling on maybe Rob's question and even Jeff's before that, what type of a downside scenario do you need to see where you need to take another step of restructuring? And is it flat growth? Or is it something more like negative?\n\n---\n\nI think it would be more of a negative if you coming to that scenario, right. I think that our structure based on what we did in 2015 specifically, and what we have done over the last 4, 5 years, the structure is in a much better shape today versus when we went into a real downside in 2008, right. And I think the other thing you -- if you look upon that chart where we have gone from 6 sectors to 5 groups and we've gone from over 40 divisions or 40 divisions to 26, that's taking out structure and driving efficiency and productivity. So I would say that it'd need to be something negative in order for us to feel the need to take at a big, big swing as we go. But again, I -- we would take the action that is needed if it's coming, right.\n\n---\n\nYes, fair enough. Okay. And then just a little bit of a nit -- so I normally don't call out stuff like this, but on Slide 22, it says, \"Developing markets plus 2% to 6%.\" And then on Slide 23, you have the range of EM [ph] and it's more in the range of kind of 1% to 4%, and in EMEA, negative 1% to positive 2%. When you think -- and I see a range of plus 2% to plus 6%, it assumes, let's say, midpoint of plus 4%. It seems like a fairly aggressive forecast for EM [ph] just based on what we're seeing right now. Is there something -- within this forecast, first of all, kind of explain the differences between what's on Slide 22 and 23. But also, is there -- where has the underlying confidence, I guess, come from that EM [ph] isn't on that slippery slope to having another really tough year in front of us? I mean it's hard to imagine, short of mass amounts of stimulus in China, things get incrementally that much better, and Brazil seems to be falling off the face of the earth. What is the playbook, I guess, where things could get better fast enough for that 4% to become a reality, particularly based on what you probably show us in 4Q?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think first of all that you -- there's a couple of places where there eventually will be upside. And I think China could be, for sure, and China must be, in order for you to get growth and if you have decided to be a lowball growth company, you must grow in China. So you have China part of it. You have also India, part of it. India is a portion where I believe that we can see a positive uptick 2016, to be honest. You can also see in some of the countries in Central/East Europe that will eventually do better. And the 3 bigs there is, of course, Russia, Poland and Turkey. And I think based on their performance, maybe the last 24 months, I think we are closer to see a positive growth curve eventually coming there. So I will say that -- and then you have Southeast Asia. We should not underestimate Southeast Asia. That is, in our plan, an important growth driver for us. And as you know, Southeast Asia, you can look upon as both you have the domestic market there, but you have also -- you should also view them as almost a supplier both to Japan and to China. So I will say that if you take the bigger pockets of real growth that eventually will capitalize and materialize, you need China, you need Southeast Asia and India is also a positive -- have a more positive outlook, than I think we appreciate at this point in time. I totally agree with you on Brazil, totally agree with you on Brazil; that will take us another 2 years. So Brazil will not help from that perspective. I think about the deal [ph], is that making sense for you?\n\n---\n\nYes. No, it totally does. I guess I'm thinking about in terms of context of you've probably been working on this outlook for the last couple of months and just the rate of change in the last week, just look at commodity prices overall and then the data we're getting even out of India is just -- is weakening by the day also. So I'm just trying to figure out if this is an aspirational guide as far as emerging markets. Or if you actually really do see something on the ground that maybe we don't see in the government data that would lead you to believe that we would not be -- I mean, for example, if you're going to do 4% in emerging markets next year, you would have -- it would be tough to have the first half of the year be negative, right? It would be -- make -- regardless of comps, it would make it pretty tough. So I guess I'm trying to delineate between the 2 of what we see or in data, which I'm sure you see as well versus what your local salespeople and local guys are saying. And of course, you have some businesses like Health Care that could be growing no matter what.\n\n---\n\nSure, yes. No, no, it's -- I will say that I keep it to what I said relative to geographical growth drivers. H.C. Shin that is leading our International business, give us very good confidence relative to what is there and bubbling up, right. And he just came back from -- he came back Thursday I think from being a trip down to Middle East, right, including Saudi Arabia. And there is pockets of growth there that is very impressive to be honest, right. And in Middle East, right, in Middle East. You have to take all those pieces together and reality will be that it will -- the turn need to come in the big places, right. Need to come in China, need to come in India, need to come in Southeast Asia. And that's what I'm saying. Don't underestimate Southeast Asia.\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you. To wrap up, 3M is positioned for a successful 2016. As you have heard, we expect to deliver strong earnings growth while continuing to invest in the business. This includes investments in organic growth and productivity, which will enable us to generate efficient growth next year and for years to come. \r\nWe look forward to seeing you in March, and when we will show you our new research laboratory and share more details about our long-term plans. Thank you for joining us, and have a great day.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Andrew Obin (Analysts)】\nYes, a 2-part question. So the first question, just lowering guidance. We still haven't finished Q4. Can you just be more specific as to where are you seeing headwinds, specifically by geographies or markets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nYes, Andrew. As I said earlier, it does reflect the reality globally of what we're seeing. We're seeing particular weakness in industrial-related businesses in the United States, and we're also seeing weaker-than-expected demand in consumer electronics. For the quarter, we're estimating organic growth in Electronics and Energy to be down high single digits, and we're estimating Industrial and Safety and Graphics to be down low single digits. Our Health Care and Consumer businesses are continuing -- we're continuing to see good performance, Andrew.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Obin (Analysts)】\nAnd just another question if I understood correctly. So you had your '13 to '17 5-year plan, and you're talking about rolling out new plan in 2016. So does that mean we're sort of scrapping -- going to scrap the old 5-year plan and just going to roll out new targets if -- am I understanding this correctly, sorry?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nWell, we were talking about the new 5-year plan, right. And as you recall, the way we lay out the plan in 2012 with the targets around free cash flow conversion, return on invested capital, EPS growth and organic growth, I think we are on track relative to that plan, generally speaking, with a couple of metrics actually ahead. Free cash flow conversion and return on invested capital, we are ahead on that. And then I would say we go -- maybe we'll be, as you look forward now, as to what have changed a little bit, have been more of a challenge for most people around growth as you know, right. So I think it's time for us to look upon the target as we move ahead, and I think March is a good time for us to do that. With that said, I'm personally very pleased with how we're operating and the way the playbook is working and so forth. So it's -- but I think specifically, around the growth portion, right, if you -- the expectation in 2012, way back then, was slightly different than it is today, right. And we can even see some changes around the world just the last year or maybe the last 6 months. As you know, if you look upon what was expected then from developing world versus what we see and developed world versus what we see, right. So we have all been around long enough to see there've been a shift in the last 3 years. And I think we just would like to make sure we all understand it and that we put the resources in the right place and you guys also know what to expect from us as we move forward. I am very encouraged about the plan that is in place and executed. But we have made some shifts, positive shifts, I would say in our portfolio as well, right. So we have done all this work that we have done the last 3 years. I think to take a new look at the plan and talk to you guys about it, I think is appropriate to do.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Julian Mitchell (Analysts)】\nJust wanted to start off with a question on the geographic outlook. So maybe, Nick, you've a bit more color on Q4 if the U.S. is the only region that's down in sales year-on-year or were there other regions as well? And then on the 2016 geographic outlook, I was intrigued you talked about China growing. So is that just on the assumption that there's a sharp sort of step change sometime early next year? And also in EMEA, you had a down number there at the bottom end of the range, even though EMEA seems to have been a fairly steady performance recently. So any color on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nWell, this is Inge. I think, first of all to -- if you look upon 2016 and the outlook, you know this -- it's -- you talked about China, yes, we have China and Japan actually low to mid-single-digit growth. And I was recently in China and I would say there is, of course, growth, right. You have just to prioritize right and execute the plan, and I don't think, generally speaking, that -- you talked about the step change, I don't know if there's step change. This is the second biggest economy in the world. There is growth, generally speaking, specifically, it's what I would call, domestic businesses. And by definition, our penetration is low. So we should grow there. No doubt about it and our plan is good, right. Our plan is good, and we are prioritized right there. I think if you just talk about next year, I think that Latin America and Canada, we talked about 1% to 4%, I think in that part of the world, in Latin America specifically, they will do okay, driven by Mexico. I think Brazil still will be a challenge, and I think we have to think about that for may be 1 -- eventually 2 more years before Brazil will come back to how we remember Brazil in the past. And then we have to see what is happening in West Europe. And I will say that you heard here that we talk about it type of on the low end, of course. And there is a lot of political things that are going on that is -- may putting some, I would say, uncertainty in a way. Now, again, my view is West Europe is a very sophisticated market. They are driving a lot of technology advancements there, which is good for 3M. So there will not be a stellar growth, but we are there and we will capitalize on what we can do. Just to your first point relative to the last quarter here, I think as Nick said, we see a slowdown, what I think is more the global sentiment in consumer electronics. And I think we all have seen some reports coming out lately that if you go the whole way from smartphones to tablets and TVs, there is a small downturn in that. And my view, temporarily, because we know that's a cyclical business and it will come back again. And for me personally, I'm very pleased with the work that we have done in Electronics and Energy business group in order to optimize our portfolio and are able to deliver very robust and good margin, despite that we will see a downturn in volume for 1 or 2 quarters, right. So I don't know if you recall that we were running that business at 15.7% at the time. And I think this year, you will be very pleased when you see the end result relative to margins. So I'm very pleased with that business in the way we operate. Now, we would like to see more growth all the time, but that's type of the nature of that business. So I hope that helps.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Julian Mitchell (Analysts)】\nYes, that does. And then just my second question would be on pricing. If you exclude the sort of the FX adjustment impact, how you feel about pricing entering 2016 versus how you felt about pricing power, say, 6 or 12 months ago?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nJulian, the -- when we strip out FX, our core pricing, excluding pricing actions we take in reaction to FX movements, that core has been, over a period of years, in the 30 to 50 basis point range. It's probably been in -- about at a 30 basis point range for 2015, and we think that range is about right for us going forward into 2016. We're not seeing a change on that front, Julian.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Zhao (Analysts)】\nThis is George Zhao on for Steve. As you put together your 2016 organic growth forecast, how much of the business would you say you have a decent visibility into, distribution or direct sales, rather than looking at IPI or other macro forecasts?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nWell, I think it all depends on the different business groups. As you know, some -- if you think about 3M, we have a lot of business that are spec-ed and design-in, and then you have type of the, I would say, consumables, right. So I think on the spec and design-in, we have a very good view on it. And on consumables, maybe some time, we are 1 or 2 layers back. But I would say that we have pretty good -- pretty good visibility in the different businesses relative to inventory situations. And as a combination, as you know, of facts and some are, right, relative to the connection into the different business groups. So you take that, and you -- I don't think anyone, to be honest, will have a total picture of it, at any company. I've never met anyone that can tell me in total how it look like. And so I think it's a combination of you feel the fabric of the business, and then, you, of course, look upon the growth rate that is estimated in the marketplace, which is a strong indicator, if you like, relative to how we should plan moving forward. So I think it's a combination of science and art, to be honest.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Zhao (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, Nick, I'm trying to piece together your OEM margin assumptions for next year, given the EPS walk and getting close to 60 basis points. Am I in the right ballpark there? And could you provide some more color on that margin assumption?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nYes, George, I'll go through that in a little more detail from a margin perspective. 2016 will be another year where we're expecting margin enhancement. At the midpoint of our guidance, that would assume that we're at approximately 150 basis points of margin expansion for 2016. So -- and the drivers of that margin expansion year-on-year is our restructuring that we've covered, both the impact to 2015 and to 2016; pension; the additional productivity; price raw material benefit; and to some extent, volume, depending on where we are in that 1% to 3% range for organic growth. And that will be partially offset. Our margin headwinds next year will be -- are the strategic investments I talked about, as well as FX; that we see FX becoming -- reducing our margin in 2016.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Ritchie (Analysts)】\nSo I guess my first question is really maybe talking a little bit about the organic growth cadence in next year first half versus second half, given that we're going to be exiting 4Q with negative organic growth. Just curious how you see organic growth stepping up or down next year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nYes. Joe, first of all, I did say earlier, we expect the first half to be more challenging for growth than the second half, or that we expect higher organic growth in the second half. If I get even more specific, the first quarter of 2016 will be having our most challenging comp. Organic growth in the first quarter of 2015 was 3.3%. And within that, we had our Electronics and Energy with high growth. The Electronics business in the first quarter was up 10%. So that's creating a challenging comp for us in the first quarter. We're anticipating that total company organic growth could be slightly negative in the first quarter, with increasing growth as we progress through the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Ritchie (Analysts)】\nGreat. That's helpful color, Nick. Maybe kind of switching gears a little bit to the balance sheet. The $2 billion to $4 billion in incremental debt in 2016, I think puts your gross leverage closer to 2x. And so, I guess, I'm just wondering with the capital allocation plans that you have moving forward, how much more capacity do you have to maintain your credit rating today?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nJoe, this has been part of a journey that we announced a couple of years ago about better optimizing our capital structure. We've been making progress on that as we've added leverage in the last couple of -- the last few years to our balance sheet. And just to put your question in context, as we think about that, it's not so much managing to a particular debt rating, but if your question is if we add significant leverage from this point forward and whether we have the capacity or appetite to do that, we would consider that for the right strategic opportunity. And by right strategic opportunity, it'd be a large strategic value-enhancing acquisition that would be the most likely. Nothing like that contemplated now. But we have added leverage. We're clearly adding leverage in 2016. Beyond that, we'll talk in a little more depth on that in our 2020 plan outlook that we share late in March, Joe.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Shannon O'Callaghan (Analysts)】\nCan I have follow-up on the West Europe guidance? It seems like sort of through the year here, you guys were hoping to and maybe encouraged by some of the things you were seeing in West Europe, and now we're sort of guiding a minus 1%, plus 1%. Have you seen things take a step back there? Or maybe, Inge, talk about some of those points of caution that you're referencing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nYes, if we go back to the beginning of the year and you think about the currency effects, et cetera, I think that all of us at that point in time had a view that, specifically, export will accelerate out from West Europe. If you recall that type of thesis, that was an external view. It did not really happen, right. And I think it was a combination of maybe not the best execution of the European businesses. I'm not talking 3M; I'm talking about the business environment over there and some other challenges that happened specifically in Germany, I think, right, which is more a bigger issue both politically and around some of the companies there that went into some challenging situations. So -- and I would say that the latest things that happened here on November 13 in Paris is, of course, for all of us, may be tempering down of how will it look like for 2016. So for us, again, is to say that we are looking for margin expansion. We are planning for a situation where it will be slow growth, right. And I think the best thing to do when you plan is to make sure that you are more conservative in an environment like that than type of living on hope. I mean, hope is not a strategy, right. And so, I think you have to be cautious relative to how 2016 will be. And then, hopefully, it will be better. But I think it's important for us as we are driving for efficient growth, is to make sure that if your plan is that you now make sure that your structure is as lean as possible, that you take out as much layer in management as you can and focus in on execution in the front-end in terms of sales and marketing a commercial decision. Because, as you know, it's different languages over there, there are some cases that are even different currencies, so you need to be strong in the front. And then, be very aggressive relative to your corporate structure, which we are and been for quite some time. And so I will say for me, around West Europe, the outlook on growth is what it is. We need to do better whatever the growth rate is coming out of the countries. And then, it will be all about margin expansion. And we have the lowest margin in West Europe of any entity in 3M. And that's also why we do a lot over there relative to our supply chain optimization and our service center that we opened up in Poland, et cetera. So big focus in West Europe on efficiency and whatever growth will come, we will take it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Shannon O'Callaghan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then on the higher R&D and some of these other strategic investments you're making, where are we now in terms of the payoff from those things? What are you seeing? I mean when you first started to take that R&D up, the idea was to increase more in basic research with the idea of trying to get some more breakthrough-type product, which obviously would take a little longer. Where are we on that now? What are you seeing kind of come through the system?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nYes, so first of all, you see that we are coming 5.8% in R&D investment as we speak. If you take that whole initiative, if you just make a summary for you where we started, we have had 30 programs started; we have 19 that we started out in '13; we have 7 in '14; and we have 4 in '15. And I would say that of all those, 7 have been discontinued, right. Seven of them said, \"Hey, this will not work.\" So I feel good about 13, 7 out in the process, which is, for me, an indication of productivity is coming big time to research and development as well. We invested $40 million in '13. We have total up to 2014, we have had $100 million invested and we had 7 programs now that have been in early stages of execution. So I will say that I am pleased with that initiative, and as you know, it's about disruptive technologies. So we take longer time. But I'm pleased what I'm seeing and strange as it is sometimes, you're also pleased to see that we, in fact, stop something early, which I said we have stopped or discontinued 7 of the programs. So I think that you should think about it that we had sales in this year around -- from those programs around $200 million. And I think it will be double that by '16, like $400 million. So you have a $400 million sales by '16 on that initiative, which is a long-term initiative, right. So for me to get $400 million by '16 is okay. It's okay. I'm never happy, as you know. So I would say it's okay, but I'm pleased with the evolution of that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Deane Dray (Analysts)】\nOn the 2016 EPS walk. I was hoping to get some additional color on some of the assumptions that went into 2 of the buckets. The additional productivity, so what kinds of investments are being made there and some specifics? And then also, under the strategic investments, what are -- is the ERP system in there? What are -- is there anything that's discretionary that you might be able to roll back later in the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nDeane, I'll cover the additional productivity piece. And for that, I put a range of $0.00 to $0.10 and those are on top of everything that we're getting for productivity in 2016 from the restructuring that we're doing in 2015. About half of that is coming from our business transformation. And by business transformation, the efforts we're doing there, where we're working on our changing and standardizing our global business process implementing ERP to improve our customer service and responsiveness. We're also establishing global service centers, Inge talked about one of those being deployed. That's a big part of that productivity. Some of the CapEx that I talked about in the past where we're investing in automation, that's also part of the productivity, the additional productivity. The Lean Six Sigma efforts that we have been putting in and continue to increase our efforts on. And all of that additional productivity, Deane, is net of any kind of inflation we see on wages. So this is productivity that more than offsets wage inflation.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nAnd to the other piece there, you have to look upon that, that they are investments that will support our ongoing portfolio efforts. And I would say to enhance the ability to serve our markets better. So we put that aside in order to make sure as we go that we can take action in order to improve productivity and we speak and could be a smaller factory somewhere that we will consolidate in one way or the other, or just to have the flexibility to make those investments as we move ahead, as we strengthen the portfolio I would say. And then we have done, as you know, for the last couple of years, we have taken pieces of it here and there, including business transformation as you talked about. But we're coming to a different point now on business transformation. So we say it will now go more to strengthen the portfolio as we move ahead.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Deane Dray (Analysts)】\nAnd just 1 follow-up: Are you contemplating additional potential divestitures from the portfolio similar to what's being looked at on health information systems?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nWell, portfolio management is an ongoing process, as you know. So I would say that we are constantly evaluating our self pieces of the portfolio if it will create more value inside or outside of 3M. But you also know that we are very dependent on our technologies in order to drive certain businesses. So I think that's an important element to think about. So I will say that what we had at that -- I think the interesting thing here, Deane, is to say that when we worked on that category under Strategic Review that started $2.5 billion, they were businesses that were underperforming versus the average of 3M, 1 very good business is that one I addressed. Health information system is different, right. So that's more a question of can we, in our business model, create additional value for you and for us versus doing it in a different way. But I don't think there is anything else in front of me at this point in time for consideration. I've not seen it, so it's not that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Sprague (Analysts)】\nInge, can you just maybe step back a little bit? Obviously, we're in a very unusual economic environment here. I just wonder what gives you confidence that we're not in the early innings of something more negative than you've put forth for 2016. And kind of what are you looking at to kind of recalibrate that forecast as things kind of play out here the next several months? Are there a couple of indicators -- external indicators or dynamics in your business that you're really looking to for kind of a clue on where this global economy is actually headed?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nWell, first of all, we base a lot of our assumptions, of course, on external facts and data that is coming towards us. And then we often temper that down because we know often we're coming out that is slightly optimistic in the beginning. And I think we have facts on that as well, that as the quarters and years are going, it's all tempering down if it's IPI, Industrial Production Index or GDP. But then, in addition to that, there is an important element is to, in the monthly and quarterly meetings that we have with the division, get the feeling of what is going on in their specific markets. And then, all the trips that I do personally in order to travel around to different parts of the world in order to get the feeling for it, I will say that I don't, at this point in time, see anything that is indicating for me that it will be much, much slower as we move into '16. So I think what you see here is realistic based on the information that I have at hand at this point in time. I think that the change may be, as we indicated here, is maybe on the consumer electronic part where you saw other indication coming out earlier this week or end of last week, where it looked like smartphones, tablets and even TVs in that space, and I think also into semiconductor, had slowed a little bit. But reality is that those businesses go in a cycle, and they will turn around again. And as I said earlier on another question, me, myself, I'm very pleased with the work we have done in that business now to have a structure in place where we can produce and deliver very good margins even in a downturn. But I would say I've been around here the last quarter to most parts around the world and, generally speaking, you would say that there is -- there will be positive growth and there is growth opportunities. I think it's up to us with the portfolio work we have done, and I'm talking now portfolio work on a local level in each country, to go after those opportunities now there, because there are growth, right. There are growth when you segment down and you look into specific areas, right. You still see good growth in -- generally speaking, in Health Care and consumer around the world, right. So those domestic markets are growing well, and we capitalize on that, right. You saw Health Care here is one of the highest growth rates for us going into next year, with the highest margin, I would say as well, right. So I think it's important that you make those calls and prioritize, and I'm very confident that the 3M team are doing it, because we have done it and for so many years that it's type of engrained in the DNA here and coming back to our cultural model of empowering people locally to go after the opportunities that they see there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Sprague (Analysts)】\nAnd I was wondering if you could elaborate just a little bit more on U.S. Industrial. You're certainly not alone highlighting weakness there in Q4. Would you say it's very, very broad-based? Or there're some pockets of strength, auto, for example? Or anything you could just kind of give us on maybe the key vertical exposures there would be helpful?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nYes. I think it slowed and I would say I will more categorize it, maybe broad-based versus saying there was one specific area that slowed more than the other. So I think it was broad-based, generally speaking. And the industrial sector in United States have been going very well for quite some time, right. So I would say it's just slowing a little bit, so it's not the huge someone falling off the cliff, right. It's just that it's slowing down a little bit after done very well in one of the biggest sectors in the United States' economy. So I think it's broad-based. That's what we see at least, right. We cannot call out one division or business inside Industrial Business Group that is falling off more than the other. I think it's broad-based.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nigel Coe (Analysts)】\nWe've covered a lot of ground, but I do want to just come back to the 4Q. It seems like when you gave the updates in October, it feels like you were trending in the low single digits. We've covered the consumer electronics, we covered U.S. industrial, weak. But to what extent are you seeing unusual behavior with your customers? And you mentioned you weren't seeing inventory adjustments back in October, but are you now starting to see that? And are you starting to be impacted by extended shutdowns over the holiday period?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nYes, Nigel, we're -- a couple things just to put it in context. Fourth quarter last year, we were seeing quite a bit of activity in what we considered building inventory in the channel. We're clearly not seeing that occurring now. I'm not ready to declare that we're seeing necessarily channel inventory contracting more, but it's clearly not building. As far as quarterly trending of what we're seeing so far, Nigel, there's no particular trend we're seeing. It's -- what we've seen in October and November, and what we're estimating for December, it's all a very consistent movement of the low to negative growth that we're seeing in -- the negative growth we're seeing in industrial in the fourth quarter. As far as year-end behaviors of plant shutdowns, probably hearing just a little bit more of that than I did a year ago, but I can't say it's a substantial change in what I'm hearing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nigel Coe (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's very helpful, Nick. One more thing. You mentioned the tax rate. So just thinking about your 2017 assumptions versus where we are in '16, one big variance is the tax rate's substantially higher, and I think you talked about the impact of FX on the tax rate. But I'm wondering, are you -- is also -- is there a greater proportion of overseas earnings been repatriated to help fund the capital allocation. Is that a factor in the higher tax rate?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nNo, that's really not a factor in the tax rate. The main thing driving our tax rate is -- the factor driving our tax rate up is the strength of the U.S. dollar, which is, in essence, shifting more of our -- greater portion of our total earnings into the U.S, which is our highest tax jurisdiction. And that's offsetting much of the good progress we're making with our Centers of Excellence. In terms of a longer-term view, Nigel, in the past, I've talked about a 27% tax rate as a target by 2017. With the stronger U.S. dollar, we see that still occurring, but likely a couple of years later than what we had previously targeted.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matthew Ginter (Executives)】\nNigel, it's Matt. One follow-up on that, Nigel. You'll see -- well, you did see and you will see that our international cash balances are lower than they have run. And it's not because we're choosing to repatriate and pay the tax cost. It's really because we've been able to deploy more of that cash toward acquisitions in a year where we've invested more in acquisitions.\n\n---\n\n【質問: C. Stephen Tusa (Analysts)】\nSo just to make sure we know from a rounding perspective, what exactly do you think fourth quarter organic will be; something in the range of 2% to 3%, I think? And then also, just how do the monthlies play out here? Just curious as to the progression going forward -- going through the quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nSteve, we're -- just doing the math, it's approximately a 2% negative organic growth in the fourth quarter for us to land at the 1% organic growth for the total year. When we adjust for billing day anomalies between the months, that's a very consistent amongst all 3 months of the quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: C. Stephen Tusa (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, I'm just curious. As you say, you're kind of basing the -- you have your toughest comp in the first quarter. Should we just look at kind of how the comps progress, and then that's how the growth builds throughout the year? Or are you assuming second quarter is still relatively tough and kind of close to flat?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nFor 2016, the biggest driver would -- in looking at how to quarterize this, is looking at the comps that we're going against in 2015; that would be the best guide. Otherwise, it will follow fairly normal trends.\n\n---\n\n【質問: C. Stephen Tusa (Analysts)】\nThat makes a lot of sense. And then just one last question. Last year, I think productivity versus strategic investments was positive. This year, it's going to be negative. I know that there are some other things that go into that. You obviously have more restructuring to offset. Is that -- am I looking it at that the right way, that you look at these things in a holistic sense including all the variables? Or is there something now about kind of productivity offsetting strategic investments, whether it's just to get more growth, or it's a more competitive world? How should we kind of think about that trade off going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nSteve, I think the best way for you to think about it is I call that additional productivity. Clearly, the restructuring is a large driver of productivity that we're having to deliver in 2016 as we work through -- as we deliver this plan. But this was additional above and beyond, beyond what we had baked in through the restructuring. So if I were you, I'd be looking at those 2 in combination and trying to discern any kind of productivity trends over the years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: C. Stephen Tusa (Analysts)】\nOkay, and then, sorry, one last quick one. You said 30 basis points of core price this year. So you're basically saying there's no impact from the foreign exchange on that, on the total price number?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nYes, 30 is our core. If we have -- that excludes all of FX. FX total revenue impact were fairly muted in the expectation right now of a negative 1% to negative 3%. So there could be a little, but I think we're only talking 10 or 20 basis points on top of that if currencies stay where they are today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert McCarthy (Analysts)】\nOn the raw material side, how do we think about you're kind of planning for oil prices generally? And how you're thinking that's going to play out with the puts and takes in the portfolio for 2016?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nOur $0.10 to $0.15 of raw material benefits that we're estimating is based on an assumption that oil prices will be in the $45 to $55 range on average through 2016. I'm clearly not going to try to predict what it's going to be, but that's what that assumption's based on. If it comes in lower than that, that can create a little bit more of a tailwind for us. If it's higher than that, it could start to put us to the lower end of that range. The other point I'd add out -- add to this is that $0.10 to $0.15, we clearly see the vast majority of that benefit coming in the first half of 2016, and very little of that coming in the second half of 2016.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert McCarthy (Analysts)】\nGiven some of the currency moves you've seen worldwide and kind of your positioning in terms of your global production footprint, is there any areas of the world where you have to be particularly focused on share vigilance in terms of market share, in terms of pricing? I mean how do you think about that going into '16?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicholas Gangestad (Executives)】\nYes, I would call it unchanged. We've been diligent and vigilant on that throughout 2015 of how do these currency movements affect our competitiveness around the world. In particular, the movement in the euro against the U.S. dollar and what that does with European competition that's locally sourced in Europe. Part of our action to that is also adjusting our source of supply as needed as we move more of our source of supply into Europe, and we continue to expect more progress on that in 2016.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert McCarthy (Analysts)】\nIf this is a worse downturn than perhaps you're modeling right now or thinking about right now, should we look at the antecedents of 2008 with the furloughs? Or what kind of actions is in the playbook to kind of think about how you'd kind of operate in a tougher cyclical rollover environment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nWell, if you live -- as you refer to the playbook, you can see there that you have operational excellence is the last strategy of the 6. And you have the people side, it is the fifth of the 6. And so if you think about that, business environment, as we know, things are changing. And you have just to make sure that you are ready to take action if you need to, right. So I would say that I've been in 3M for many years, as you know, and we have always a continuously plan ready to go if needed. I think that's one of the beauties that I've learned working in this company is to make sure that you always are ready to take action if you need to. So if you refer to the playbook, what's in the playbook, we are using the same playbook if -- as we did 2008 if we need to. I don't hope we need to, but we did the same at that point in time. One thing then that we did was to make sure that we didn't jeopardize investment for the future, meaning research and development and the people that stayed with us. Those are the 2 things when you think about a downturn that you should be very, very careful to touch: your investment for the future, specifically in research and development; and make sure that the individuals that are with you get all the development they need, because that will be the future when the economy is turning round again.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Davis (Analysts)】\nI think a lot of ground has been covered already. There was a couple of specific things I wanted to talk about. I mean you have, in your 2016 guide, $0.25 to $0.30 benefit from restructuring, and that assumes, I guess, that you're not going to be doing restructuring at a comparable rate to 2015. And I guess, piling on maybe Rob's question and even Jeff's before that, what type of a downside scenario do you need to see where you need to take another step of restructuring? And is it flat growth? Or is it something more like negative?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nI think it would be more of a negative if you coming to that scenario, right. I think that our structure based on what we did in 2015 specifically, and what we have done over the last 4, 5 years, the structure is in a much better shape today versus when we went into a real downside in 2008, right. And I think the other thing you -- if you look upon that chart where we have gone from 6 sectors to 5 groups and we've gone from over 40 divisions or 40 divisions to 26, that's taking out structure and driving efficiency and productivity. So I would say that it'd need to be something negative in order for us to feel the need to take at a big, big swing as we go. But again, I -- we would take the action that is needed if it's coming, right.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Davis (Analysts)】\nYes, fair enough. Okay. And then just a little bit of a nit -- so I normally don't call out stuff like this, but on Slide 22, it says, \"Developing markets plus 2% to 6%.\" And then on Slide 23, you have the range of EM [ph] and it's more in the range of kind of 1% to 4%, and in EMEA, negative 1% to positive 2%. When you think -- and I see a range of plus 2% to plus 6%, it assumes, let's say, midpoint of plus 4%. It seems like a fairly aggressive forecast for EM [ph] just based on what we're seeing right now. Is there something -- within this forecast, first of all, kind of explain the differences between what's on Slide 22 and 23. But also, is there -- where has the underlying confidence, I guess, come from that EM [ph] isn't on that slippery slope to having another really tough year in front of us? I mean it's hard to imagine, short of mass amounts of stimulus in China, things get incrementally that much better, and Brazil seems to be falling off the face of the earth. What is the playbook, I guess, where things could get better fast enough for that 4% to become a reality, particularly based on what you probably show us in 4Q?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nWell, I think first of all that you -- there's a couple of places where there eventually will be upside. And I think China could be, for sure, and China must be, in order for you to get growth and if you have decided to be a lowball growth company, you must grow in China. So you have China part of it. You have also India, part of it. India is a portion where I believe that we can see a positive uptick 2016, to be honest. You can also see in some of the countries in Central/East Europe that will eventually do better. And the 3 bigs there is, of course, Russia, Poland and Turkey. And I think based on their performance, maybe the last 24 months, I think we are closer to see a positive growth curve eventually coming there. So I will say that -- and then you have Southeast Asia. We should not underestimate Southeast Asia. That is, in our plan, an important growth driver for us. And as you know, Southeast Asia, you can look upon as both you have the domestic market there, but you have also -- you should also view them as almost a supplier both to Japan and to China. So I will say that if you take the bigger pockets of real growth that eventually will capitalize and materialize, you need China, you need Southeast Asia and India is also a positive -- have a more positive outlook, than I think we appreciate at this point in time. I totally agree with you on Brazil, totally agree with you on Brazil; that will take us another 2 years. So Brazil will not help from that perspective. I think about the deal [ph], is that making sense for you?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Davis (Analysts)】\nYes. No, it totally does. I guess I'm thinking about in terms of context of you've probably been working on this outlook for the last couple of months and just the rate of change in the last week, just look at commodity prices overall and then the data we're getting even out of India is just -- is weakening by the day also. So I'm just trying to figure out if this is an aspirational guide as far as emerging markets. Or if you actually really do see something on the ground that maybe we don't see in the government data that would lead you to believe that we would not be -- I mean, for example, if you're going to do 4% in emerging markets next year, you would have -- it would be tough to have the first half of the year be negative, right? It would be -- make -- regardless of comps, it would make it pretty tough. So I guess I'm trying to delineate between the 2 of what we see or in data, which I'm sure you see as well versus what your local salespeople and local guys are saying. And of course, you have some businesses like Health Care that could be growing no matter what.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nSure, yes. No, no, it's -- I will say that I keep it to what I said relative to geographical growth drivers. H.C. Shin that is leading our International business, give us very good confidence relative to what is there and bubbling up, right. And he just came back from -- he came back Thursday I think from being a trip down to Middle East, right, including Saudi Arabia. And there is pockets of growth there that is very impressive to be honest, right. And in Middle East, right, in Middle East. You have to take all those pieces together and reality will be that it will -- the turn need to come in the big places, right. Need to come in China, need to come in India, need to come in Southeast Asia. And that's what I'm saying. Don't underestimate Southeast Asia.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Inge Thulin (Executives)】\nWell, thank you. To wrap up, 3M is positioned for a successful 2016. As you have heard, we expect to deliver strong earnings growth while continuing to invest in the business. This includes investments in organic growth and productivity, which will enable us to generate efficient growth next year and for years to come. \r\nWe look forward to seeing you in March, and when we will show you our new research laboratory and share more details about our long-term plans. Thank you for joining us, and have a great day.",

As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, investors.nike.com. \r\nJoining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand; and finally, we'll hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Andy Campion, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] \r\nI'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone, and happy holidays. Q2 was another strong quarter for NIKE. We continued to show that we have the ability to drive both profitable growth and significant shareholder value over the long term. \r\nLet's take a look at the highlights from the second quarter. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 4% to $7.7 billion despite continued FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 12%. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points and earnings per share increased 22% to $0.90.\r\nThe success you see today and the opportunities ahead are driven by the strength of our portfolio. NIKE has many dimensions to our business, and together, they're operating powerfully and efficiently. We're connecting deeply with consumers through products and experiences and capturing value through our strategic -- through our strategies and investments. Our complete offense, which includes our brands, geographies and categories, makes us flexible and keeps us close to the consumer so we can see and act on new opportunities in real time. We see it in the markets we transform like China and Western Europe and in the businesses we accelerate like Women's and the Jordan Brand. Our operational scale is second to none. We have the power to grow the entire marketplace and innovate through our global supply chain that shipped roughly 1.1 billion units this last year. And as we've shown consistently, everything we do is executed with a sharp focus and a financial discipline. We have a proven track record of delivering top line growth, expanding profitability and maintaining a high return on invested capital. And because we drive consistent profitable growth, we're able to deliver strong returns to our shareholders. For example, we recently announced a 4-year $12 billion share repurchase program. We increased our annual cash dividend for the 14th year in a row, and we announced a 2-for-1 stock split. It's clear we have the right plan in place against the backdrop of a global movement of fitness and sports. It's all adding up to incredible momentum for our business, but we're never fully satisfied. More than ever, we're focused on the areas where we can continue to get better and making the necessary changes to ensure we continue to drive strong profitable growth for the long term.\r\nThe force behind today's results and our future potential is, of course, innovation. Our obsession and relentless drive to be better is at the core of our culture and our strategy. And as you know, it starts with product. We invent breakthroughs then build a thriving business around them. We told you during our Investor Day how we've built Flyknit from a concept to a billion-dollar platform in just 4 years. This is the kind of search for scalable innovation that's going on every day at NIKE, and just as important is our focus on bringing innovations to market in a directed and productive way through merchandising and marketplace management across all channels and multiple price points.\r\nInnovation is also fueled by partnerships. When we partner, it can be like setting off a chain reaction, leading us to new and better ideas more quickly. It's why we value our relationships with athletes, NIKE's original and most important collaborators. Our relationships with thousands of athletes, teams and federations do more than build our brand. They give us personal access to their insights and the science behind the problems they need to solve. That's why we work with the best athletes like Lebron and Serena, Cristiano, along with everyday athletes, frankly like the rest of us. Partnerships also play a critical role in creating and expanding the marketplace. With our long-standing wholesale partners, we give consumers broad access to NIKE, and together, we segment and differentiate our assortments to drive mutually profitable retail.\r\nAt NIKE, collaboration is also a powerful strategy for activating new ways to work. As the clear leader in our industry, we align ourselves with leaders in other industries. To that end, we announced 2 new partnerships in October. The first is DreamWorks and their technology company called NOVA. With this partnership, we've combined the expertise of 2 design leaders: NIKE with the human body in motion and DreamWorks with the animated body in motion. I've been talking with our design teams and they see great potential in NOVA's platforms to advance our creation process in capability, precision and speed.\r\nThe second is Flex. Many of you know about the impressive work that Flex does, who are already accelerating our manufacturing revolution efforts. It's in the early stages yet, but in one specific process, they've combined automated material management with automated laser cutting, which can reduce waste by up to 50%. This is just one example of many that are in development, and what we learned from Flex, we expect to scale across our broad global source base. \r\nFor the consumer, our partnership has the potential to expand their list of choices and accelerate delivery times from weeks to months -- or I'm sorry, from weeks to days. Strike that. Both partnerships are at an intersection of another vital innovation driver and that's digital. At NIKE, digital does more than just add capabilities for today. It defines how consumers will experience the NIKE Brand moving forward. It's an accelerator across our business, in product through the supply chain, in analytics and all the way to retail. A few weeks ago, we shared our long-term vision for e-commerce growth, $7 billion in revenue by the end of fiscal year '20. In Q2, we continued our accelerated pace, growing the NIKE.com business nearly 50% on a constant-currency basis. We added Canada, Switzerland and Norway to our expanding list of e-commerce markets, and next quarter, we're planning to do the same for the sport-obsessed cultures of Mexico, Turkey and Chile. When we expand our NIKE.com footprint, it gives new consumers access to the best of NIKE and it drives great energy for our business.\r\nWe have focused our investments in digital and mobile over the last several years, and they're paying off. Driving the connection of NIKE.com to our broader digital strategy continues to be, without a doubt, one of our greatest opportunities as a company. Digital, of course, also allows us to deepen the relationships we already have with consumers by tailoring every interaction to their specific needs. Through Nike+, we've created an ecosystem that gives athletes access to their fitness history, training programs and their favorite gear every time they connect with NIKE. \r\nWe started on this journey 10 years ago with Nike+, and we've continued to evolve the digital experience for consumers through multiple sports in the world's most important markets in both men's and women's. You'll hear more from us about this space later in the fiscal year, but we're continuing our never-ending quest to make the digital experience simple and personal: simple, moving toward one access point for the best of NIKE; and personal, more and more tailored to the individual.\r\nWe're now entering one of the most exciting periods of sport. The second half of fiscal '16 is filled with some of the world's greatest sports moments: Super Bowl 50, the NBA All-Star Weekend, March Madness, Copa America, Euro '16 and, of course, the run-up to the Rio Olympics. In these moments, like the athletes we serve, NIKE is at the top of our game. And this year, you will see NIKE unlock innovation for athletes like never before. We have a full pipeline that will help Olympic athletes change the course of their sports and experiences that will change how all athletes train and run. I'm proud of this quarter and our incredible team behind the results. They are the reason NIKE continues to drive growth and value for our shareholders. And like me, they're all focused on continuing our momentum and delivering inspiring innovation to athletes everywhere for years to come.\r\nThank you, everyone, and now here's Trevor.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mark. Happy holidays, everyone. The NIKE Brand delivered another impressive quarter, demonstrating the tremendous momentum of the NIKE Brand. Let's take a look at the numbers. \r\nOn a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 13%, with double-digit growth across every geography and most key categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 26%, driven by 13% comp store growth; continued strong growth in online sales, up 49%; and new store expansion. And we are very pleased with the continued strength in global futures, up 20%. \r\nAs always, these results are due to NIKE's world-class ability to understand the consumer, what they need and what inspires them. Those connections let us see the biggest growth opportunities and then sharpen our focus to best attack them. It's these powerful relationships that drive our category offense, providing us insights to create the innovative products, meaningful services and inspiring experiences that athletes all over the world love. \r\nLet me highlight 3 categories that demonstrate this powerful consumer focus. Let's first take a look at Running. Running is our largest performance category and continued to deliver strong results, with Q2 revenue growing at a double-digit rate. At NIKE, we know that running never stops. No matter the season, no matter the conditions, we provide solutions to help runners get out and pursue their goals. \r\nThis quarter, with winter setting in, we released our Flash Pack collection, which offers a reflective print to keep runners visible and warm in low-light conditions. The Flash Pack includes apparel such as the Aeroloft Flash Vest and the Shield Flash Running Jacket as well as great footwear, including the popular Air Zoom Pegasus and the Air Zoom Structure 19. All told, this collection offers yet another great example of how NIKE innovates to expand the market.\r\nOther running footwear successes in Q2 include the launch of the Air Zoom Odyssey, which offers 3 densities of foam for maximum stability and support; and the Air Max 2016 with its complete cushioning and durable ride, thanks to a full-length Max Air unit. At the same time, as part of our continued Amplify Strategy, we expand our performance with Pinnacle sportswear products to enable our consumers to express their love of sport. Part of this strategy is a constant focus on sports style innovation. In our Running-inspired sportswear, we are driving a steady stream of great products with strong sell-through. These include the Tech Pack and the Tech Fleece Aeroloft apparel styles as well as the continued success of the Roshe and the new Air Max Ultra line. Finally, our Pinnacle products are always complemented by unique experiences as only NIKE can do. Every year, Q2 is a season for some of the most popular running events, including the Shanghai Marathon and the Women's Half Marathon in San Francisco. The enthusiasm we see at these races echoes throughout the entire Running category year-after-year.\r\nNext, Basketball. For years, we have built deep and meaningful relationships with basketball fans through 2 of the largest most powerful brands in the world, NIKE and Jordan. Together, we have the deepest roster of athletes and the most global reach with federations and leagues around the world. As we said in October, we will start breaking out the Jordan Brand separately from Nike Basketball, so I'll give you a few highlights from both. \r\nIn Nike Basketball, we saw a mid-single-digit growth in Q2, fueled by key products such as the Kyrie 1. This product delivers responsive cushioning with Zoom Air and ultra-support with the Hyperfuse construction, and it has seen tremendous sell-through since the launch a year ago. And just last week, we launched -- the launch of the Kyrie 2 has already seen strong consumer response with a first-of-its-kind curved midsole and outsole designed to enhance the rapid cuts that players make on the court. \r\nAnother example of Basketball innovation is the recently introduced KOBE 11, a high-performance low-top that utilizes the latest Flyknit technology for lightweight strength, a stronger iteration to achieve peak performance. Our athletes always serve as an amazing source of inspiration for us, from Lebron and KD to young players having incredible seasons like Paul George and Anthony Davis. These athletes and more are featured in our latest Basketball campaign, Bring Your Game. This campaign will launch in full on Christmas Day to inspire and motivate young players to bring the best to the court every single day. And speaking of great athletes featured in the campaign, Elena Delle Donne won the WNBA's Most Valuable Player, which was awarded just before the launch of our new Women's Basketball collection. The sell-through has been beyond strong, and with women making up roughly 40% of basketball players, we are just scratching the surface on how we can serve this growing community.\r\nAs we continue to sharpen our focus on Running, a complete offense in Nike Basketball, we are excited about the deep pipeline of products we will be bringing to the market in the coming seasons, all of which help us capture the significant potential that lies ahead. \r\nNow for the Jordan Brand. This is the start of an exciting new era for Jordan. Even as we expand this brand both globally and into other categories, Jordan's Basketball products continue to be the most coveted and premium on the market. This brand proves time and again its ability to combine its iconic silhouettes with fresh styles. \r\nFor Q2, Jordan delivered strong double-digit growth with the new CP3.IX and the launch of the Air Jordan XX9 Low driving incredible consumer response. Like Nike Basketball, Jordan has a deep roster of elite players, including Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook. What's more, in October, Michael Jordan himself visited basketball fans in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo to celebrate the brand's 30th anniversary, helping to ignite the culture of basketball around the world. His visit drove strong consumer engagement with the new Jordan House of Flight in Shanghai and the flight training camps for young players across the markets. These cultural moments prove what we already know: that the power of this brand extends well beyond the game.\r\nAll of this excitement can be seen at retail, highlighted by the Jordan executions with Dick's Sporting Goods and the energy-packed opening of our new Jordan store on State Street in Chicago, a great execution with Footaction. This store will operate as a pinnacle retail experience, celebrating the performance, style and soul of the brand. What's more, directly above the store is a training lab serving elite high school athletes in the local area. Our consumers' passion for both the NIKE and Jordan Brands is driving tremendous energy and speaks to the significant opportunity that remains for our Basketball business around the world.\r\nNow let's take a look at a few of our key geographies. North America had another strong quarter, with revenues up 10% and futures up 14%. This geography continues to drive strong growth across most key categories. Whilst this is our most developed market, North America proves that the right strategies can drive consistent profitable growth. Our brand in North America has never been stronger with men, with women, with athletes in all sports. We are seeing continued strong demand across our executions with wholesale partners such as Foot Locker and Dick's Sporting Goods. Our own DTC business also had another strong quarter, up 17%, led by ongoing strength in NIKE.com and comp store growth.\r\nAs we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work effectively to manage the flow of product in North America and efficiently clear excess inventory. We are also continuing to work to bring our new North American distribution center fully online. Both of these efforts are making good progress. We expect inventory levels in North America to normalize over the balance of the fiscal year as we continue to take appropriate actions to maintain a healthy pull market for the NIKE Brand. Looking ahead, we see nothing but long-term potential for our North American business.\r\nNow let's turn to Western Europe where we see broad-based demand with strong revenue growth of 12% in the quarter and futures up 25%. We fueled growth in Q2 by continuing to transform the marketplace along the category offense with elevated executions at JD Sports, Foot Locker and Intersport. In addition, our own DTC business delivered 26% growth in the quarter. This growth from Western Europe is what we've come to expect with key categories of Sportswear and Global Football showing continued strength. This momentum has solidified NIKE as the region's most coveted sports brand with strong growth across all territories. This geography-wide market growth, coupled with market share gains, proves the clear success of our efforts in Western Europe and the vast potential this geography offers for years to come.\r\nIn the emerging markets, we are seeing improved revenue growth, with Q2 revenues up 11% and futures growth of 14%. Growth in the quarter was driven by most territories, with particular strength in Mexico as we continued to benefit from our reset efforts over the last year. We also saw strong growth in the key categories of Sportswear and Running. \r\nNow in Brazil, revenue was down 6%, reflective of the continued challenges in the macroeconomic landscape. Our brand remains strong in Brazil, and we're gaining share as we remain focused on our strategy of resetting the market along the category offense. As we focus on differentiating our points of distribution and proactively managing the flow of product into the marketplace, retail inventory levels in Brazil remain healthy.\r\nWe continue to focus on creating more compelling consumer experiences at retail and online and driving increased productivity and profitability for NIKE and our wholesale partners. Overall, we continue to see tremendous long-term growth potential for the emerging markets, and we remain focused on doing the right things in the marketplace to capture that growth. \r\nLastly, Greater China had another amazing quarter, with revenue growth of 28%. The strength of the NIKE Brand is fueling strong consumer demand with futures up 34% in a marketplace that continues to be very healthy. We saw strong growth across nearly all categories in the quarter, led by Sportswear, Running and NIKE Basketball. We also saw a continued strong growth from our own DTC business, up 51% in the quarter, fueled in part by our most successful Singles Day event ever. And NIKE.com is showing extraordinary growth in China in one of the most mobile and connected countries on the planet. The success we're seeing today in China stems from decisions we made of just a few years ago to align our teams against the biggest opportunities to drive growth with our category offense. By staying focused and diligent, we continue to lead the market as the region's most coveted sports brand, and we see significantly more opportunity ahead.\r\n2015 was the single greatest calendar year ever for the NIKE Brand. It proves yet again that we have the product, the services and the brand experiences that consumers want. And as we find new ways to surprise and delight athletes around the world, there's no telling what we can do. I can't wait for 2016 and the inspiration and innovation I know we're going to bring. And now here's Andy. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mike and Trevor, and happy holidays to everyone on the call. Q2 was another strong quarter for NIKE. We delivered on our goals in terms of both top line growth and profitability. We also continued to have strong momentum across our uniquely diverse global portfolio of businesses. We are driving and delivering these strong financial results even amidst a volatile macroeconomic environment, and we continue to do so by: one, staying relentlessly focused on creating value for our consumers, leading with innovation; two, effectively managing all of the operating and financial levers within our business to capture value for NIKE; and three, deploying our capital strategically to fuel long-term growth while also consistently expanding total returns to shareholders.\r\nI'll briefly touch on how we delivered against each of those 3 dimensions within the quarter. First, by executing the category offense, we continue to more deeply serve and create value for our consumers around the world. In Q2, that translated into double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographies on a currency-neutral basis. As both Mark and Trevor highlighted, we served consumers through the launch of innovative new products in multiple categories, and we also scaled recent product innovations such as Tech Pack, Aeroloft and Flyknit more broadly across our performance categories and Sportswear. At the same time, we continue to transform where and how we serve our consumers, leading with the expansion of NIKE.com while also scaling premium category-oriented retail experiences with our partners around the world.\r\nIn Q2, we also effectively managed all of the operating and financial levers within our business to translate our strong top line growth into expanding profitability. That included gross margin expansion through sustained strategic pricing and product cost management as well as leveraging productivity gains to ensure we deliver appropriate near-term profitability while also continuing to make the investments required to fuel our long-term growth. Those investments included, for example, accelerating our investment in product innovation, building critical operating infrastructure within our supply chain and from a technology perspective and investing to maintain a healthy pull market in North America in service of the continued strong demand for our brand.\r\nWhat sets NIKE apart in terms of operating and financial management is our ability to strike the right balance between the short and the long term. Our goal is to win now and create the future. And the breadth and depth of our global portfolio of businesses affords us the flexibility to strike that balance quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year. \r\nFinally, as we created value for consumers and captured that value for NIKE, we also continued to deliver significant value to our shareholders. Our top priority in terms of the use of our cash will remain reinvesting in our business against opportunities to drive growth and strong returns. That's what we call the virtuous cycle that sustains NIKE's leadership position and expands the value of our enterprise. \r\nThe strong cash flows that we generate also allow us to consistently increase our cash returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As Mark touched on, in the second quarter, we announced a new $12 billion 4-year share repurchase program and a 14% increase in our cash dividend. Over the last 15 years, we have sustained strategic investment in the business while also returning nearly $25 billion to shareholders. That is a track record that we're proud of and one that we will continue to build upon.\r\nNow I'll turn to a more detailed review of our Q2 financial results. Q2\r\nreported revenue for NIKE Inc. increased 4% and grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis. The NIKE Brand grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis as growth was strong across all geographies and nearly all categories. Converse revenue declined 5% on a currency-neutral basis as growth in North America and Asia Pacific was more than offset by declines in Europe, particularly the U.K.\r\nAlso on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 20%, reflecting continued strong demand, driven by a 12% increase in units, with an increase in average selling prices contributing 8 percentage points. Our futures growth reflects the strength of our brand and business around the globe, with all geographies growing at a double-digit pace. On a reported basis, futures grew 15%, taking into account the stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies.\r\nQ2 diluted EPS grew 22% to $0.90, despite significant FX headwinds. EPS growth was driven by strong top line growth, gross margin expansion and effective financial management across all of the levers through to the bottom line. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 45.6%, primarily driven by higher average selling prices, partially offset by higher product input costs and unfavorable foreign exchange.\r\nQ2 demand creation was flat, reflecting favorability from the quarterly timing of our investments in the current versus prior year. Operating overhead increased 7% for the quarter, driven by costs associated with strong growth in our DTC business and investments in operational infrastructure and consumer-facing digital capabilities.\r\nOur effective tax rate was 19.1% for Q2, lower than prior year, primarily due to adjustments to tax expense on intercompany transactions in the prior year and an increase in the mix of earnings from operations outside the U.S. in the current year which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. Those favorable factors were partially offset by benefits from the resolution of several tax audits recognized in the prior year.\r\nAs of November 30, our inventories were up 11%, primarily to support strong wholesale and owned retail demand as reflected in our futures orders. Overall, our inventories continue to be healthy around the world. As we noted last quarter, our inventory in North America will be somewhat elevated over the balance of the fiscal year as we proactively manage the marketplace. More expeditiously, clearing high-quality but excess inventory, while bringing a strong pipeline of new innovative products to the market over the same horizon. These efforts will unfavorably impact gross margin in the near term which is reflected in our guidance for the balance of this fiscal year.\r\nNow let's review our performance by segment. North America revenue grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis, with double-digit revenue growth across many of our largest categories including Jordan, Sportswear, Running and Men's Training. We continue to experience strong consumer demand for the NIKE Brand in North America as evidenced by futures growth of 14%. On a reported basis, North America grew 9% and EBIT grew 12% as revenue growth and SG&A leverage more than offset a slight decline in gross margin, resulting from the clearance of inventory.\r\nMoving on to Western Europe. Revenue increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in every territory. The implementation of our category offense across jurisdictional lines continues to drive strong and sustainable growth for NIKE in this geography. Most categories delivered strong growth, led by Sportswear and Global Football. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue declined 1% due to weakness in the euro. However, EBIT increased 18%, primarily driven by gross margin expansion.\r\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, Q2 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in most territories, except Greece, which declined. Most categories also grew double digits, led by Sportswear, Running and Global Football. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue declined 6%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, in particular, the ruble and the Turkish lira. However, EBIT grew 33% due to strong gross margin expansion. \r\nIn Greater China, we continue to deliver extraordinary revenue growth, with Q2 revenue up 28% on a currency-neutral basis. The NIKE Brand continues to lead in China, transforming the marketplace to better serve consumers. As a result, our growth is strong across nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear, Running, Nike Basketball and Jordan. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue increased 24% and EBIT grew 27% due to very strong revenue growth, coupled with gross margin expansion.\r\nIn our emerging markets geography, Q2 revenue increased 11% on a currency-neutral basis as most territories delivered strong growth in the quarter, driven by Soco, Mexico and Pacific while Brazil declined. Nearly every key category also grew in the quarter, led by Sportswear and Running. On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue declined 8% for the quarter due to foreign currency headwinds while EBIT increased 2%, reflecting strong gross margin expansion.\r\nWhile we have momentum in most territories within the emerging markets, as Trevor discussed, we are continuing to reset Brazil. While we are taking share and inventory levels at retail are healthy, our focus is on fueling long-term growth through more elevated category experiences in that marketplace.\r\nShifting from the NIKE Brand to Converse. Converse revenue declined 5% on a currency-neutral basis in Q2, with growth in North America and other developing markets offset by declines in certain European countries, primarily the U.K. The Converse brand remains incredibly strong around the world. And to help realize the full potential of the brand going forward, we're more actively leveraging NIKE capabilities and innovation platforms to diversify the Converse product portfolio as well as elevate our operating capabilities in recently transitioned international markets. On a reported basis, Converse revenue declined 8%, primarily due to the weaker euro and EBIT decreased 3% for the quarter, driven primarily by lower revenue and gross margin.\r\nNIKE Inc. delivered strong financial performance over the first half of fiscal year '16 and we have significant momentum across our global portfolio. As a result, our outlook for the full year remains consistent. Specifically, for Q3, we expect reported revenue to grow at a high single- to low double-digit rate, reflecting mid-teens growth on a currency-neutral basis, somewhat offset by the impact of the strong dollar.\r\nWhile our futures growth is higher than our Q3 revenue guidance, it is important to remember that revenue expectations in any given fiscal period can be impacted by several factors, including, for example, the weighting of futures by month, the flow of product into the market within a season, the timing of shipments to our wholesale customers as well as the timing of sell-through to our consumers in our DTC business. For the full year, we continue to expect reported revenue growth will be in the mid-single-digit range.\r\nWe expect gross margin for Q3 to be down by about 50 basis points, reflecting our efforts to more expeditiously clear inventory in North America while bringing new innovative products to market. For the full year, we continue to expect gross margin to expand by about 50 basis points, reflecting our strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year, combined with our current expectations for Q3 and Q4. \r\nFor total SG&A, we expect Q3 to grow at a low to mid-teens rate, reflecting our continued investments in DTC, consumer-facing digital capabilities, infrastructure and key brand events such as Super Bowl 50, the NBA All-Star Weekend and the timing of brand campaigns in support of select strategic categories. For the full year, we continue to expect total SG&A will grow at a high single-digit rate.\r\nWe continue to anticipate that other income will have a more meaningful impact on our fiscal year '16 results than we have seen historically, as a portion of our expected FX hedge gains are reported in this line item. Absent further changes in FX, we expect other income will be about $30 million for each of the next 2 quarters.\r\nWe now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 20% for the full year, reflecting the lower rate in the first half of the fiscal year and an average rate of about 22% for the second half of the fiscal year.\r\nQ2 was another quarter of strong revenue growth and expanding profitability for NIKE. As we embark on the second half of our fiscal year, we have brand and business momentum. We are on the offense and we will remain disciplined financially, as always, to ensure that we deliver appropriate growth and profitability in the near term while also investing strategically for the long term. NIKE is on track to deliver another year of strong financial performance and returns to shareholders. \r\nWith that, we'll now open it up for questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nThank you, operator, and happy holidays, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2016 second quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, investors.nike.com. \r\nJoining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand; and finally, we'll hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Andy Campion, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] \r\nI'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nThank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone, and happy holidays. Q2 was another strong quarter for NIKE. We continued to show that we have the ability to drive both profitable growth and significant shareholder value over the long term. \r\nLet's take a look at the highlights from the second quarter. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 4% to $7.7 billion despite continued FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 12%. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points and earnings per share increased 22% to $0.90.\r\nThe success you see today and the opportunities ahead are driven by the strength of our portfolio. NIKE has many dimensions to our business, and together, they're operating powerfully and efficiently. We're connecting deeply with consumers through products and experiences and capturing value through our strategic -- through our strategies and investments. Our complete offense, which includes our brands, geographies and categories, makes us flexible and keeps us close to the consumer so we can see and act on new opportunities in real time. We see it in the markets we transform like China and Western Europe and in the businesses we accelerate like Women's and the Jordan Brand. Our operational scale is second to none. We have the power to grow the entire marketplace and innovate through our global supply chain that shipped roughly 1.1 billion units this last year. And as we've shown consistently, everything we do is executed with a sharp focus and a financial discipline. We have a proven track record of delivering top line growth, expanding profitability and maintaining a high return on invested capital. And because we drive consistent profitable growth, we're able to deliver strong returns to our shareholders. For example, we recently announced a 4-year $12 billion share repurchase program. We increased our annual cash dividend for the 14th year in a row, and we announced a 2-for-1 stock split. It's clear we have the right plan in place against the backdrop of a global movement of fitness and sports. It's all adding up to incredible momentum for our business, but we're never fully satisfied. More than ever, we're focused on the areas where we can continue to get better and making the necessary changes to ensure we continue to drive strong profitable growth for the long term.\r\nThe force behind today's results and our future potential is, of course, innovation. Our obsession and relentless drive to be better is at the core of our culture and our strategy. And as you know, it starts with product. We invent breakthroughs then build a thriving business around them. We told you during our Investor Day how we've built Flyknit from a concept to a billion-dollar platform in just 4 years. This is the kind of search for scalable innovation that's going on every day at NIKE, and just as important is our focus on bringing innovations to market in a directed and productive way through merchandising and marketplace management across all channels and multiple price points.\r\nInnovation is also fueled by partnerships. When we partner, it can be like setting off a chain reaction, leading us to new and better ideas more quickly. It's why we value our relationships with athletes, NIKE's original and most important collaborators. Our relationships with thousands of athletes, teams and federations do more than build our brand. They give us personal access to their insights and the science behind the problems they need to solve. That's why we work with the best athletes like Lebron and Serena, Cristiano, along with everyday athletes, frankly like the rest of us. Partnerships also play a critical role in creating and expanding the marketplace. With our long-standing wholesale partners, we give consumers broad access to NIKE, and together, we segment and differentiate our assortments to drive mutually profitable retail.\r\nAt NIKE, collaboration is also a powerful strategy for activating new ways to work. As the clear leader in our industry, we align ourselves with leaders in other industries. To that end, we announced 2 new partnerships in October. The first is DreamWorks and their technology company called NOVA. With this partnership, we've combined the expertise of 2 design leaders: NIKE with the human body in motion and DreamWorks with the animated body in motion. I've been talking with our design teams and they see great potential in NOVA's platforms to advance our creation process in capability, precision and speed.\r\nThe second is Flex. Many of you know about the impressive work that Flex does, who are already accelerating our manufacturing revolution efforts. It's in the early stages yet, but in one specific process, they've combined automated material management with automated laser cutting, which can reduce waste by up to 50%. This is just one example of many that are in development, and what we learned from Flex, we expect to scale across our broad global source base. \r\nFor the consumer, our partnership has the potential to expand their list of choices and accelerate delivery times from weeks to months -- or I'm sorry, from weeks to days. Strike that. Both partnerships are at an intersection of another vital innovation driver and that's digital. At NIKE, digital does more than just add capabilities for today. It defines how consumers will experience the NIKE Brand moving forward. It's an accelerator across our business, in product through the supply chain, in analytics and all the way to retail. A few weeks ago, we shared our long-term vision for e-commerce growth, $7 billion in revenue by the end of fiscal year '20. In Q2, we continued our accelerated pace, growing the NIKE.com business nearly 50% on a constant-currency basis. We added Canada, Switzerland and Norway to our expanding list of e-commerce markets, and next quarter, we're planning to do the same for the sport-obsessed cultures of Mexico, Turkey and Chile. When we expand our NIKE.com footprint, it gives new consumers access to the best of NIKE and it drives great energy for our business.\r\nWe have focused our investments in digital and mobile over the last several years, and they're paying off. Driving the connection of NIKE.com to our broader digital strategy continues to be, without a doubt, one of our greatest opportunities as a company. Digital, of course, also allows us to deepen the relationships we already have with consumers by tailoring every interaction to their specific needs. Through Nike+, we've created an ecosystem that gives athletes access to their fitness history, training programs and their favorite gear every time they connect with NIKE. \r\nWe started on this journey 10 years ago with Nike+, and we've continued to evolve the digital experience for consumers through multiple sports in the world's most important markets in both men's and women's. You'll hear more from us about this space later in the fiscal year, but we're continuing our never-ending quest to make the digital experience simple and personal: simple, moving toward one access point for the best of NIKE; and personal, more and more tailored to the individual.\r\nWe're now entering one of the most exciting periods of sport. The second half of fiscal '16 is filled with some of the world's greatest sports moments: Super Bowl 50, the NBA All-Star Weekend, March Madness, Copa America, Euro '16 and, of course, the run-up to the Rio Olympics. In these moments, like the athletes we serve, NIKE is at the top of our game. And this year, you will see NIKE unlock innovation for athletes like never before. We have a full pipeline that will help Olympic athletes change the course of their sports and experiences that will change how all athletes train and run. I'm proud of this quarter and our incredible team behind the results. They are the reason NIKE continues to drive growth and value for our shareholders. And like me, they're all focused on continuing our momentum and delivering inspiring innovation to athletes everywhere for years to come.\r\nThank you, everyone, and now here's Trevor.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Andrew Campion (Executives)】\nThank you, Mark. Happy holidays, everyone. The NIKE Brand delivered another impressive quarter, demonstrating the tremendous momentum of the NIKE Brand. Let's take a look at the numbers. \r\nOn a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 13%, with double-digit growth across every geography and most key categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 26%, driven by 13% comp store growth; continued strong growth in online sales, up 49%; and new store expansion. And we are very pleased with the continued strength in global futures, up 20%. \r\nAs always, these results are due to NIKE's world-class ability to understand the consumer, what they need and what inspires them. Those connections let us see the biggest growth opportunities and then sharpen our focus to best attack them. It's these powerful relationships that drive our category offense, providing us insights to create the innovative products, meaningful services and inspiring experiences that athletes all over the world love. \r\nLet me highlight 3 categories that demonstrate this powerful consumer focus. Let's first take a look at Running. Running is our largest performance category and continued to deliver strong results, with Q2 revenue growing at a double-digit rate. At NIKE, we know that running never stops. No matter the season, no matter the conditions, we provide solutions to help runners get out and pursue their goals. \r\nThis quarter, with winter setting in, we released our Flash Pack collection, which offers a reflective print to keep runners visible and warm in low-light conditions. The Flash Pack includes apparel such as the Aeroloft Flash Vest and the Shield Flash Running Jacket as well as great footwear, including the popular Air Zoom Pegasus and the Air Zoom Structure 19. All told, this collection offers yet another great example of how NIKE innovates to expand the market.\r\nOther running footwear successes in Q2 include the launch of the Air Zoom Odyssey, which offers 3 densities of foam for maximum stability and support; and the Air Max 2016 with its complete cushioning and durable ride, thanks to a full-length Max Air unit. At the same time, as part of our continued Amplify Strategy, we expand our performance with Pinnacle sportswear products to enable our consumers to express their love of sport. Part of this strategy is a constant focus on sports style innovation. In our Running-inspired sportswear, we are driving a steady stream of great products with strong sell-through. These include the Tech Pack and the Tech Fleece Aeroloft apparel styles as well as the continued success of the Roshe and the new Air Max Ultra line. Finally, our Pinnacle products are always complemented by unique experiences as only NIKE can do. Every year, Q2 is a season for some of the most popular running events, including the Shanghai Marathon and the Women's Half Marathon in San Francisco. The enthusiasm we see at these races echoes throughout the entire Running category year-after-year.\r\nNext, Basketball. For years, we have built deep and meaningful relationships with basketball fans through 2 of the largest most powerful brands in the world, NIKE and Jordan. Together, we have the deepest roster of athletes and the most global reach with federations and leagues around the world. As we said in October, we will start breaking out the Jordan Brand separately from Nike Basketball, so I'll give you a few highlights from both. \r\nIn Nike Basketball, we saw a mid-single-digit growth in Q2, fueled by key products such as the Kyrie 1. This product delivers responsive cushioning with Zoom Air and ultra-support with the Hyperfuse construction, and it has seen tremendous sell-through since the launch a year ago. And just last week, we launched -- the launch of the Kyrie 2 has already seen strong consumer response with a first-of-its-kind curved midsole and outsole designed to enhance the rapid cuts that players make on the court. \r\nAnother example of Basketball innovation is the recently introduced KOBE 11, a high-performance low-top that utilizes the latest Flyknit technology for lightweight strength, a stronger iteration to achieve peak performance. Our athletes always serve as an amazing source of inspiration for us, from Lebron and KD to young players having incredible seasons like Paul George and Anthony Davis. These athletes and more are featured in our latest Basketball campaign, Bring Your Game. This campaign will launch in full on Christmas Day to inspire and motivate young players to bring the best to the court every single day. And speaking of great athletes featured in the campaign, Elena Delle Donne won the WNBA's Most Valuable Player, which was awarded just before the launch of our new Women's Basketball collection. The sell-through has been beyond strong, and with women making up roughly 40% of basketball players, we are just scratching the surface on how we can serve this growing community.\r\nAs we continue to sharpen our focus on Running, a complete offense in Nike Basketball, we are excited about the deep pipeline of products we will be bringing to the market in the coming seasons, all of which help us capture the significant potential that lies ahead. \r\nNow for the Jordan Brand. This is the start of an exciting new era for Jordan. Even as we expand this brand both globally and into other categories, Jordan's Basketball products continue to be the most coveted and premium on the market. This brand proves time and again its ability to combine its iconic silhouettes with fresh styles. \r\nFor Q2, Jordan delivered strong double-digit growth with the new CP3.IX and the launch of the Air Jordan XX9 Low driving incredible consumer response. Like Nike Basketball, Jordan has a deep roster of elite players, including Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook. What's more, in October, Michael Jordan himself visited basketball fans in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo to celebrate the brand's 30th anniversary, helping to ignite the culture of basketball around the world. His visit drove strong consumer engagement with the new Jordan House of Flight in Shanghai and the flight training camps for young players across the markets. These cultural moments prove what we already know: that the power of this brand extends well beyond the game.\r\nAll of this excitement can be seen at retail, highlighted by the Jordan executions with Dick's Sporting Goods and the energy-packed opening of our new Jordan store on State Street in Chicago, a great execution with Footaction. This store will operate as a pinnacle retail experience, celebrating the performance, style and soul of the brand. What's more, directly above the store is a training lab serving elite high school athletes in the local area. Our consumers' passion for both the NIKE and Jordan Brands is driving tremendous energy and speaks to the significant opportunity that remains for our Basketball business around the world.\r\nNow let's take a look at a few of our key geographies. North America had another strong quarter, with revenues up 10% and futures up 14%. This geography continues to drive strong growth across most key categories. Whilst this is our most developed market, North America proves that the right strategies can drive consistent profitable growth. Our brand in North America has never been stronger with men, with women, with athletes in all sports. We are seeing continued strong demand across our executions with wholesale partners such as Foot Locker and Dick's Sporting Goods. Our own DTC business also had another strong quarter, up 17%, led by ongoing strength in NIKE.com and comp store growth.\r\nAs we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work effectively to manage the flow of product in North America and efficiently clear excess inventory. We are also continuing to work to bring our new North American distribution center fully online. Both of these efforts are making good progress. We expect inventory levels in North America to normalize over the balance of the fiscal year as we continue to take appropriate actions to maintain a healthy pull market for the NIKE Brand. Looking ahead, we see nothing but long-term potential for our North American business.\r\nNow let's turn to Western Europe where we see broad-based demand with strong revenue growth of 12% in the quarter and futures up 25%. We fueled growth in Q2 by continuing to transform the marketplace along the category offense with elevated executions at JD Sports, Foot Locker and Intersport. In addition, our own DTC business delivered 26% growth in the quarter. This growth from Western Europe is what we've come to expect with key categories of Sportswear and Global Football showing continued strength. This momentum has solidified NIKE as the region's most coveted sports brand with strong growth across all territories. This geography-wide market growth, coupled with market share gains, proves the clear success of our efforts in Western Europe and the vast potential this geography offers for years to come.\r\nIn the emerging markets, we are seeing improved revenue growth, with Q2 revenues up 11% and futures growth of 14%. Growth in the quarter was driven by most territories, with particular strength in Mexico as we continued to benefit from our reset efforts over the last year. We also saw strong growth in the key categories of Sportswear and Running. \r\nNow in Brazil, revenue was down 6%, reflective of the continued challenges in the macroeconomic landscape. Our brand remains strong in Brazil, and we're gaining share as we remain focused on our strategy of resetting the market along the category offense. As we focus on differentiating our points of distribution and proactively managing the flow of product into the marketplace, retail inventory levels in Brazil remain healthy.\r\nWe continue to focus on creating more compelling consumer experiences at retail and online and driving increased productivity and profitability for NIKE and our wholesale partners. Overall, we continue to see tremendous long-term growth potential for the emerging markets, and we remain focused on doing the right things in the marketplace to capture that growth. \r\nLastly, Greater China had another amazing quarter, with revenue growth of 28%. The strength of the NIKE Brand is fueling strong consumer demand with futures up 34% in a marketplace that continues to be very healthy. We saw strong growth across nearly all categories in the quarter, led by Sportswear, Running and NIKE Basketball. We also saw a continued strong growth from our own DTC business, up 51% in the quarter, fueled in part by our most successful Singles Day event ever. And NIKE.com is showing extraordinary growth in China in one of the most mobile and connected countries on the planet. The success we're seeing today in China stems from decisions we made of just a few years ago to align our teams against the biggest opportunities to drive growth with our category offense. By staying focused and diligent, we continue to lead the market as the region's most coveted sports brand, and we see significantly more opportunity ahead.\r\n2015 was the single greatest calendar year ever for the NIKE Brand. It proves yet again that we have the product, the services and the brand experiences that consumers want. And as we find new ways to surprise and delight athletes around the world, there's no telling what we can do. I can't wait for 2016 and the inspiration and innovation I know we're going to bring. And now here's Andy. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Andrew Campion (Executives)】\nThanks, Mike and Trevor, and happy holidays to everyone on the call. Q2 was another strong quarter for NIKE. We delivered on our goals in terms of both top line growth and profitability. We also continued to have strong momentum across our uniquely diverse global portfolio of businesses. We are driving and delivering these strong financial results even amidst a volatile macroeconomic environment, and we continue to do so by: one, staying relentlessly focused on creating value for our consumers, leading with innovation; two, effectively managing all of the operating and financial levers within our business to capture value for NIKE; and three, deploying our capital strategically to fuel long-term growth while also consistently expanding total returns to shareholders.\r\nI'll briefly touch on how we delivered against each of those 3 dimensions within the quarter. First, by executing the category offense, we continue to more deeply serve and create value for our consumers around the world. In Q2, that translated into double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographies on a currency-neutral basis. As both Mark and Trevor highlighted, we served consumers through the launch of innovative new products in multiple categories, and we also scaled recent product innovations such as Tech Pack, Aeroloft and Flyknit more broadly across our performance categories and Sportswear. At the same time, we continue to transform where and how we serve our consumers, leading with the expansion of NIKE.com while also scaling premium category-oriented retail experiences with our partners around the world.\r\nIn Q2, we also effectively managed all of the operating and financial levers within our business to translate our strong top line growth into expanding profitability. That included gross margin expansion through sustained strategic pricing and product cost management as well as leveraging productivity gains to ensure we deliver appropriate near-term profitability while also continuing to make the investments required to fuel our long-term growth. Those investments included, for example, accelerating our investment in product innovation, building critical operating infrastructure within our supply chain and from a technology perspective and investing to maintain a healthy pull market in North America in service of the continued strong demand for our brand.\r\nWhat sets NIKE apart in terms of operating and financial management is our ability to strike the right balance between the short and the long term. Our goal is to win now and create the future. And the breadth and depth of our global portfolio of businesses affords us the flexibility to strike that balance quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year. \r\nFinally, as we created value for consumers and captured that value for NIKE, we also continued to deliver significant value to our shareholders. Our top priority in terms of the use of our cash will remain reinvesting in our business against opportunities to drive growth and strong returns. That's what we call the virtuous cycle that sustains NIKE's leadership position and expands the value of our enterprise. \r\nThe strong cash flows that we generate also allow us to consistently increase our cash returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As Mark touched on, in the second quarter, we announced a new $12 billion 4-year share repurchase program and a 14% increase in our cash dividend. Over the last 15 years, we have sustained strategic investment in the business while also returning nearly $25 billion to shareholders. That is a track record that we're proud of and one that we will continue to build upon.\r\nNow I'll turn to a more detailed review of our Q2 financial results. Q2\r\nreported revenue for NIKE Inc. increased 4% and grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis. The NIKE Brand grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis as growth was strong across all geographies and nearly all categories. Converse revenue declined 5% on a currency-neutral basis as growth in North America and Asia Pacific was more than offset by declines in Europe, particularly the U.K.\r\nAlso on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 20%, reflecting continued strong demand, driven by a 12% increase in units, with an increase in average selling prices contributing 8 percentage points. Our futures growth reflects the strength of our brand and business around the globe, with all geographies growing at a double-digit pace. On a reported basis, futures grew 15%, taking into account the stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies.\r\nQ2 diluted EPS grew 22% to $0.90, despite significant FX headwinds. EPS growth was driven by strong top line growth, gross margin expansion and effective financial management across all of the levers through to the bottom line. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 45.6%, primarily driven by higher average selling prices, partially offset by higher product input costs and unfavorable foreign exchange.\r\nQ2 demand creation was flat, reflecting favorability from the quarterly timing of our investments in the current versus prior year. Operating overhead increased 7% for the quarter, driven by costs associated with strong growth in our DTC business and investments in operational infrastructure and consumer-facing digital capabilities.\r\nOur effective tax rate was 19.1% for Q2, lower than prior year, primarily due to adjustments to tax expense on intercompany transactions in the prior year and an increase in the mix of earnings from operations outside the U.S. in the current year which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. Those favorable factors were partially offset by benefits from the resolution of several tax audits recognized in the prior year.\r\nAs of November 30, our inventories were up 11%, primarily to support strong wholesale and owned retail demand as reflected in our futures orders. Overall, our inventories continue to be healthy around the world. As we noted last quarter, our inventory in North America will be somewhat elevated over the balance of the fiscal year as we proactively manage the marketplace. More expeditiously, clearing high-quality but excess inventory, while bringing a strong pipeline of new innovative products to the market over the same horizon. These efforts will unfavorably impact gross margin in the near term which is reflected in our guidance for the balance of this fiscal year.\r\nNow let's review our performance by segment. North America revenue grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis, with double-digit revenue growth across many of our largest categories including Jordan, Sportswear, Running and Men's Training. We continue to experience strong consumer demand for the NIKE Brand in North America as evidenced by futures growth of 14%. On a reported basis, North America grew 9% and EBIT grew 12% as revenue growth and SG&A leverage more than offset a slight decline in gross margin, resulting from the clearance of inventory.\r\nMoving on to Western Europe. Revenue increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in every territory. The implementation of our category offense across jurisdictional lines continues to drive strong and sustainable growth for NIKE in this geography. Most categories delivered strong growth, led by Sportswear and Global Football. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue declined 1% due to weakness in the euro. However, EBIT increased 18%, primarily driven by gross margin expansion.\r\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, Q2 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in most territories, except Greece, which declined. Most categories also grew double digits, led by Sportswear, Running and Global Football. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue declined 6%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, in particular, the ruble and the Turkish lira. However, EBIT grew 33% due to strong gross margin expansion. \r\nIn Greater China, we continue to deliver extraordinary revenue growth, with Q2 revenue up 28% on a currency-neutral basis. The NIKE Brand continues to lead in China, transforming the marketplace to better serve consumers. As a result, our growth is strong across nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear, Running, Nike Basketball and Jordan. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue increased 24% and EBIT grew 27% due to very strong revenue growth, coupled with gross margin expansion.\r\nIn our emerging markets geography, Q2 revenue increased 11% on a currency-neutral basis as most territories delivered strong growth in the quarter, driven by Soco, Mexico and Pacific while Brazil declined. Nearly every key category also grew in the quarter, led by Sportswear and Running. On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue declined 8% for the quarter due to foreign currency headwinds while EBIT increased 2%, reflecting strong gross margin expansion.\r\nWhile we have momentum in most territories within the emerging markets, as Trevor discussed, we are continuing to reset Brazil. While we are taking share and inventory levels at retail are healthy, our focus is on fueling long-term growth through more elevated category experiences in that marketplace.\r\nShifting from the NIKE Brand to Converse. Converse revenue declined 5% on a currency-neutral basis in Q2, with growth in North America and other developing markets offset by declines in certain European countries, primarily the U.K. The Converse brand remains incredibly strong around the world. And to help realize the full potential of the brand going forward, we're more actively leveraging NIKE capabilities and innovation platforms to diversify the Converse product portfolio as well as elevate our operating capabilities in recently transitioned international markets. On a reported basis, Converse revenue declined 8%, primarily due to the weaker euro and EBIT decreased 3% for the quarter, driven primarily by lower revenue and gross margin.\r\nNIKE Inc. delivered strong financial performance over the first half of fiscal year '16 and we have significant momentum across our global portfolio. As a result, our outlook for the full year remains consistent. Specifically, for Q3, we expect reported revenue to grow at a high single- to low double-digit rate, reflecting mid-teens growth on a currency-neutral basis, somewhat offset by the impact of the strong dollar.\r\nWhile our futures growth is higher than our Q3 revenue guidance, it is important to remember that revenue expectations in any given fiscal period can be impacted by several factors, including, for example, the weighting of futures by month, the flow of product into the market within a season, the timing of shipments to our wholesale customers as well as the timing of sell-through to our consumers in our DTC business. For the full year, we continue to expect reported revenue growth will be in the mid-single-digit range.\r\nWe expect gross margin for Q3 to be down by about 50 basis points, reflecting our efforts to more expeditiously clear inventory in North America while bringing new innovative products to market. For the full year, we continue to expect gross margin to expand by about 50 basis points, reflecting our strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year, combined with our current expectations for Q3 and Q4. \r\nFor total SG&A, we expect Q3 to grow at a low to mid-teens rate, reflecting our continued investments in DTC, consumer-facing digital capabilities, infrastructure and key brand events such as Super Bowl 50, the NBA All-Star Weekend and the timing of brand campaigns in support of select strategic categories. For the full year, we continue to expect total SG&A will grow at a high single-digit rate.\r\nWe continue to anticipate that other income will have a more meaningful impact on our fiscal year '16 results than we have seen historically, as a portion of our expected FX hedge gains are reported in this line item. Absent further changes in FX, we expect other income will be about $30 million for each of the next 2 quarters.\r\nWe now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 20% for the full year, reflecting the lower rate in the first half of the fiscal year and an average rate of about 22% for the second half of the fiscal year.\r\nQ2 was another quarter of strong revenue growth and expanding profitability for NIKE. As we embark on the second half of our fiscal year, we have brand and business momentum. We are on the offense and we will remain disciplined financially, as always, to ensure that we deliver appropriate growth and profitability in the near term while also investing strategically for the long term. NIKE is on track to deliver another year of strong financial performance and returns to shareholders. \r\nWith that, we'll now open it up for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Just a couple of questions. The first one really is when you look at the -- I think the future orders going into the next 6 months and specifically, China and Japan, can you just elaborate a little bit more in terms of what's the acceleration that's going on there? And I guess, how you plan to run the business, reinvest in the business or leverage some of that strong revenue growth?\n\n---\n\nSure, Bob. I was just continue to say that as it relates actually both to China and also Japan, I think first let's start with in both markets, we have incredible brand strength in both of those markets. And in China specifically, as you recall, we spent time resetting the marketplace and we are now seeing the results of that reset really take place. They had an incredible quarter. I was actually just recently there. We're seeing just great growth across the Sportswear, the Running, the Basketball business, the dotcom business is doing exceptionally well. And so also working with our key partners, the transformation efforts that we put in place are actually now really, really working well. So we see great sell-through in the market and we see really good health of the inventory. So all the dimensions really would say that China is in a great place. We feel confident about the long-term potential of the market. Similarly in Japan, with the futures, what we're certainly seeing in Japan is that they went through similar efforts to really make sure we stayed focused on the brand. We have an incredible pipeline of products come in. The DTC, the dotcom business is doing exceptionally well there too, and we continue to work with our partners really well, so a similar story in those marketplaces. Obviously, I think it all stems from great brand strength that gives us real great confidence about the long-term potential of both of those markets.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And I just had like one other additional question. So when you look over sort of the medium to longer term, did you get more value out of the Lebron lifetime contract or the $12 billion buyback program?\n\n---\n\nBoth of them will add value, Bob.\n\n---\n\nWe're bullish on both, no question. A fool's compromise.\n\n---\n\nMy question was around inventories. I know this has been in North America, something you've highlighted at least in the last quarter. Can you give us any more indication of what these inventories are, the composition of them? Is it in a particular category? Is it across the board? Any kind of additional insight and any more detail on how you'll be working through that in the third quarter?\n\n---\n\nSure thing. Overall, the excess inventory in North America is really current fresh product, and the largest portion of that really stems from the residual impact of the West Coast port congestion earlier this year. And it really consists of basically, product that was delayed. We proactively delayed some products in favor of priority products that we felt would actually work well in the marketplace. A smaller portion of the product is the stuff that didn't sell through as we would have liked in the marketplace, and we're clearing that as part of the normal course of business to really keep the in-line channel healthy and at the same time, allows us, gives us the room to bring in more new fresh products. So that's really what you see taking place. So our efforts in the back half of the year as we continue is to expeditiously clear the excess inventory through our robust network of factory stores, and we feel confident with the demand in the marketplace that we could efficiently move through the product.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And my second question is on Brazil. I think you used the word reset when you're talking about Brazil in your prepared comments. Is it similar to what you did in China or started in China a couple of years ago that you're starting to see positive results from? Or is there something else that you're doing in Brazil that is working towards driving that demand again?\n\n---\n\nYes, I'll take that again. I mean, I'd say that on Brazil, essentially, the brand is again very strong in the Brazilian marketplace. And obviously, with the macro economic conditions, it makes for a slightly different way of operating. But what we did say is that some of the fundamental things still remain the same which is that what we continue to do is work to transform that market along the lines of the category offense to ensure that we can bring more compelling consumer experiences to retail and online that will drive both productivity and profitability in the marketplace. So again, similar story but we're being very, very refined in Brazil. And we see this as a market for the long term and it has tremendous potential because it is a sports loving market, but we're certainly working through some of the opportunity that exists in that marketplace.\n\n---\n\nAnd Kate, all I'll add is to put it in financial terms, the macroeconomics obviously, are impacting overall growth in the market. But specific to NIKE, we are taking share. Inventory levels in the market remain healthy actually and that is due to some proactive efforts in our regard in terms of managing supply and demand. And so to Trevor's point, when we say reset, we're really talking about positioning that market along the category lines from a distribution perspective in that regard in similar ways as we've been in North America, China and Europe.\n\n---\n\nFirst question on gross margin. The guidance, I know you're working through some inventory next quarter, down 50 bps. But if you kind of look at your full year guidance, it implies a really nice bounce back in the fourth quarter gross margin somewhere in the 100, plus 100, 150 bps range. A, I want to make sure I'm kind of doing the calculation right and B, is that the right way to maybe think about the gross margin algorithm more along those lines once you work through the excess inventory in North America?\n\n---\n\nYes, Omar. You've got the different elements of the equation generally in line. As we mentioned, we've had gross margin expansion in the first half of the year, fueled by what we do season in, season out, our expansion in average gross selling price, our management of product costs, et cetera. What you're seeing in Q3 is more of a near-term impact and that relates to us more expeditiously clearing that high-quality but excess inventory in North America so that we can bring new innovative products to market over the balance of the year.\n\n---\n\nGreat, that's helpful. And then can I ask a question on apparel and pricing there? If you look at your ASPs over the last several quarters, a couple of years in footwear, it's really been strong. Apparel's been positive too. It seems like there's more innovation and more newness and more new technology you're bringing to the marketplace on apparel side. Can we maybe start thinking about the apparel business going through some of those premiumization elements that have really pervaded the Footwear business? Or is it premature to think along those lines or is there something different about the apparel market, it's more competitive? I don't know. How do you think about that?\n\n---\n\nWell, the apparel market is definitely different than the Footwear market. It's certainly competitive. We see the same opportunity to bring a premium performance position to apparel that we do in Footwear, however and that's our focus. We're actually accelerating our innovation efforts, advanced R&D program and some of our design for manufacturing efforts in Apparel are really aimed to try to elevate our performance position there. So we see some opportunities and frankly, that's our position of distinction in apparel, is to really solidify the performance, the authentic performance position and take that distinction and then drive it across the rest of our business, across the categories and from the performance apparel standpoint and through Sportswear. So that's definitely our plan and we feel quite bullish about it.\n\n---\n\nYes, I'll just add that what we also continued to do is we continue to attack segments within the apparel market by category that are offering a more premium position. For example in the Football market, the Global Football market, the opportunity to go after what we call football training is a great example of how we bring innovation to that segment. Similarly as we've done in Sportswear with the Tech Pack collection which is a very premium offering which is seeing tremendous success across the market all around the world. So these are just examples of ways that we continue to, as you said, see the premium priced opportunity, but make sure we're giving the consumers great value in the apparel business by bringing innovation to the marketplace.\n\n---\n\nAnd there's definitely a consumer appetite here.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to ask in North America, as you think about the way that you'll be able to efficiently push the excess inventory out, how much of that inventory, Trevor, you talked about using your outlet stores, how much of the inventory you expect to go through outlets versus the markdown in your regular wholesale through your regular retail partners versus any of the close out channels? And my second question is in currency, Andy, would you be able to tell us how much you expect the earnings per share impact of FX to be in 3Q and 4Q?\n\n---\n\nYes, I would just say, we expect that more of our inventory will be liquidated through our factory stores. Like we've said, we've got a robust network and we continue to feel very positive about the demand in the marketplace for the brand. And so for those consumers looking for a value occasion, we think we're providing great value at this -- particularly with the recency of some of these products.\n\n---\n\nAnd Lindsay, we don't provide forward-looking FX impact on earnings per share per se. But as we noted in the first half, FX did have a significant impact and we do expect that we'll continue to have significant impact in the second half.\n\n---\n\nA question on China really quickly. If we look at some the retailer -- your biggest retailers over there that are public companies that give us updates, they've done a nice job alongside you restoring their same-store sales growth, and that's obviously come after you guys have restricted inventories into that market to force the pull market, good habits on that market. If you look at some of those, the same-store sales rates have stabilized a bit or even decelerated from very high levels, maybe just a touch, but I'm willing to bet that some of those retailers are holding less inventory on hand than they have in the past. And now they're heading into store growth and into an Olympic year. Is there a point where we can think about the growth rate for you in China looking more like the same-store sales rates that we hear out of the market? And put another way, is there a point where you would say your growth rate there would stop benefiting from replenishing dated inventory on hand, for example, to your biggest retailers?\n\n---\n\nYes, Michael, I'll start on that one. Just to add a little bit of dimension in terms of China, we've had strong growth across a number of the dimensions in that market. Our same-store sales growth is strong and remains strong. I wouldn't necessarily call it as decelerating significantly or call it decelerating significantly, I think as you noted. In terms of the prospects going forward, one of the things we touched on in our Investor Day was how much of our retail footprint we have impacted with our new category-oriented strategies in the wholesale marketplace. And if you'll recall, the number we gave at the time was that we've touched about 20% of that market in terms of our re-profiled doors and our more consumer-focused, category-oriented experiences. Those experiences continue to have very healthy inventory, much faster turns than we experienced years ago, strong comps, margin expansion. And again, that's 20% of the market. We still believe we have a significant opportunity in that market to continue to proliferate that across wholesale. And then again, one of the other things fueling our growth in China is our DTC business and notably, NIKE.com as Trevor referenced.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And that's an interesting segue. When we think about the digital business going to $7 billion in revenues by 2020, would you mind talking to us about which categories or geographies the majority of that growth comes from? And how the mix of digital will look at that time compared to today which is very North America-weighted for you?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, the digital business obviously provides a tremendous opportunity for us. And I think as we often talk about, it really touches all dimensions of the company. As you look at the growth rate, the growth rates we're seeing really will come from all the different dimensions of the business. When you think about the undeserved categories as certainly, as we look at the Women's business, we look at the Young Athletes business, we look at the Jordan business, all of those really provide great opportunity to growth from a category perspective, along with the big categories that are already growing. I'd also say the same time that I think from a geographic perspective, while North America is currently one of the larger growing ones, China has a tremendous, tremendous growth opportunity. We can see that as being one of the most connected markets out there. Europe has continued growth opportunities. So we really do see as an expansive opportunity across the board. And obviously then, there is Central and Eastern Europe which we've continued to see growth. So it really is one of those cases where it's a global footprint and we just see more and more opportunity, the deeper we dive.\n\n---\n\nI guess, Andy, for you, I guess any color by any chance between on the futures number, front half, back half in terms of growth rates, any difference between the cadence?\n\n---\n\nYes. The futures are slightly more heavily weighted towards the back half. I would refer you back to some of my remarks in our guidance, though. There are a number of factors that are worth taking into account in terms of futures and especially as they relate to revenue. That being the weighting of futures across the season as compared to just across this monthly reporting window as well as shipping timing and other factors. But in short, in terms of just the weighting kind of first half or second half of the year futures reporting window, slightly more heavily weighted towards the second half.\n\n---\n\nI guess my second question pertains to the revenue outlook. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you said high single to low double-digit reported for Q3 but sustaining kind of a mid-single-digit growth on the year which is similar revenue growth that you gave on the last quarter despite the acceleration of futures, so which would imply I guess, a de-acceleration in revenue growth for Q4. Maybe walk us through so maybe why that will be the case or is it just being conservative, given the macro volatility? I'm just sort of curious for your thoughts about that.\n\n---\n\nYes. At first, what I would say is our full year guidance on revenue is consistent. So very much consistent with our guidance 90 days ago or in other words, unchanged. As we look at it, the balance of the year and you're looking to futures as a proxy, again, a number of factors and I touched on a few of those. There's also the timing of flowing product into the market around events and other factors, the timing of revenue recognition as you ship to wholesale customers as compared to shipping directly to consumers through our DTC business. So I refer you back to our guidance but the punchline on our guidance is that it remains consistent in terms of our full year revenue expectations.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Well, thank you, everyone. Have a great holiday season. Happy new year, and we'll talk to you in Q3.",

And now they're heading into store growth and into an Olympic year. Is there a point where we can think about the growth rate for you in China looking more like the same-store sales rates that we hear out of the market? And put another way, is there a point where you would say your growth rate there would stop benefiting from replenishing dated inventory on hand, for example, to your biggest retailers?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nYes, Michael, I'll start on that one. Just to add a little bit of dimension in terms of China, we've had strong growth across a number of the dimensions in that market. Our same-store sales growth is strong and remains strong. I wouldn't necessarily call it as decelerating significantly or call it decelerating significantly, I think as you noted. In terms of the prospects going forward, one of the things we touched on in our Investor Day was how much of our retail footprint we have impacted with our new category-oriented strategies in the wholesale marketplace. And if you'll recall, the number we gave at the time was that we've touched about 20% of that market in terms of our re-profiled doors and our more consumer-focused, category-oriented experiences. Those experiences continue to have very healthy inventory, much faster turns than we experienced years ago, strong comps, margin expansion. And again, that's 20% of the market. We still believe we have a significant opportunity in that market to continue to proliferate that across wholesale. And then again, one of the other things fueling our growth in China is our DTC business and notably, NIKE.com as Trevor referenced.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Binetti (Analysts)】\nGot it. And that's an interesting segue. When we think about the digital business going to $7 billion in revenues by 2020, would you mind talking to us about which categories or geographies the majority of that growth comes from? And how the mix of digital will look at that time compared to today which is very North America-weighted for you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, the digital business obviously provides a tremendous opportunity for us. And I think as we often talk about, it really touches all dimensions of the company. As you look at the growth rate, the growth rates we're seeing really will come from all the different dimensions of the business. When you think about the undeserved categories as certainly, as we look at the Women's business, we look at the Young Athletes business, we look at the Jordan business, all of those really provide great opportunity to growth from a category perspective, along with the big categories that are already growing. I'd also say the same time that I think from a geographic perspective, while North America is currently one of the larger growing ones, China has a tremendous, tremendous growth opportunity. We can see that as being one of the most connected markets out there. Europe has continued growth opportunities. So we really do see as an expansive opportunity across the board. And obviously then, there is Central and Eastern Europe which we've continued to see growth. So it really is one of those cases where it's a global footprint and we just see more and more opportunity, the deeper we dive.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Svezia (Analysts)】\nI guess, Andy, for you, I guess any color by any chance between on the futures number, front half, back half in terms of growth rates, any difference between the cadence?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Campion (Executives)】\nYes. The futures are slightly more heavily weighted towards the back half. I would refer you back to some of my remarks in our guidance, though. There are a number of factors that are worth taking into account in terms of futures and especially as they relate to revenue. That being the weighting of futures across the season as compared to just across this monthly reporting window as well as shipping timing and other factors. But in short, in terms of just the weighting kind of first half or second half of the year futures reporting window, slightly more heavily weighted towards the second half.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Svezia (Analysts)】\nI guess my second question pertains to the revenue outlook. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you said high single to low double-digit reported for Q3 but sustaining kind of a mid-single-digit growth on the year which is similar revenue growth that you gave on the last quarter despite the acceleration of futures, so which would imply I guess, a de-acceleration in revenue growth for Q4. Maybe walk us through so maybe why that will be the case or is it just being conservative, given the macro volatility? I'm just sort of curious for your thoughts about that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Campion (Executives)】\nYes. At first, what I would say is our full year guidance on revenue is consistent. So very much consistent with our guidance 90 days ago or in other words, unchanged. As we look at it, the balance of the year and you're looking to futures as a proxy, again, a number of factors and I touched on a few of those. There's also the timing of flowing product into the market around events and other factors, the timing of revenue recognition as you ship to wholesale customers as compared to shipping directly to consumers through our DTC business. So I refer you back to our guidance but the punchline on our guidance is that it remains consistent in terms of our full year revenue expectations.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nAll right. Well, thank you, everyone. Have a great holiday season. Happy new year, and we'll talk to you in Q3.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Holly, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.\r\nOn the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.\r\nAs a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports on our 10-Q and 10-K and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks.\r\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I'll then review guidance for Q3 and Q4 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.\r\nAs you can imagine, we are very pleased with the quarter. Total revenue exceeded my guidance, driven by the combined strength of our cloud business as well as better-than-expected results from the on-premise software business. Earnings per share were also above my guidance, coming in $0.04 better than the midpoint of the constant currency range I provided last quarter.\r\nQ2 currency headwinds were mostly as expected around 6% in most categories, including total revenues. However, the currency effect to earnings per share was $0.06, $0.01 more than my guidance.\r\nWe will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly call so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarter as well as to reflect how we measure the business.\r\nConsidering the progress we've made in our transition to the cloud and the subscription business, from now on, I'm going to start with our SaaS and PaaS business.\r\nWe continue to see excellent momentum there with bookings growth of 75% for this quarter on top of the 147% we reported last year. SaaS and PaaS revenue was $487 million, up 38% from last year, 39% in GAAP. Sequentially, SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 8% and we expect the sequential growth next quarter will be even higher.\r\nThe bookings growth that we have been experiencing will now translate into a significant acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue growth in Q3 where we could hit 50% revenue growth and in Q4, where it should be even higher.\r\nYou can also see the coming revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS Billings in deferred revenue. SaaS and PaaS Billings grew 68% in U.S. dollars this quarter, on top of the 70% growth last quarter. Also, the gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.1 billion and was up 135% in U.S. dollars. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.\r\nThe balance of our cloud revenues come from cloud Infrastructure as a Service, which was up 11% to $165 million. While SaaS and PaaS revenue will see much higher growth rates, we expect Infrastructure as a Service revenue growth, which is currently dominated by our hosting business, will be more moderate for now.\r\nTotal cloud revenues, which is SaaS, PaaS and IaaS were us $652 million, up 30%.\r\nAs our cloud revenue continues -- as our cloud revenue business continues to scale from the growth we are experiencing, it is beginning to benefit our margins as I previously predicted. The Q2 growth margin for SaaS and PaaS was 43%, up from 40% last quarter and will see further improvement in Q3. I also expect the Q4 exit rate gross margin for SaaS and PaaS will be around 55% to 60% and from there, we'll be targeting 80% in fiscal year '18. The gross margin in the IaaS business was up slightly to 45%.\r\nCapital expenditures for the quarter were $195 million or $251 million lower than Q1. And I expect the cloud-based, cloud-related CapEx for the full year will be lower than last year as we utilize the investments we have made.\r\nOn-premise software revenue, including new software license and software license updates and product support, was unchanged at $6.4 billion. Software license updates and product support revenue was $4.7 billion, up 5% from last year and up 1% sequentially \r\nAttach and renewal rates are running at their usual high level. New software license revenue was $1.7 billion, down from last year but a bit better than I expected for the quarter. \r\nOver the full year, I expect we will see modest growth in our on-premise software revenue, comprised of continued growth in software support that more than offsets declines in new software license.\r\nFinally, total hardware revenue was down 10%, which included hardware products revenue of $573 million and hardware support revenue of $550 million. Total revenue for the quarter was unchanged at $9 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.7 billion, and operating margin was 41%.\r\nI believe that for the fiscal year we are currently in, we are more than halfway through what will turn out to have been the trough year for operating income.\r\nThe non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% and the GAAP tax rate was 17.6% as we saw some onetime noncash benefit. Non-GAAP EPS was USD 0.63 and GAAP EPS was USD 0.51. As I said earlier, non-GAAP EPS was $0.06 lower due to currency.\r\nFree cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $11.3 billion. We now have more than $52 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is over $10.4 billion. Short-term deferred revenue balance is $7 billion, up 9% in constant currency.\r\nThis quarter, we repurchased more than 86 million shares for a total of $3.25 billion and over the last 4 years, we have reduced the share outstanding by more than 16%. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased more than 250 million shares for a total of $10.3 billion and paid out dividends of $2.5 billion for a total that is more than 110% of our free cash flow.\r\nI'd also like to formally welcome Renee James to Oracle's board. She's a great addition.\r\nNow to the guidance. I'm going to give you guidance for Q3 and then some preliminary guidance for Q4. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition and clearly, customers are rapidly adopting Oracle. As you know, we are expecting to see a material second half acceleration in our SaaS and PaaS revenue based on our bookings growth and the expiration of customer promotion. My guidance will reflect this, making it easier to see that we are taking share in the industry.\r\nSince we have a clear trend and visibility through the end of the fiscal year, I'm going to give not only Q3 guidance but also some guidance for Q4. My intention is to share with you what we are seeing in our business now that we have line of sight to it. All my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. We expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates. I'm going to give you constant currency guidance but if current exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see currency headwind of 4% on revenue and $0.03 to EPS, which is significantly less than Q2. \r\nSo on the guidance. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 49% and 53%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow between 3% to 7%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow 3% to 4%.\r\nTotal revenue growth is expected to range from 0% to positive 3%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.63 and $0.66. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may be -- it may end up being different, probably better.\r\nLooking further out to Q4, we expect to see continued acceleration in SaaS and PaaS as well as a return to EPS growth year-over-year.\r\nMy guidance for Q4 is also in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 59 -- 55% and 59%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow 1% to 5%.\r\nTotal cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 2% and 4%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 1% to 3%.\r\nNon-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.83 and $0.86, which is a significant increase compared to last year's $0.78.\r\nAs I've said before, I believe fiscal year 2016 is a trough year for profitability as we move to the cloud. As such, I expect to see strong EPS growth in Q1 and beyond.\r\nMy Q4 EPS guidance assumes the same non-GAAP tax rate as Q3 at 25.5%, but that's probably too early to get a real beat on.\r\nFinally, SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to improve in both Q3 and Q4, exiting the year between 55% and 60%. I will, of course, revisit Q4 guidance with you as part of the Q3 earnings call.\r\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments.\n\n---\n\nThanks so much, Safra. So in the spirit of giving you just a blizzard of numbers, I am going to extend that because our strong cloud bookings and deferred revenue growth will lead to revenue acceleration in the second half and next year.\r\nWe'd talked about a 38% year-on-year double-digit growth. Our billings grew 68%. And again, just to give you numbers, Salesforce grew 21% and Workday, 41%. We grew 68%. Bookings USD 284; in cloud, 75% growth.\r\nLet me give you some customer numbers. We added 857 new SaaS customers in the quarter. 720 customer expansions. Our installed base is now over 10,000 customers. Over 3,000 of these are Fusion. And almost 50% of our bookings in dollars are net Fusion.\r\nIn HCM, we added 211 customers, growing faster than Workday. CX, 409 customers. In ERP, we added 311 customers. We're now over 1,500 customers in our installed base. 450 are now live. 5x Workdays, 90. \r\nERP and EPM, more than half of our Q2 wins did not have Oracle on-premise apps, meaning that at 1 quarter we sold more net new customers than Workday did in its lifetime.\r\nIn PaaS, we added 1,343 new PaaS customers. 4,100 now over the last 12 months. Bookings, USD 100 million, and 75% of what we sold is now subscription, non-meter; 25%, meter. Our PaaS business is scaling nicely.\r\nNow I am going to read you a bunch of names. I just want you to get a context for sort of the brands we closed in the quarter. In ERP, Blue Shield of California; DHL, FDIC; McKesson; Toshiba Mitsubishi Electric, Wipro; a very large phone company in France; a very large industrial manufacturing company, perhaps the largest in the world with over $130 billion of revenue.\r\nIn HCM, AAA, Allergan, City of Aspen, Crocs. Think of many of these now that I'm naming, again, beats against Workday, Exelon; Kaiser; McGraw-Hill; Genesis; actually a replacement of Workday, Brocade. More HCM, the United Nations, Stanford University. \r\nIn CX, Ambev -- CXP and Customer Experience, Ambev, Expedia, Halliburton, Lufthansa, Maersk, Motorola solutions, Sears, Toshiba Mitsubishi; and United Airlines.\r\nIn PaaS, Anthem, IKEA, Kaiser, Kia Motors, Maersk, Qantas, Symantec and Windstream.\r\nI could have named a lot more. I just wanted to give you a flavor what we did in the quarter.\r\nJust to wrap up and connect a few dots for you in the Oracle SaaS, PaaS cloud. We are currently at a $2.6 billion run rate in total cloud revenue. It's likely our quarterly run rate will exit the year around $3.2 billion, and we'll grow further after Q1 bookings. We will book roughly 11 -- 1.5 -- more than $1.5 million in ARR this fiscal year -- billion, sorry, thank you, billion. If we continue to book the way we expect, we should see our first $1 billion quarter for SaaS, PaaS revenue next year.\r\nGross deferred revenue is now nearly $1.1 billion, that is up 135% year-on-year, 9% quarter-on-quarter. Gross margin improved sequentially, as Safra described, 40% to 43%. We're headed to 60%, and then as Safra described on to 80%.\r\nBut I'll now turn it over to Larry.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mark. I don't have nearly as many numbers. I'm moving right up to 25,000 feet and talk a little bit about strategy.\r\nOracle's strategy is to differentiate our cloud products from our competitors. In SaaS, we differentiate by delivering the industry's most complete suite of cloud applications. In Customer Experience, we offer a CX suite made up of sales, service, marketing, e-commerce and a lot more. And in Human Capital Management, we have an HCM suite made up of human resources, recruiting, training, and so on.\r\nIn Enterprise Resource Planning. We are delivering an ERP suite made up of financials, supply chain, manufacturing and all the rest.\r\nOracle is the first company to market a complete cloud ERP suite from midsize and large enterprises. By pioneering this market, we have become the ERP market leader with over 1,500 cloud ERP customers. Cloud ERP is now our fastest-growing SaaS application suite.\r\nIn PaaS, we have differentiated by making it effortless for our hundreds of thousands of customers to move their millions of existing Oracle databases and Java programs to our cloud with a push of a button, thereby obtaining the low cost and ease-of-use of the cloud without having to sacrifice any performance loss or any security degradation.\r\nWe now have a highly differentiated, rapidly growing SaaS and PaaS businesses. This coming year, we will deliver a number of innovations in Infrastructure as a Service as well.\r\nWe expect that our rapidly growing cloud business will drive Oracle's overall revenue and overall profit growth for years and years to come.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Larry. Holly, can we please move to the Q&A portion of the call?",

Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow 3% to 4%.\r\nTotal revenue growth is expected to range from 0% to positive 3%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.63 and $0.66. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may be -- it may end up being different, probably better.\r\nLooking further out to Q4, we expect to see continued acceleration in SaaS and PaaS as well as a return to EPS growth year-over-year.\r\nMy guidance for Q4 is also in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 59 -- 55% and 59%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow 1% to 5%.\r\nTotal cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 2% and 4%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 1% to 3%.\r\nNon-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.83 and $0.86, which is a significant increase compared to last year's $0.78.\r\nAs I've said before, I believe fiscal year 2016 is a trough year for profitability as we move to the cloud. As such, I expect to see strong EPS growth in Q1 and beyond.\r\nMy Q4 EPS guidance assumes the same non-GAAP tax rate as Q3 at 25.5%, but that's probably too early to get a real beat on.\r\nFinally, SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to improve in both Q3 and Q4, exiting the year between 55% and 60%. I will, of course, revisit Q4 guidance with you as part of the Q3 earnings call.\r\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nThanks so much, Safra. So in the spirit of giving you just a blizzard of numbers, I am going to extend that because our strong cloud bookings and deferred revenue growth will lead to revenue acceleration in the second half and next year.\r\nWe'd talked about a 38% year-on-year double-digit growth. Our billings grew 68%. And again, just to give you numbers, Salesforce grew 21% and Workday, 41%. We grew 68%. Bookings USD 284; in cloud, 75% growth.\r\nLet me give you some customer numbers. We added 857 new SaaS customers in the quarter. 720 customer expansions. Our installed base is now over 10,000 customers. Over 3,000 of these are Fusion. And almost 50% of our bookings in dollars are net Fusion.\r\nIn HCM, we added 211 customers, growing faster than Workday. CX, 409 customers. In ERP, we added 311 customers. We're now over 1,500 customers in our installed base. 450 are now live. 5x Workdays, 90. \r\nERP and EPM, more than half of our Q2 wins did not have Oracle on-premise apps, meaning that at 1 quarter we sold more net new customers than Workday did in its lifetime.\r\nIn PaaS, we added 1,343 new PaaS customers. 4,100 now over the last 12 months. Bookings, USD 100 million, and 75% of what we sold is now subscription, non-meter; 25%, meter. Our PaaS business is scaling nicely.\r\nNow I am going to read you a bunch of names. I just want you to get a context for sort of the brands we closed in the quarter. In ERP, Blue Shield of California; DHL, FDIC; McKesson; Toshiba Mitsubishi Electric, Wipro; a very large phone company in France; a very large industrial manufacturing company, perhaps the largest in the world with over $130 billion of revenue.\r\nIn HCM, AAA, Allergan, City of Aspen, Crocs. Think of many of these now that I'm naming, again, beats against Workday, Exelon; Kaiser; McGraw-Hill; Genesis; actually a replacement of Workday, Brocade. More HCM, the United Nations, Stanford University. \r\nIn CX, Ambev -- CXP and Customer Experience, Ambev, Expedia, Halliburton, Lufthansa, Maersk, Motorola solutions, Sears, Toshiba Mitsubishi; and United Airlines.\r\nIn PaaS, Anthem, IKEA, Kaiser, Kia Motors, Maersk, Qantas, Symantec and Windstream.\r\nI could have named a lot more. I just wanted to give you a flavor what we did in the quarter.\r\nJust to wrap up and connect a few dots for you in the Oracle SaaS, PaaS cloud. We are currently at a $2.6 billion run rate in total cloud revenue. It's likely our quarterly run rate will exit the year around $3.2 billion, and we'll grow further after Q1 bookings. We will book roughly 11 -- 1.5 -- more than $1.5 million in ARR this fiscal year -- billion, sorry, thank you, billion. If we continue to book the way we expect, we should see our first $1 billion quarter for SaaS, PaaS revenue next year.\r\nGross deferred revenue is now nearly $1.1 billion, that is up 135% year-on-year, 9% quarter-on-quarter. Gross margin improved sequentially, as Safra described, 40% to 43%. We're headed to 60%, and then as Safra described on to 80%.\r\nBut I'll now turn it over to Larry.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nThanks, Mark. I don't have nearly as many numbers. I'm moving right up to 25,000 feet and talk a little bit about strategy.\r\nOracle's strategy is to differentiate our cloud products from our competitors. In SaaS, we differentiate by delivering the industry's most complete suite of cloud applications. In Customer Experience, we offer a CX suite made up of sales, service, marketing, e-commerce and a lot more. And in Human Capital Management, we have an HCM suite made up of human resources, recruiting, training, and so on.\r\nIn Enterprise Resource Planning. We are delivering an ERP suite made up of financials, supply chain, manufacturing and all the rest.\r\nOracle is the first company to market a complete cloud ERP suite from midsize and large enterprises. By pioneering this market, we have become the ERP market leader with over 1,500 cloud ERP customers. Cloud ERP is now our fastest-growing SaaS application suite.\r\nIn PaaS, we have differentiated by making it effortless for our hundreds of thousands of customers to move their millions of existing Oracle databases and Java programs to our cloud with a push of a button, thereby obtaining the low cost and ease-of-use of the cloud without having to sacrifice any performance loss or any security degradation.\r\nWe now have a highly differentiated, rapidly growing SaaS and PaaS businesses. This coming year, we will deliver a number of innovations in Infrastructure as a Service as well.\r\nWe expect that our rapidly growing cloud business will drive Oracle's overall revenue and overall profit growth for years and years to come.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Ken Bond (Executives)】\nThank you, Larry. Holly, can we please move to the Q&A portion of the call?",
      "transcript_text3": "Safra, I had a question for you. Just based on yours and Mark's comments about the $1.5 billion plus in SaaS, PaaS bookings this fiscal year, is it reasonable then to assume that in fiscal '17, we should see SaaS, PaaS revenue growth accelerate versus what you're guiding to for fiscal '16?\n\n---\n\nYes, Heather, in fact, it will accelerate very strongly. It can't help itself. Our bookings are so strong. We've had so many contracts already. And we'll be recognizing those basically regardless of how bookings go. And, of course, as you can see, our bookings are also accelerating. So -- but yes, we're going to have a phenomenal FY '17 in the closet.\n\n---\n\nYes, you know Heather right from the start it's going to be strong because you're going to wind up with a Q4 at the revenue rate that we just gave you some guidance on. You have the booking on top of it. And when you start Q1, and into 2Q, you can already do the math on what the comparisons are going to look like. So it's going to be a strong year and particularly strong start.\n\n---\n\nSafra, it's nice to see some modest progress in your gross margin goals for the cloud business, 43% versus 40% last quarter, but non-GAAP operating margin at 41% was a little bit below what we're looking for anyway. I guess, can you expand a little bit on the gross margin progress into the end of the year? I mean, this is going to be a steep ramp in -- I'm just trying to figure out how much of this is just based simply on this sort of top line growth you're going to see as the sales promotions sort of end and you start to see the top line growth that's going to happen. Or how much of it, if there's any, just due to increased efficiencies as you move along. And then, on the operating margin side, I realize you don't hedge the income statement, but was this due -- like, could it -- like, what would have been the impact on excluding foreign exchange effects?\n\n---\n\nSo -- okay, so let's back up. It is all -- the bulk of the SaaS and PaaS margin improvement is because we are now recognizing revenues for which -- and much, much larger revenues, for which we have already paid for many of the costs. And so we've built up an infrastructure that can handle massive amount of usage, significantly more usage and we have not been able to recognize the revenue because we're recognizing it ratably. As we scale, this is absolutely in the area where it is inevitable that we -- that this improves. In addition, we also have efficiency gains at all times but that is again because of our larger scale and those are simply economies of scale. But the bulk of it is we are starting to be able to recognize revenues for which we have already invested. As how many points -- I actually -- the impact on operating income for us was quite significant from a currency point of view, but -- hold on I'm doing the math, Q3. I don't know, I've got to actually do it on our margins? I'll have to do it while you're talking -- while other people are talking and then I'll give you the exact answer at that point, how much of it was the --\n\n---\n\nJohn, we'll circle back later in the call here. Why don't we go to the next question, please?\n\n---\n\nMark, I think by my math, the cloud bookings are about $475 million year-to-date, and so to hit the $1.5 billion for the year, $1.5 billion, you need to deliver $1 billion-ish or so in the second half. Just how confident are you in that goal? And then, related to that, I'm curious on the platform or Database as a Service, you commented that non-metered was a higher percentage. I was just curious to get a sense of how you see customer usage trending on the Database as a Service product?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, let me tell you, confident, that would be my answer to your question. Our pipeline, I think, I mentioned this at Financial Analyst Day, as I'm going to mention it again. Our pipeline -- I can't come up with a better analytical statement than just huge. And so our pipeline now is multiple billions of dollars. Let me give you more color. If I look at the next 6 months, our pipeline of things that are in the next 6 months funnel, you have a multibillion-dollar funnel and our conversion rate is increasing. So that would tell you -- and our business has become scaled enough Ross, just to be clear, that it now is behaving like a large business begins to in terms of the scale of the funnel, the pipeline, the discipline we have, the conversion rates we have, et cetera. So that would be sort of my view on that. On PaaS, we have had a change to your point of going away from metered to subscription bookings. So the bookings are now the bulk, as I mentioned, the 75% now subscription as opposed to metered. And I would say the usage of our PaaS has increased not significantly but sort of geometrically, meaning that it's gone from when we originally started the usage to jump up over the last 4 or 6 months, I'd say, to where the usage is extremely high, extremely high in terms of the increase of our usage. So it's very exciting both on the bookings, the type of bookings and the usage that we're seeing of what's booked.\n\n---\n\nMark, you gave some pretty impressive metrics just on the customer count side, obviously, in addition to the numbers Safra talked about in terms of just cloud billings. But if I focus on the SaaS side in particular here, really, just a competitive question here. Obviously, you've put up some numbers that are sort of multiple times the size of your competitors. When you kind of look application by application, because not obviously every segment's the same, where do you think you're kind of pulling away from the competition? Where have you seen sort of the biggest change, you think, in that position over the past, call it, 1, 2 years, that will be great.\n\n---\n\nWell, I'd start -- again, I'm going to make this -- this is going to be like the fifth time I've said this, but I'm going to try it again. That in SaaS overall, we are just better overall. We have more people, we're well-trained, our products all have matured, and we have a lot of references. Our position in ERP is just unique. We don't have a competitor per se. I used these metrics to -- against Workday just to describe to you how exponentially far ahead of our sort of only person I can think of that's built a product. Just to be clear in ERP SaaS, I don't ever -- I'm not trying -- Safra might have somebody she knows or Larry might know somebody, I don't see SAP. I'm out in the market a lot. I don't see them. So I don't know what they're working on but it's not ERP SaaS. In HCM, I think we are continue to just get better and better and better. I mentioned because I had a blizzard of names that I may have done myself a dis-service by mentioning so many names. But in a couple of days, we actually, replaced Workday. So imagine in a period of time, Workday -- sorry, in HCM, we replaced Workday. So we continue to get better and better and better at HCM, and now we're beginning to see a lot of deals that are where you sell ERP and HCM is attached to the ERP sale. So because of ERP being a, in many ways, a very strategic, very sticky sale, we now see our attach rates moving up and up and up where somebody buys ERP and they buy HCM at the same time. The scale of our Fusion products, well, the reason I gave you that metric for the first time is it's now a very high -- it's now beginning to become a reasonable percent of our total portfolio versus everything that we've got, including marketing, which is having a great run, as you know. But I add to it the fact that now Fusion products, which are extremely sticky are almost 50% of our total bookings. So I mean, I could -- feel I could keep going down these metrics for you, but I think we're unique in ERP and getting farther ahead. I mean, we're in the point now we're over 1,500 customers. We'll give you a prognostication where we end the year but I -- it's going to be well over 2,000. I guess, I just did. It's going be well over 2,000. We're getting better and better at HCM, we're in a leadership position in marketing. I feel good about where we sit.\n\n---\n\nWe talked a lot about cloud but can I talk -- ask about database business. So 12c is in beta since Open World, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing -- we're coming closer to release 2 now, hopefully, what are you seeing out in the market?\n\n---\n\nWell, we see our customers with a much higher uptake of 12.2 simply because they have 2 key features that are very important to our customers. One is the in-memory aspect of the database, where we now have the fastest in-memory database. And the way you take advantage of that, you take any existing Oracle application and you run it without change on 12 -- 12.2 and it runs much, much -- it runs in-memory without changing. So other people say, we'll use my in-memory database, we have to rewrite the application. In this case, you don't have to rewrite the application. You press the button. We run much faster. And by the way, we run faster than the competition. So we have a lot of our customers want to take advantage of in-memory acceleration, that's one of the reasons they buy the new version of the database. The other thing is multi-tenancy. They like to do a lot of consolidation. They have a lot of small databases. They like to run on one machine. And you can do that much more efficiently by running the Oracle database with multiple tenants. You consume less hardware resources, it's easier to manage, you can back up a whole suite of databases, a group of databases as one. It's thoroughly automated. So that's the other major reason we see a very rapid uptake. And finally, we're seeing our customers, as our PaaS business begins to increase in adoption, that the customer wants to run the latest version of the database in the cloud and they want to match that up with the latest version of the database in their data center. They want to run this basically the same technology both in our cloud and their data center, and that's one of the unique value propositions that we offer our cloud customers. The same exact technology on-premise and in the cloud. And those things will then coexist for years and years to come. Then the customers are syncing up their versions. We have the latest version in the cloud, they want the latest version on-premise. That's also accelerating the adoption of the database on-premise.\n\n---\n\nAs I look at the results geographically, Asia and Europe look to be pretty solid, especially given what's going on in Asia. North America seems to lag a bit. Were there any specific items that led to that underperformance?\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nNo, you're also looking at the Americas. So for example, hardware revenue is particularly problematic for us in Latin America, things like that. So you look at the Americas, you're actually seeing Latin America, which has issues of course with Brazil; and North America, Canada, altogether.\n\n---\n\nYes, U.S. was fine. I think to your point, Asia was strong. We've been doing -- our team has talked about this before, we've been doing a lot of rebuilding in Asia and that has really shown promise for us and the results reflect that in the quarter. Europe had a solid quarter overall. We had excellent results in the cloud, and U.S. was fine, would be the way we describe it. In the Americas, to Safra's point, you have the inclusion of Latin America, which is a great organization, they've done a great job, they're gaining share. In fact, if I look at every sort of metric we have in Latin America, we've gained share in virtually every category we compete in Latin America. But within the context of the quarter, the situation in Brazil is tough, which is reflected in the overall Americas result that you're describing.\n\n---\n\nMark, I just want to double-click on the strength in Fusion ERP, I guess, if we could. Just given how far in front you seem to be in that area, are there any specific verticals or geographies that are sort of outsized in terms of how you guys are doing? And I was also curious about how much of the strength is sort of you guys going into the mid-market in a bigger way or the mid to upper mid-market in a bigger way? Or are you actually starting to see some broader G2000 deals as well in terms of ERP product?\n\n---\n\nWell, my inclination to answer your question, yes. But let me try to describe sort of what's happening. We talked a bit this a little bit at Financial Analyst Day. The good news about ERP -- our ERP suite is it's still not available. It's just going into other geographies. So with the last release we had, we've now brought on manufacturing and supply chain. We're now releasing the product for sale in some -- like for example, in Brazil, and some European countries. So we actually get some geographic expansion with the last release we had. So this is actually good news. The strong, in this case, actually get stronger. We actually, now have a material number of references. I think I mentioned but I'm going to try again, we have over now 450 customers-wide. This is a big, big metric. Our market also expands in a couple ways with ERP, which makes it so important. We get 2 increases on our total available market. One is what you mentioned, the fact that we actually get to go downmarket now. And yes, we do have broad market expansion. We get to compete for companies that otherwise would never have had an IT staff, couldn't have had assembled an ERP system, we now get to compete. We also now, remember when we win an ERP system, we win the hardware, we win everything, we win the whole stack. So our TAM really goes up on 2 -- our total available market on 2 dimensions, the total stack in addition to our ability to compete downmarket. Now that broad base, that's why I specifically used the names I did. Our success is not unique to mid-market or upmarket. It's really both. I mentioned the name of the biggest -- I didn't mention the name, very, very big telephone company in France, very big industrial company. These are huge companies. At the same time, is we have $50 million companies that are moving to our cloud ERP. So it is broad-based success across geographies but the good news I have for you, I think we're just really getting started.\n\n---\n\nLarry, at Analyst Day, you talked about building second-generation data center architecture that should improve Oracle's overall competitive positioning. Can you give us a little more color on what changes you're making and when this will be rolled out?\n\n---\n\nWell, again, I said in my short remarks before we started the Q&A, I said we will be delivering innovations in Infrastructure as a Service and we have a next-generation data center that we've been architecting and building and, in fact, we've actually put out -- the data center is actually kind of up and running. They're actually 3 data centers, we'll be calling availability zone, they're all connected by a fiber optic ring. And the thing we've really -- we focus on a number of things. Obviously, availability, performance, security, are all things you'd expect us to focus on. The big surprise -- the big surprise is we think we will be, by far, the lowest cost provider of Infrastructure as a Service. We think we -- we've been in this business a very long time. We're very focused. This is our data -- this is data center version 2. We've been doing this for a while now. And we think that our cost of delivering Infrastructure as a Service in the cloud are much, much, much lower than anyone else's cost with this new architecture and with these new data centers. We'll be passing that on to our customers.\n\n---\n\nOkay. You know what, I just needed to answer -- I think DiFucci's question, which I think it's about from here about 3.5 to 4 points, something like that, okay?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Safra. A telephone replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call, and we look forward to speaking with you.\r\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for closing.",

So I mean, I could -- feel I could keep going down these metrics for you, but I think we're unique in ERP and getting farther ahead. I mean, we're in the point now we're over 1,500 customers. We'll give you a prognostication where we end the year but I -- it's going to be well over 2,000. I guess, I just did. It's going be well over 2,000. We're getting better and better at HCM, we're in a leadership position in marketing. I feel good about where we sit.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Raimo Lenschow (Analysts)】\nWe talked a lot about cloud but can I talk -- ask about database business. So 12c is in beta since Open World, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing -- we're coming closer to release 2 now, hopefully, what are you seeing out in the market?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nWell, we see our customers with a much higher uptake of 12.2 simply because they have 2 key features that are very important to our customers. One is the in-memory aspect of the database, where we now have the fastest in-memory database. And the way you take advantage of that, you take any existing Oracle application and you run it without change on 12 -- 12.2 and it runs much, much -- it runs in-memory without changing. So other people say, we'll use my in-memory database, we have to rewrite the application. In this case, you don't have to rewrite the application. You press the button. We run much faster. And by the way, we run faster than the competition. So we have a lot of our customers want to take advantage of in-memory acceleration, that's one of the reasons they buy the new version of the database. The other thing is multi-tenancy. They like to do a lot of consolidation. They have a lot of small databases. They like to run on one machine. And you can do that much more efficiently by running the Oracle database with multiple tenants. You consume less hardware resources, it's easier to manage, you can back up a whole suite of databases, a group of databases as one. It's thoroughly automated. So that's the other major reason we see a very rapid uptake. And finally, we're seeing our customers, as our PaaS business begins to increase in adoption, that the customer wants to run the latest version of the database in the cloud and they want to match that up with the latest version of the database in their data center. They want to run this basically the same technology both in our cloud and their data center, and that's one of the unique value propositions that we offer our cloud customers. The same exact technology on-premise and in the cloud. And those things will then coexist for years and years to come. Then the customers are syncing up their versions. We have the latest version in the cloud, they want the latest version on-premise. That's also accelerating the adoption of the database on-premise.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brad Reback (Analysts)】\nAs I look at the results geographically, Asia and Europe look to be pretty solid, especially given what's going on in Asia. North America seems to lag a bit. Were there any specific items that led to that underperformance?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nNo, you're also looking at the Americas. So for example, hardware revenue is particularly problematic for us in Latin America, things like that. So you look at the Americas, you're actually seeing Latin America, which has issues of course with Brazil; and North America, Canada, altogether.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nYes, U.S. was fine. I think to your point, Asia was strong. We've been doing -- our team has talked about this before, we've been doing a lot of rebuilding in Asia and that has really shown promise for us and the results reflect that in the quarter. Europe had a solid quarter overall. We had excellent results in the cloud, and U.S. was fine, would be the way we describe it. In the Americas, to Safra's point, you have the inclusion of Latin America, which is a great organization, they've done a great job, they're gaining share. In fact, if I look at every sort of metric we have in Latin America, we've gained share in virtually every category we compete in Latin America. But within the context of the quarter, the situation in Brazil is tough, which is reflected in the overall Americas result that you're describing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: S. Kirk Materne (Analysts)】\nMark, I just want to double-click on the strength in Fusion ERP, I guess, if we could. Just given how far in front you seem to be in that area, are there any specific verticals or geographies that are sort of outsized in terms of how you guys are doing? And I was also curious about how much of the strength is sort of you guys going into the mid-market in a bigger way or the mid to upper mid-market in a bigger way? Or are you actually starting to see some broader G2000 deals as well in terms of ERP product?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nWell, my inclination to answer your question, yes. But let me try to describe sort of what's happening. We talked a bit this a little bit at Financial Analyst Day. The good news about ERP -- our ERP suite is it's still not available. It's just going into other geographies. So with the last release we had, we've now brought on manufacturing and supply chain. We're now releasing the product for sale in some -- like for example, in Brazil, and some European countries. So we actually get some geographic expansion with the last release we had. So this is actually good news. The strong, in this case, actually get stronger. We actually, now have a material number of references. I think I mentioned but I'm going to try again, we have over now 450 customers-wide. This is a big, big metric. Our market also expands in a couple ways with ERP, which makes it so important. We get 2 increases on our total available market. One is what you mentioned, the fact that we actually get to go downmarket now. And yes, we do have broad market expansion. We get to compete for companies that otherwise would never have had an IT staff, couldn't have had assembled an ERP system, we now get to compete. We also now, remember when we win an ERP system, we win the hardware, we win everything, we win the whole stack. So our TAM really goes up on 2 -- our total available market on 2 dimensions, the total stack in addition to our ability to compete downmarket. Now that broad base, that's why I specifically used the names I did. Our success is not unique to mid-market or upmarket. It's really both. I mentioned the name of the biggest -- I didn't mention the name, very, very big telephone company in France, very big industrial company. These are huge companies. At the same time, is we have $50 million companies that are moving to our cloud ERP. So it is broad-based success across geographies but the good news I have for you, I think we're just really getting started.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joel Fishbein (Analysts)】\nLarry, at Analyst Day, you talked about building second-generation data center architecture that should improve Oracle's overall competitive positioning. Can you give us a little more color on what changes you're making and when this will be rolled out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nWell, again, I said in my short remarks before we started the Q&A, I said we will be delivering innovations in Infrastructure as a Service and we have a next-generation data center that we've been architecting and building and, in fact, we've actually put out -- the data center is actually kind of up and running. They're actually 3 data centers, we'll be calling availability zone, they're all connected by a fiber optic ring. And the thing we've really -- we focus on a number of things. Obviously, availability, performance, security, are all things you'd expect us to focus on. The big surprise -- the big surprise is we think we will be, by far, the lowest cost provider of Infrastructure as a Service. We think we -- we've been in this business a very long time. We're very focused. This is our data -- this is data center version 2. We've been doing this for a while now. And we think that our cost of delivering Infrastructure as a Service in the cloud are much, much, much lower than anyone else's cost with this new architecture and with these new data centers. We'll be passing that on to our customers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nOkay. You know what, I just needed to answer -- I think DiFucci's question, which I think it's about from here about 3.5 to 4 points, something like that, okay?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ken Bond (Executives)】\nThank you, Safra. A telephone replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call, and we look forward to speaking with you.\r\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for closing.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings release call and webcast. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2015. Our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussions and analysis for the results of the quarter, will be available in the next few days. Our earnings release and 10-Q will be available on our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month.\r\nOn today's call, I will review highlights for the second quarter related to sales, operations and product development, Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance, and then we'll open it up for your questions or discussion.\r\nWe made good progress across all major product lines during the second quarter. Compared to second quarter of last year, payroll revenue advanced 4% as a result of growth in client base and revenue per check.  HRS revenue grew at double-digit rates in the second quarter once again, led by our success in selling HR outsourcing solutions to our clients. In total, service revenue grew 7%. We continue to experience solid results and momentum across our sales organization with double-digit growth in revenue sold compared to last year. Our team selling approach continues to produce results by introducing the full suite of products that Paychex can offer our clients upfront. We are encouraged by this momentum as we enter our main selling season right now.\r\nOur execution in service operations also continues to be excellent, as demonstrated by client satisfaction results and retention levels that remain consistent with recent highs. The employees in our service organization have done a great job as we move to more flexible service options with Paychex Flex, including 7/24 service. \r\nWe expanded our human capital management product suite again with the recent launch of our integrated Paychex Flex Time and Paychex Flex Benefits Administration modules. These are 2 of the newest modules for our cloud-based HCM platform.\r\nPaychex Flex Time is a market-leading time and attendance cloud-based solution. It provides real-time data access and is designed to be exceptionally easy and intuitive to use for our clients. It gives employers unprecedented visibility and control over labor scheduling, tracking and reporting.\r\nPaychex Flex Benefits Administration provides employers with a robust customizable system built to improve employee productivity, communication and decision-making, and allowing complete oversight and control of employee information effectively to manage a company's benefit plans. We also have best-in-market mobility offerings, in our opinion, for both administrative users and employee self-service that allow access to our HCM suite from a single mobile application.\r\nWe continue to receive positive reviews for our Flex platform that we're very proud of, as evidenced by our recognition from the Brandon Hall Group excellence awards for an advancement in workforce management technology for small and midsized businesses and PC Magazine's recent review referring to Paychex Flex as excellent and calling it more robust and scalable than many of the competitors' platforms they reviewed.\r\nTurning to the Affordable Care Act, last fiscal year, we launched our Paychex Employer Shared Responsibility Service to assist clients navigating the health care reform. Our ESR product includes monthly monitoring with automatic alerts, as well as year-end reporting, and we are pleased with the continued level of client acceptance that we have experienced. We have increased our implementation and support spending to address the increased demand that we've received for ESR. I appreciate the great hard work and dedication of this ESR team, helping our clients through this first year of complex ACA requirements.\r\nOur Paychex Insurance Agency was named to the Business Insurance magazine's list of best places to work in insurance for the very first time. This is a notable recognition and I'm very proud of the agency employees and the growth we've seen in the insurance business.\r\nOn December 2, we announced our planned acquisition of Advance Partners, based just outside of Cleveland, Ohio. We are enthusiastic about the opportunity Advance Partners presents and the experienced and successful leadership team that will be joining Paychex. They offer customizable solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding and outsourcing services that include payroll processing administration and invoicing. \r\nThe staffing outsourcing business is a growing industry. It serves many small and midsized staffing firms which is an ideal fit for us at Paychex.  Also, given Paychex's extensive product suite, financial strength and access to capital, we can help expand Advance Partners product offering and accelerate its growth. This acquisition will close shortly.\r\nWe remain committed to adding additional value for our shareholders. With our dividend at $0.42 per share, we maintain a strong dividend yield, one of the highest in the industry. The Paychex stock repurchase program remains in place and we have acquired over 1 million shares of common stock in the first 6 months of fiscal '16. And in summary, I am very pleased with the continued strong execution of our sales and service teams, our product strength and financial performance, and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee team.\r\nI will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning to you all. I'd like to remind everyone that during today's conference call, we'll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and thus involve risk. Refer to the usual disclosures. \r\nAs Marty indicated, second quarter financial results for fiscal 2016 represented a continuation of the solid start we had to the year. I'll cover the highlights and provide greater detail in certain areas, then wrap with a review of our 2016 outlook. I'll have some comments on second half guidance, so as I get midway through my comments, you'll start to hear those.\r\nTotal revenue grew 7% for the second quarter, 8% for the 6 months to $722 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. Total service revenue also grew 7% for the second quarter and 8% for the 6 months to $711 million and $1.4 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 8% for the second quarter and 7% for the 6 months to $11 million and $22 million, respectively. These changes were driven by higher average invest -- interest rates, I should say, and higher average investment balances.\r\nExpenses increased 5% for the second quarter and 6% for the 6 months, primarily in compensation-related cost and strong growth in the PEO. The increase in compensation-related costs was driven by higher wages and performance-based compensation costs.\r\nOperating income net of certain items increased 9% for the second quarter and 10% for the 6 months to $283 million and $568 million, respectively. We maintained strong operating margins of 40%, but anticipate that our full year will remain within our guidance of approximately 38%. The second half of the fiscal year, consistent with prior years, is expected to result in lower margins, primarily due to higher selling and operations costs, which are variable, and more detail on that later.\r\nNet income increased 9% to $189 million for the second quarter and 16% to $398 million for the 6 months. Diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $0.52 per share for the second quarter and 17% to $1.10 per share for the 6 months. The 6-month period was positively impacted by the net tax benefit related to prior-year revenues that was recognized in the first quarter. When we exclude this impact, net income and diluted earnings per share would have risen 10% and 12%, respectively.\r\nLet's turn to payroll revenue. Payroll service revenue increased 4% for both the second quarter and 6 months to $427 million and $860 million, respectively. We benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increase. Net of discounting, checks per client really didn't benefit payroll revenue.\r\nHRS revenue increased 11% to $284 million for the second quarter and 13% to $564 million for the 6 months. This increase reflects strong growth in both clients and worksite employees of Paychex HR Services, which includes our ASO and PEO products. Insurance services benefited from continued growth of our ESR product that assists clients with health care reform and an increase in health and benefits applications together -- applicants, together with higher average premiums and clients and in workers' comp insurance product.  Our HR administration and time and attendance products contributed to the growth through robust sales of these solutions. Retirement services revenue benefited from growth in the number of plans and an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participant funds. Retirement services revenue growth was offset by pricing impacts in the respective prior-year period.\r\nLet's look at investments and income. Our goal, as you know, is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, we -- primary short-term investment vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts, high-quality commercial paper and variable-rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high-credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and an average duration of approximately 3.3 years.  Our combined portfolios have earned an average return of 1.1% for both the second quarter and the 6 months. \r\nOn December 16, as you all are aware, the Fed raised federal funds rates by 25 basis points, the first interest rate hike in nearly a decade. We expect the impact for the balance of the fiscal year will be modest.\r\nLet's take a look at our financial position. It remains strong, with cash and total corporate investments of $913 million. Funds held for clients as of November 30, 2015 were $3.7 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis, and they averaged $3.7 billion for the quarter and $3.8 billion for the 6 months.\r\nOur total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $34 million as of November 30, compared with net unrealized gains of $14 million as of May.\r\nTotal stockholder's equity was $1.9 billion, reflecting $304 million in dividends paid during the 6 months and 63 million of common shares repurchased. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 39%.\r\nCash flows from operations were $420 million for the first 6 months, a 4% increase from the prior year. This change was the result of higher net income on cash flow from operations, offset by fluctuations in working capital. The fluctuations in our working capital between periods were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll and income taxes.\r\nNow, I'd like to turn to fiscal 2016 guidance. Let me remind you first that our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions and that guidance for the full year is unchanged from the previous quarter. I'll reiterate our full-year ranges and then give some color on the back half of the year.\r\nPayroll service revenue anticipated to remain in the range of 4% to 5%, HRS in the range of 10% to 13%, total service revenue in the range of 7% to 8%, and net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 9%. Please note that the range excludes the benefit of the net tax benefit we recorded in the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year, excluding the impact of the net tax benefit discussed above, will be approximately 36%. \r\nOur interest on funds held for clients and operating margin are expected to be consistent with prior guidance.\r\nNow, current guidance doesn't include the announcement by the Fed of a 25 basis point change in rates. This is going to equate to approximately $1 million after-tax for the remainder of this fiscal year. On the call, I'll talk a little bit about why it may be more modest than you assume, but I would just say to preface that conversation that much of that impact won't be start to be felt until January, and then it will be modest. Our guidance also does not include any expectation of future increases. We don't look at forward rates to determine what guidance should be. We simply make an assumption once the Fed is active. There, obviously, is a chance that the Fed will continue to raise. We'll update guidance when that happens.\r\nFull year guidance currently excludes the impact to the Advance Partners acquisition that Marty referenced earlier and which we expect to close shortly. It is not expected to impact earnings in the current fiscal year, meaning it will not be dilutive in this year, neither will it be accretive in the balance of the fiscal year. I'll describe separately the impact of Advance shortly.\r\nSo while it isn't our typical practice to provide specific guidance on quarters, we do want to be as transparent as possible and provide you with some color on third and fourth quarter this year. Payroll revenue growth for the third quarter is anticipated to be at the lower end of the guidance range, while payroll revenue growth in the fourth quarter, we anticipate to be at the higher end of the range. As we stated in previous calls, the fourth quarter will benefit from one additional processing day this year. This was the case in the first quarter, as you all remember.\r\nHRS revenue growth for the third quarter is anticipated to fall below the low end of the full year guidance range, as we indicated in previous calls. I called that out when we started the year. This is a result of strong third quarter in the prior year, resulting from very strong PEO performance, and we had benefited from pricing in our retirement services businesses. While both are doing fine, they just simply don't -- are not as strong as they were in the prior year. For the fourth quarter, we expect HRS revenue growth will be within the full year range.\r\nIn addition, we anticipate, as is typically the case, higher selling expenses in the second half of the year. But this year, given the strength of our sales performance in the first 6 months of the year, we believe that selling expense will be higher than we had planned. We also anticipate higher operations expense due to stronger sales, that I just mentioned, and also very, very strong demand for our ACA compliance solution. So you'll feel much of that in the third quarter.\r\nAgain, current year guidance is not changed. So as I just mentioned, the guidance that I discussed doesn't include any impact from Advance Partners. So when we close, this is what the anticipate. For the balance of the year, we believe that the acquisition will contribute approximately 1% to payroll revenue growth and approximately 1.5% to HRS revenue growth. That's in the balance of the year, the second half. That impact will be -- primarily, will be split more towards the fourth quarter than the third quarter, because we anticipate that we'll only recognize 2 months of revenue in Q3. So the weighting will be a little bit more towards the fourth quarter. And we anticipate that additional expenses, operating expenses from the acquisition, will offset revenue in the balance of this year. It won't be dilutive, it won't be accretive, it will essentially be neutral.\r\nSo I hope that was clear. And with that, I'm going to turn it back to Marty for questions.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Efrain. At this point, we will now open the call to your questions or comments. Operator?",

And in summary, I am very pleased with the continued strong execution of our sales and service teams, our product strength and financial performance, and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee team.\r\nI will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThanks, Marty, and good morning to you all. I'd like to remind everyone that during today's conference call, we'll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and thus involve risk. Refer to the usual disclosures. \r\nAs Marty indicated, second quarter financial results for fiscal 2016 represented a continuation of the solid start we had to the year. I'll cover the highlights and provide greater detail in certain areas, then wrap with a review of our 2016 outlook. I'll have some comments on second half guidance, so as I get midway through my comments, you'll start to hear those.\r\nTotal revenue grew 7% for the second quarter, 8% for the 6 months to $722 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. Total service revenue also grew 7% for the second quarter and 8% for the 6 months to $711 million and $1.4 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 8% for the second quarter and 7% for the 6 months to $11 million and $22 million, respectively. These changes were driven by higher average invest -- interest rates, I should say, and higher average investment balances.\r\nExpenses increased 5% for the second quarter and 6% for the 6 months, primarily in compensation-related cost and strong growth in the PEO. The increase in compensation-related costs was driven by higher wages and performance-based compensation costs.\r\nOperating income net of certain items increased 9% for the second quarter and 10% for the 6 months to $283 million and $568 million, respectively. We maintained strong operating margins of 40%, but anticipate that our full year will remain within our guidance of approximately 38%. The second half of the fiscal year, consistent with prior years, is expected to result in lower margins, primarily due to higher selling and operations costs, which are variable, and more detail on that later.\r\nNet income increased 9% to $189 million for the second quarter and 16% to $398 million for the 6 months. Diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $0.52 per share for the second quarter and 17% to $1.10 per share for the 6 months. The 6-month period was positively impacted by the net tax benefit related to prior-year revenues that was recognized in the first quarter. When we exclude this impact, net income and diluted earnings per share would have risen 10% and 12%, respectively.\r\nLet's turn to payroll revenue. Payroll service revenue increased 4% for both the second quarter and 6 months to $427 million and $860 million, respectively. We benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increase. Net of discounting, checks per client really didn't benefit payroll revenue.\r\nHRS revenue increased 11% to $284 million for the second quarter and 13% to $564 million for the 6 months. This increase reflects strong growth in both clients and worksite employees of Paychex HR Services, which includes our ASO and PEO products. Insurance services benefited from continued growth of our ESR product that assists clients with health care reform and an increase in health and benefits applications together -- applicants, together with higher average premiums and clients and in workers' comp insurance product.  Our HR administration and time and attendance products contributed to the growth through robust sales of these solutions. Retirement services revenue benefited from growth in the number of plans and an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participant funds. Retirement services revenue growth was offset by pricing impacts in the respective prior-year period.\r\nLet's look at investments and income. Our goal, as you know, is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, we -- primary short-term investment vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts, high-quality commercial paper and variable-rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high-credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and an average duration of approximately 3.3 years.  Our combined portfolios have earned an average return of 1.1% for both the second quarter and the 6 months. \r\nOn December 16, as you all are aware, the Fed raised federal funds rates by 25 basis points, the first interest rate hike in nearly a decade. We expect the impact for the balance of the fiscal year will be modest.\r\nLet's take a look at our financial position. It remains strong, with cash and total corporate investments of $913 million. Funds held for clients as of November 30, 2015 were $3.7 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis, and they averaged $3.7 billion for the quarter and $3.8 billion for the 6 months.\r\nOur total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $34 million as of November 30, compared with net unrealized gains of $14 million as of May.\r\nTotal stockholder's equity was $1.9 billion, reflecting $304 million in dividends paid during the 6 months and 63 million of common shares repurchased. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 39%.\r\nCash flows from operations were $420 million for the first 6 months, a 4% increase from the prior year. This change was the result of higher net income on cash flow from operations, offset by fluctuations in working capital. The fluctuations in our working capital between periods were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll and income taxes.\r\nNow, I'd like to turn to fiscal 2016 guidance. Let me remind you first that our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions and that guidance for the full year is unchanged from the previous quarter. I'll reiterate our full-year ranges and then give some color on the back half of the year.\r\nPayroll service revenue anticipated to remain in the range of 4% to 5%, HRS in the range of 10% to 13%, total service revenue in the range of 7% to 8%, and net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 9%. Please note that the range excludes the benefit of the net tax benefit we recorded in the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year, excluding the impact of the net tax benefit discussed above, will be approximately 36%. \r\nOur interest on funds held for clients and operating margin are expected to be consistent with prior guidance.\r\nNow, current guidance doesn't include the announcement by the Fed of a 25 basis point change in rates. This is going to equate to approximately $1 million after-tax for the remainder of this fiscal year. On the call, I'll talk a little bit about why it may be more modest than you assume, but I would just say to preface that conversation that much of that impact won't be start to be felt until January, and then it will be modest. Our guidance also does not include any expectation of future increases. We don't look at forward rates to determine what guidance should be. We simply make an assumption once the Fed is active. There, obviously, is a chance that the Fed will continue to raise. We'll update guidance when that happens.\r\nFull year guidance currently excludes the impact to the Advance Partners acquisition that Marty referenced earlier and which we expect to close shortly. It is not expected to impact earnings in the current fiscal year, meaning it will not be dilutive in this year, neither will it be accretive in the balance of the fiscal year. I'll describe separately the impact of Advance shortly.\r\nSo while it isn't our typical practice to provide specific guidance on quarters, we do want to be as transparent as possible and provide you with some color on third and fourth quarter this year. Payroll revenue growth for the third quarter is anticipated to be at the lower end of the guidance range, while payroll revenue growth in the fourth quarter, we anticipate to be at the higher end of the range. As we stated in previous calls, the fourth quarter will benefit from one additional processing day this year. This was the case in the first quarter, as you all remember.\r\nHRS revenue growth for the third quarter is anticipated to fall below the low end of the full year guidance range, as we indicated in previous calls. I called that out when we started the year. This is a result of strong third quarter in the prior year, resulting from very strong PEO performance, and we had benefited from pricing in our retirement services businesses. While both are doing fine, they just simply don't -- are not as strong as they were in the prior year. For the fourth quarter, we expect HRS revenue growth will be within the full year range.\r\nIn addition, we anticipate, as is typically the case, higher selling expenses in the second half of the year. But this year, given the strength of our sales performance in the first 6 months of the year, we believe that selling expense will be higher than we had planned. We also anticipate higher operations expense due to stronger sales, that I just mentioned, and also very, very strong demand for our ACA compliance solution. So you'll feel much of that in the third quarter.\r\nAgain, current year guidance is not changed. So as I just mentioned, the guidance that I discussed doesn't include any impact from Advance Partners. So when we close, this is what the anticipate. For the balance of the year, we believe that the acquisition will contribute approximately 1% to payroll revenue growth and approximately 1.5% to HRS revenue growth. That's in the balance of the year, the second half. That impact will be -- primarily, will be split more towards the fourth quarter than the third quarter, because we anticipate that we'll only recognize 2 months of revenue in Q3. So the weighting will be a little bit more towards the fourth quarter. And we anticipate that additional expenses, operating expenses from the acquisition, will offset revenue in the balance of this year. It won't be dilutive, it won't be accretive, it will essentially be neutral.\r\nSo I hope that was clear. And with that, I'm going to turn it back to Marty for questions.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nThanks, Efrain. At this point, we will now open the call to your questions or comments. Operator?",
      "transcript_text3": "I wanted to start with a question on share buyback. I don't think you guys repurchased any shares in the quarter, and I believe you've got about $100 million left on the authorization. So I wanted to just get a sense of whether that was because you see some additional M&A opportunities of size in the pipeline beyond Advance Partners or did you just find the price of the stock not attractive enough, or any other factors at work there?\n\n---\n\nJason, that's a good question. I think I'd get a bat up side the head if I said the stock price wasn't attractive. But no...\n\n---\n\nYou're always very honest with us, though, Efrain.\n\n---\n\nYes, I am. I try to. No. We purchase opportunistically, so that's part of what our plan is. On the M&A front, I think there is an element of that. Advance was a nice acquisition. But I would say, as I've been saying now for a number of months, and finally, we have some evidence of this, the pipeline is robust, so we see a lot of opportunities for M&A in spaces we like at prices we like. So I think it's a combination of all those factors.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And so just as a follow-up, I guess, kind of a 2-part question. As we go into that key year-end selling season, how do you feel you're set up with the product set, the sales force capability? Should we expect the double-digit sales growth that you've been seeing to continue? And then just along with that, any macro comments about new business creation and general hiring trends that you'd like to share?\n\n---\n\nYes. This is Marty, Jason, I think we're feeling very good. We've got great sales momentum. Its continued Q1 and Q2, double-digit par growth and we would expect that to continue. This is a really important quarter, obviously, for us from a sales perspective, but we're going and with great momentum. In particular, in the mid-market, very strong in the mid-market, and this is something that the product development work and the technology has been so important for Flex, and we're really seeing that pay off. We're really seeing very strong results on the mid-market, even as competition is out there pretty consistently, and we've talked about that, we're really seeing very positive results from a growth perspective and what's sold. So we're going and feeling good about it. We feel like he product work that we've done, and some of it here this last quarter is when we introduced really the fully integrated time and attendance and benefit administration into Flex, positions us extremely well for this selling season and, frankly, ongoing future quarters.\n\n---\n\nAnd just the new business creation and small business hiring?\n\n---\n\nNew business -- yes, I'm sorry. In fact, our sales from new businesses is up, strong -- much -- quite a bit stronger than last year. So while the small business index would say that it's pretty consistent from an employment growth, I would say sales to new businesses are up a bit. So we're feeling pretty good about that. I wouldn't say it's a huge surge, but it's certainly consistent and up a few points from last year at this time. So I think that's very positive.\n\n---\n\nJust a high-level one about Advance Partners, understanding it hasn't closed yet. But when we're looking out to fiscal '17 and beyond, can you just give us a sense for what the sort of margin profile looks like, whether if it tucks right in, whether we can expect it to be sort of in line with the company average.\n\n---\n\nWell, that's a good question. What was interesting about Advance -- now, I'm going to exclude purchase accounting, because that will obviously impact it. But if you look at it from an EBITDA margin, what was really unusual about the business was it was pretty comparable to where Paychex was, which is saying something. I mean, we look at a lot of acquisitions. We run into very few that have very solid growth, very solid margins. They built a great business, not a flash in the pan. They've been at it for almost 20 years with a strong track record of growth.\n\n---\n\nYes. We feel, obviously, very good about the opportunity as well. So not only is it a good margin business, but as Efrain said, the leadership team there is staying with us and being part of Paychex. And they've built it over time, I think, very carefully and very strategically, and certainly, very profitably. So we think it's going to fit in extremely well. And we think that with our access to capital and product, we'll be able to accelerate -- in distribution, we're going to be able to accelerate their growth even more.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then just a question on Flex. So I think, Efrain, you mentioned in the past that Flex constitutes the majority of new sale, but you're not mandating client migration over to Flex. Is there a point where you can eventually stop offering some of the core products and really push the Flex product more to new sales? And then looking a couple of years from now, is there a reasonable, I guess, timetable for when you expect the majority of clients will have rolled over and then what impact you might see from a retention or margin...\n\n---\n\nYes, I think at this point, we're not forcing it. I think we're doing it the way we had hoped, which is this is attracting new clients and accelerating that -- those sales, by the way, to new clients, and it's attracting current clients to come over. So we're presenting that if you want -- you have certain needs from the product, that if you want to migrate over, you can. We're not pushing that too hard yet and we're not necessarily putting a kind of a drop-dead date on migrations. It's always better to be on the newest platform, but frankly, the existing platform is satisfying a lot of needs for existing clients, and many of them don't like to move. So I think that's -- we don't have a certain date, but we're going to handle it kind of carefully. And we're going to let the clients, at this point, do probably most of the movement and we're feeling good about that. Certainly, the new sales, the majority, and particularly in the mid-market, are all on Flex, and that's going extremely well.\n\n---\n\nThe other thing I'd add, Danyal is, just to put it in context, if I exclude Sure. And frankly, if I include it, it doesn't really change what I'm about to say. 90% plus of our clients are on either Flex or on Sure's platform, which frankly is a hybrid of Core Advanced and their own platform. So it's not a huge part of the base, obviously. We are selling primarily mid-market clients on the new platform.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then maybe a quick modeling question, if I could. You mentioned retirement services impacted the growth rate, I guess, over the trailing 4 quarters. Could you just quantify that?\n\n---\n\nI didn't catch the first part [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nThe retirement services, you, I think, changed pricing...\n\n---\n\nYes, yes, yes. It just -- that's basically what's causing the growth rate to drop a bit in addition to PEO. I won't qualify it anymore than that. But we periodically take pricing in different segments of the business. HRS is a little different than payroll, where payroll, it's pretty typical every year. HRS, we look at different products and try to gauge where market is, decided to take some of those actions last year and didn't repeat this year.\n\n---\n\nMarty, if you could kindly tell us what the selling season -- as you head into the selling season this quarter, how [indiscernible] compared with last year? Can you share any insights on the [indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\nSo S. K., if I heard your question -- sorry, I know you're traveling. The question was set up for the selling season compared to last year, how we feel about that? Was that what you asked?\n\n---\n\nExactly that. Exactly that.\n\n---\n\nYes. Sorry, I just couldn't make it out. The -- we feel very good about it. I mean, when you're carrying the kind of momentum, the good thing about selling season when you're heading into it is how did you kind of start the year, and particularly Q2, because that's kind of the beginning of it as you get into October and November, is very good. So when you're seeing double-digit growth in par, we had an increase in sales reps, but it was pretty small single-digit kind of increase that we normally have. To see double-digit in what we're selling and the par revenue that were selling consistently in Q1 and Q2, we feel good about Q3 and about the selling season. Now, you never know until you're kind of through January, but we feel very good about it. We've got full product suite, we've got full on-board of reps, of sales reps, we got very consistent at driving leadership that's there. So everything is very favorable for what we feel will be a very good selling season, great momentum going in.\n\n---\n\nAnd Efrain, probably on capital allocation, you talked about the pricing and then the pipeline. Are you clearly now more inclined to do more M&A, when compared to say things like special [ph] business?\n\n---\n\nI don't know if more M&A. It was always difficult to talk about a pipeline that no one saw except me, or Marty and I. But I think I would say at the margin, I wouldn't say we'll be on an accretive -- an acquisition tear here. But I said the margin, we have more things lined closer to being executed than we have in the past. So you'll see it. Now just before that gets misinterpreted, they're primarily tuck-in. I would say that Advance is a good example of the kinds of things that were looking at. We're not looking at large-scale, transformative M&A, but there are better opportunities out there and we're looking at opportunities to fill out both, product set and tuck-in to existing businesses.\n\n---\n\nAnd just a last one. There's obviously a lot of debate on the topic of if you had what kind of margin performance the larger [ph] solution carries. So just from your viewpoint, what are the margins have to be [indiscernible] on the long-term, but you have to take a hit on the near-term?\n\n---\n\nOh, yes, this is the perennial question. I think, S.K., look, we try to balance it. Obviously, if we can get much faster growth and sacrifice a little bit of margin, we'd look at that. But life doesn't present those neat dichotomies. A lot of what we look at is -- are acquisitions that we think at least won't be dilutive to our margins when we run across businesses that we think have good growth prospects. And I'd point to SurePayroll as an example of that, where when we initially bought it, it was dilutive to margins, and now, it's catching up to our margins. If we have a chance to improve the margins, then we'll take a bet early on to get something that will improve growth and help us to improve -- and we can improve their margins over time.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible] asking a question on [indiscernible] the margins you're getting from the solutions.\n\n---\n\nThe margins that we're getting from Advance Partners? Yes, I'd just say, if I heard your question correctly, they're, on an EBITDA basis, pretty close to Paychex corporate margins.\n\n---\n\nThis is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Could you just walk us through the largest drivers to your 80 basis points operating margin expansion this quarter?\n\n---\n\nOh, this quarter. I would say a lot of that was -- I would say it was primarily driven by lower operating expense in the quarter. So we went into the quarter with a certain expectation around what we needed in terms of operating expenses, came out of it a little bit lighter than we anticipated. That's really the primary driver.\n\n---\n\nGot it. Could you quantify net price increases that you're realizing in both payroll and HR Services this year?\n\n---\n\nI won't go any further than calling out what we typically say that on payroll, we're getting a 2% to 4% price increase, where you can assume that it's in that range. We don't typically call out HRS because it varies year-to-year. So we're getting some price increase. It's not certainly as good as I mentioned on the call as what we got last year. The other thing I would say, too, Rayna, is one of the things that's occurring, particularly on the payroll side, is with the sales force able to sell more full-featured packages, especially under 50, you get some mix benefit, too. So all of those things help our revenue per client picture.\n\n---\n\nEfrain, you talked a little bit about Advance Partners. Is this an acquisition or an industry that you think you have to build scale to really benefit from this? Or is this you'd like to see what you have and then determine if you want to take the next step about [ph] further consolidating?\n\n---\n\nI think if you mean by consolidating, acquiring more, I think -- I mean, we feel good that this was a really good fit for us. As Efrain mentioned, we've got a big pipeline that we look at. And as we looked at this company, here they are outsourcing support, payroll, fund -- and funding support to small and midsized staffing companies like 7,500 staffing companies, placing 200,000 temps a year. This is a nice business that -- there's a number of -- there's a few businesses that do this, but nobody as much, I think, to this scale, and have done it very thoughtfully over the years. I think as we look at the business, we've got clients with staffing companies that I think are great opportunities for the funding side of the business for them. And I think we've got a lot of product that we could offer to their clients. I think this is a good fit. We're going to see how this goes and -- but we're always looking to say, hey, if it makes sense both from our standpoint and from theirs as well, from their leadership, I think there may be some consolidation efforts that are available out there.\n\n---\n\nMarty, I know that this is a fairly small acquisition compared to the overall Paychex, but does this change the risk profile? Does this acquisition change the risk profile of the acquisitions you've looked at and the -- compared to the acquisitions you've looked at in the past?\n\n---\n\nI don't think so. I think we're always looking for -- as Efrain said, this has got a good, strong margin to it that's close to ours. It's got a nice solid -- it has nice, solid growth. I don't think it really changes the risk profile much. I think one of the great things that they did, frankly, was had very good risk policies and procedures to be sure. This is a bit of a trickier business to be sure you're handling the right risk and you're taking on the right risk, and they've just done a remarkable job. And I think with our risk team, our risk management team working with them, I think we can help that even more with more tools and more information. So I don't think it really changes the risk profile at all.\n\n---\n\nAnd then Efrain, on the float portfolio, one, any changes you're going to make as it seems as though the Fed is probably going to continue increasing rates. And two, is -- then is 25 basis points, about $2 million to net income, is that the right way to look at it on an annual basis? Or is there something different this time around that might mute the increase you would get in net income from rate increases?\n\n---\n\nOkay. 2 good questions. So Kartik, the simple answer is that it depends on the shape of the yield curve. And if the yield curve steepens, then you have one portfolio strategy approach. And if the yield curve stays relatively flat, you have another. So we look at that in the spring, so that's why I can't say definitively, hey, this is what it'll look like in '17. In addition, I'd like to see if the Fed does do something in the spring, it will certainly aid the portfolio. The question is how much and how we configure the portfolio. On the $2 million, yes, I don't think that's that far off, Kartik. The only trick and reason why I call out $1 million is that, number one, we don't really expect to see too much benefit except through -- or I'm sorry, until sometime in January. It's not the best timing because our balances increase significantly in December and beginning of January. By that time, we'll be past the peak of our balances, so we don't get quite as much. By the time you're talking February before we start to see a lot of the -- some of the benefits. You don't have that many months left in the year. So that's part of what's guiding it. And the final thing I'd say is that if you're looking at, for example, money market rates and what banks are doing, the effects of the interest rate increase are really kind of slow rolling. They'll eventually get there, but it's kind of a slow roll at this point.\n\n---\n\nJust following up on that last one on rates. Did I hear you, right, you're not including in the guidance the $1 million benefit you think you'll get from the Fed hike? And if I did hear that right, why not?\n\n---\n\nYes, no. I guess what I was trying to say was that it doesn't alter the guidance significantly. I am calling it out. It's about $1 million. It just doesn't change significantly kind of where we're at in terms of the guidance on interest rates.\n\n---\n\nGot you, okay. And I know you don't assume any future increases, but if -- in the guidance, but if the Fed did do what the Fed folks say, which is in next calendar year at 1.375%, I understand that it depends on the shape of the yield curve. But you do have about half the float in overnight stuff that will revalue pretty quickly, so we could start to see that really benefit if they do go through with that.\n\n---\n\nYes, yes. Hey, look, you're right, Gary. That's absolutely right. I'm not trying to be excessively conservative. I, obviously, am somewhat gun shy to tell people we think that, that's exactly what's going to happen. I'll tell you I'll be the happiest person around if that's where we end up. I am extremely hopeful. But you're right. That's exactly what would happen, that would ripple through the short-term portfolio and have a pretty significant impact on the stock.\n\n---\n\nOkay, good. I think the way you do it makes sense. And then just one question on sort of ACA-driven demand. I know in the last few years, HRS has been real strong as you've had sort of a broad halo effect. More customers are interested in considering their options in Europe, trusted source they'd turn to. But is -- should we think of the ACA compliance offering as having been a significant part of bookings and something that could drive some real acceleration in calendar '16? Or should we think -- because I know ADP has talked that way. Equifax, even with their ACA compliance, have seen just massive bookings growth? Or should we think that within the broader HRS portfolio, it's certainly a positive factor, but just one of many and more steady-as-she-goes continued strong growth?\n\n---\n\nI think it's -- I think I'd say steady-as-she-goes on HRS growth. I think it certainly is helping. I think it still remains to be seen after the first filing date kind of where clients fall out, and in this, are they going to stay with it? Are they -- are more clients going to come in? I think some will fall out that probably will say, hey, I didn't need it. And I think others will say, I should've had it, and will add. So I think we'll still have good sales with ESR, the ACA product, through '16 kind of calendar year, because I think some things will fall out -- I think some clients will fall out and realize they should have had the product and didn't and then didn't file, because we're already getting calls like that now, like, hey, what do I do and it's a little bit late to gather all that information. So I think it's a little bit early, but it's very positive. We've seen great acceptance of the product. And frankly, as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we've had to ramp up some costs in the quarter to kind of handle all of the inflow of data and everything that clients are giving us. So I think it'll still be a positive right through the calendar year.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then just one quick one. As you add on these incremental components to the Flex offering, is -- should we think of it as a material revenue opportunity to have existing customers sort of turn those on? Or is there more of a sales effort that'll take some time to drive that incremental revenue if you add these important components?\n\n---\n\nYes. Sure. I think it'll take a little bit of time, I think. We kind of make sure that we're bringing the clients along carefully. I mean, we're paying close attention. Now the operations team and the client retention teams talking to those clients realize there's a net benefit then we make the sale of the additional products and turn on those additional modules. The best -- the biggest benefit is when you're selling the entire product combined to the new clients, but we are certainly going back and marketing to the base that you now have available more modules that you can turn on. So I think there's certainly an opportunity there, but we're not going to rush it and kind of blitz the base. We're kind of letting the clients get comfortable with Flex and then show them that there's additional modules, which will help not only sales but retention more importantly as well.\n\n---\n\nA couple follow-ups. On Advance Partners, you talked about a 1.7 -- 1.5% increase in the HRS side from that, eventually, what categories is that in? Are those categories new to you like the financing?\n\n---\n\nYes, yes, it's other. That's primarily the financing part of the business. So it would be HRS other, we'll have to figure out longer-term kind of where it goes. The other part, just to anticipate a question someone will ask, the other part is payroll services. The business is split pretty evenly between the 2.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And Marty mentioned that MMS is growing strongly now. Besides the obvious competitors, is that coming from any other sources? An expansion of the market? Or just where do you think that's coming from?\n\n---\n\nI think there are some expansion in the fact that, as we've talked about, the need for the total product set has come down. So I think there's more clients in that 50-plus maybe 50 to 150 employees that are needing more product and more services and they're out. They may have been on an in-house solution and that was more -- much more simple and they needed more, they needed time and attendance. They needed HR administration. They needed benefits admin -- administration. So I think that though -- I do think the market is expanding a bit in the fact of who needs the complete suite of services, which has been positive. But I also think obviously we're taking share from some competitors as well, even though there's more competitors kind of out there and talking about things, I think you've seen a little bit more share we're taking now as we have a complete product set, HCM suite of cloud-based SaaS services.\n\n---\n\nJust wanted to clarify a couple of things. I guess, the comments on Advance, that revenue contribution of 1 point to payroll, 1.5 point to HRS, that's for the 6 months left in the fiscal year? Is that the right way to think about it?\n\n---\n\nThat's correct, Tim. Yes, [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nYou'll only have it for 5. So if we're thinking about the quarterly run rate, it's quarterly contribution, I guess, in a full quarter, it's higher than that so?\n\n---\n\nYes, yes. It would be. So yes, assuming we close this month which we, in all likelihood, will do, we expect to close shortly. Yes, you'd have 2 months in Q3 and then 3 months in Q4.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Did you quantify the size of the purchase price I guess, we'll see it in the [indiscernible] eventually.\n\n---\n\nNo, you'll see it. You'll see it.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And the comment about retirement, about pricing, I guess, I wasn't clear exactly. Is the comment just you are taking less price than you did a year ago, so the growth rate is lower or it's a -- it wasn't a one-time bump last year that was a one-time revenue source I guess?\n\n---\n\nWe review pricing along all of our businesses and periodically, and HRS in particular, don't necessarily, in a given year, increase price but may increase it. So.\n\n---\n\nDid you see some sort of client pushback that -- why you took -- didn't take price again this year?\n\n---\n\nNo, no. We just -- we try to figure out what -- we do a lot of work on pricing to figure out what makes sense so we don't end up having an attrition or retention problem.\n\n---\n\nI guess, the first one, just on the minimum premium plan, on the PEO. You had it in a place now for over a year, just wondering if you could sort of talk about the success that you've seen there? If you have any plans to extend it further? And then any impact on the risk in the PEO book?\n\n---\n\nI think, no, we've done a good job on the risk as we handle that very carefully. And I think the sales and the risk management team there have worked very well together, which is what we expect and they've done a good job. I think it's been very successful. I think it's fairly limited to the area, but it's done well. And I think we're always looking at ways to expand it if that opportunity presents itself. And so we're very open to doing that.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just following up, wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the margins again? Can you just remind us sort of what your investment plans are for areas like IT? I think you had talked about in the past, now, it's sort of growing in line with revenue, is that the right...\n\n---\n\nIt's took on a little faster than revenue. It probably will continue to grow a little bit faster than revenue. It just was growing at significantly higher than revenue growth. So I think it's moderated a bit. But I think if you're in the technology-enabled services business, tech spending is going to outpace revenue growth, at least over the intermediate term. It will do that for us and that's just the price of being in the business. And we have to -- we look at other ways to leverage the business to ensure that we deliver the bottom line.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just the last question. Just sort of philosophically here with the Advance Partners acquisition, just wondering how much of it was interest in adding more capabilities in the staffing market, more in line with the stuff that you already do? And how much of it was getting some of the funding stuff, so it's sort of expanding your services? And in future acquisitions, how much to either of those 2 -- bulking up the existing versus expanding into new plan to it?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's an interesting -- I think it's a little bit of both. I mean always -- we're looking for -- to drive top line growth and continue to leverage and being a very profitable company, it makes the M&A very tight, the selection very tight, and get it at a very valuable -- a good value. So I think it's a little bit of both. I think we can expand -- what we saw was a great opportunity, just as you said it take what their products are and expanded it to a number of clients that we have that are staffing firms, small to mid-size staffing firms. And we think that's an immediate benefit. And then also, adding more, not only product to what they're offering, but the access to capital. This business needs capital -- access to capital to be able to continue to grow the funding business and we certainly have that, not only in cash, but in access to more capital besides. So we think between the 2 of them, we can accelerate their growth, and therefore, our growth, and do it at a very profitable way to do it. So this was the perfect fit for us and it's very much focused on that small to mid-sized staffing firm, which there's thousands, 10,000 of them. And I think they had a very decent market share, but still a lot of room to grow. So very good. And we think that temporary staffing business, frankly, is going to continue to grow. We're seeing part-time employment has grown almost 2 -- almost 3 percentage points in the last 2 years. So we think that with overtime rules, ACA and a number of other requirements, the staffing business and temporary employee business is going to continue to grow, we want to be part of it.\n\n---\n\nThe gig economy is here to stay.\n\n---\n\nLast week, when Congress signed the year-end budget bill, there were a number of so-called tax extenders that were extended over longer time periods than they usually are. I know one of your competitors went out trumpeting one them specifically the WOTC, the work opportunity tax credit. Is that something you think it'll be an advantage to you? Are there any other items that were in there that might be something to help us spur business going forward?\n\n---\n\nI think just generally, all of those, they all encourage or they tend to encourage, most of them investment, new business startups and existing businesses to invest more in their business and to give some tax benefit for that. I think that's all positive, it all makes the economy stronger. I think the fact that if those had expired, I think, would've dampened the investment in -- particularly in small to mid-sized businesses. So I think they're all positive. I don't think there was anyone that would stand out to us to be that big of a benefit. But they certainly are all positive for the overall business environment.\n\n---\n\nAll right. That's helpful. And Efrain, I'm apologizing in advance, I've got another interest rate question for you. You mentioned, I think, you were going to relook at the strategy in the spring. Is that because you're just doing planning for next year or you're anticipating interest rate increases coming in the spring?\n\n---\n\nI think it's both, Jeff. So the -- how you configure the portfolio, not to go into a long digression here, I won't bore you, but what ADP did -- does is different than what we do. They borrow short term, they invest long term. We don't do that to a significant extent. We just haven't seen the value-add in recent years to do that. But the shape of the yield curve really has a big impact on whether you do that or you don't do that. And so we're a little bit in wait and see. We think the -- our internal betting is that the Fed will probably raise again in the spring. And then it'll start to become a little bit more clear to us what the shape of that yield curve is going to be so we can plan into '17. So it's a little bit of both.\n\n---\n\nSo I just wanted to start off with a clarification question with the -- with the guidance being what it is. It does include a few months of Advance. It does include the modest impact of higher interest rates. What you're really saying is that neither of those factors, taken together, is enough to change your guidance profile but they're still included in there?\n\n---\n\nThat's correct, Ashwin. That's the point. So we could characterize it in a number of different ways. But the guidance ranges that we give, even with all of those changes at this point, we don't anticipate significant change from what we said at the beginning of the year.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then conceptually, as your sales force sells a wider range of products, so you kind of include Advance in there, for example, and it's a more complex offering, that makes sense in terms of revenue per client. But as you try to manage that, what specifically is the forward risk profile associated with payroll funding, which frankly it's not a -- not an end market that I fully understand yet. And does that mean a need for more sales force training, more expense in that area?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think that one, Ashwin, that it will be sold by a specific sales force. It may be referred and it very much will be referred by the broader sales force. But that sale is very specific to -- and something that Advance has done a very good job on is having highly trained sales reps who bring a proper risk client -- risk profile client to them, then it goes through underwriting as well. So that's why I think they've done a very good job on risk. So it won't have to -- we won't have to train our entire sales force. We'll look for them-- we'll train them on the opportunity and the product, but just to get the referral to the other -- to a specific sales force that will evaluate the risk profile of the opportunity and then bring it to underwriting.\n\n---\n\nThe other thing, Ashwin, is that we liked about the business was that as I said, approximately half of what they sell are services that we're very, very, very familiar with. So they are selling payroll and outsourcing services. But in a particular vertical, which happens to be these staffing firms. So the profile really is not significantly different other than the funding piece of it that we think they do exceptionally well.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And I apologize if this was asked, but I have to hop off for just a brief bit, the push-out of certain elements of ACA, Cadillac tax specifically, is that -- I mean, how are you thinking about that for your specific client base, does it have an impact?\n\n---\n\nI don't think that one has an impact. And very much in our small to mid-size businesses. I don't think you usually -- they won't normally run into that issue. So I don't think it will. It's -- I do think it's going to be a very interesting, still, year -- calendar year ahead of us in '16 for the Affordable Care Act products. Right now, as I said -- I did mention this earlier, that the demand has been very strong, and in fact, we've added some expense to support all that inflow of data from clients. And I think that the sales will kind of, some clients may say hey, after the filing date, I don't always need this. I don't need this product. Others will realize that they did need it and there'll be another kind of surge in sales I think in '16. So I think the sales will still continue to be pretty strong in calendar year '16.\n\n---\n\nGot it. My last question really is -- and this is potentially a few months too early. But do you worry about the interest-rate sensitivity, obviously, higher interest rates is good for you, but interest-rate sensitivity of your client base? I mean, do they care, I was just looking at one of your shared payroll service which applies to a piece of your client base, 45% of clients don't care but that means 55% do care. Any thoughts there?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think -- first of all, for new business, small businesses and those who are starting up typically don't go through a bank for their credit anyway. So I don't think there'll be too impacted by a number of increases that -- until it gets much higher. So I don't think we're going to see a big impact on small business to start. They usually use other funding sources and so forth. So I don't think a big impact there. I think mid-size businesses that are more capital-intensive, that need to borrow, will see some impact as the rates start to go up, but in the near future it's hard to anticipate that they're going to up enough to drive that much impact to them, Efrain?\n\n---\n\nI'd agree.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of follow-up questions. Have you guys thought about using your balance sheet more to do small business lending?\n\n---\n\nWe've thought about it. There's -- it's a pretty crowded space out there with a number of companies out there doing it. And we have -- we continue to look at that as an opportunity. We are -- we have some partnership with the Vista Credit and do some referrals with them. But we've continued to look at the business as well. But it's a pretty crowded space these days.\n\n---\n\nYes, yes. You guys just have pretty good access to financials. So you would have a pretty good idea of good and bad loan potential, so I thought it would be kind of an interesting option.\n\n---\n\nYes, we have watched it.\n\n---\n\nI just want to ask about retention going into the big selling season. How do you guys feel about retention going forward coming into the selling season here?\n\n---\n\nYes. Pretty good. So far at this point, we're feeling good. When we talked earlier about a price increase and we held our price increase. We've held the increase well and our retention is near its historic best. And so it's early because you really get that best sense at the end of December and into January, but at this point, we feel good about it. Our retention's continuing to hold.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then can you quantify -- you talked about sales growth being double digits and ahead of plan, can you quantify how much ahead of plan that is?\n\n---\n\nNo, but it's strong. I would just say this, Bryan. So I called out higher sales expenses which I typically don't do, because we've got a range and, frankly, The Street can figure out what that range is. But I would say, through the first 6 months, when we were preparing for the call, we had a discussion about whether to call it out. Because some quarters, you have better sales growth than you have -- than others, but given the strength of what we've seen in the back 6 months and in our planning process, we thought we had to out add to selling expense because they are off to a very strong start. So it's strong by our standards. Yes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then the common question were going to get on that is how does that translate, that strong sales, the double digits, into revenue growth, maybe just remind his, Efrain, best way to think about that.\n\n---\n\nYes. Typically, you're not seeing that sales growth probably for another 4 to 6 months going forward. So there is a bit of a lag. Some of it, you see as soon as 2 to 3 months, some of it, a little bit longer cycle because you have to set clients up. So you start to see that translating into '17 sales.\n\n---\n\nSo a question first on ACA. How did the adoption of the compliance product trend during the second quarter, and I guess what I'm wondering is you'd talked about being at about 50% adoption last quarter and that had been up from 25% to 33% in the prior quarter, so I'm wondering kind of what the penetration is looking like?\n\n---\n\nI think it's a little bit higher than that, Sara, but not dramatically higher. We never thought that we'd get 100% adoption in the base because there are other solutions out there. So I think we're trending above -- certainly, above 50%. But it's not 100%, and we don't anticipate that it will be.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then a quick question on Advance Partners. How cyclical has their business been in the past given the end market?\n\n---\n\nYes, not very. I mean, obviously, I guess, there's countercurrents. I haven't looked at where they were in '08 or '09. But they've had a pretty steady track record of growth. You can argue that when things take a downturn you actually have slightly increased demand for temporary versus full-time employees. So -- but their growth pattern has been pretty steady. That was one of the things that we looked at.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Maybe they were taking good share in the last downturn.\n\n---\n\nIt could. In any event, it could.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, so you talked about sales expense being higher. Did you change the plans for sales headcount growth. I think you had talked about 3% this fiscal year versus 4% to 5% last year?\n\n---\n\nNo, no. Yes, no we didn't -- I mean, whatever we said at the beginning of the year is still holding. We're above in sales heads particularly on the payroll side. So that's true. When we call out higher sale expense, it's not headcount, it's because our sales are variable. And so if we anticipate that sales is going to have a good selling season, which is what we believe will happen. And we rarely, rarely talk about it that way. We're a little bit more cautious, then we just bump expenses. And so right now, The Street models that I've seen in third quarter are not taking into account that selling expense. So.\n\n---\n\nSo just as a follow-up on that, the sales expense is up not because of headcount but because of better performance. It takes about 4 to 6 months. If it's up double digits, then what sort of incremental bump does that do to revenue relative to a steady-state?\n\n---\n\nYes. I guess, Mark, I won't go through the arithmetic, but I think the thing always to remember is that our revenue retention average is about 86%. So you get a little bit of effect this year and then you get the rest of it next year. In order for you -- when people ask me this question, in order for you to start accelerating up to double digits, you'd have really have a period of -- a multiyear period of very strong sales performance. Now we hope we're somewhat on that trend. But you need more than one to make it occur. That's part A. Part B of the explanation, which is going to lead me to part C. Part B is simply to say that sales is one component of the equation. Obviously, retention is the other component of the equation and how the pieces of that fit together when we put together a plan tells me where sales growth is going to go. You have seen that in the last 3 years, certainly, even excluding the impacts of the minimum premium plan. We've seen revenue bump up because sales, the leading indicator, has been growing. So C is simply that I'll have to get to '17 when I give you guidance. But I think we feel good. If we see this kind of sales growth continue through the year, that's going to be a positive for next year.\n\n---\n\nYes, so all other things being equal, I mean, we should end up seeing total services revenue accelerate slightly, at least.\n\n---\n\nI would say, if we continue with this strong performance, yes.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then how much -- can you just remind us what the ACA ERS is adding in terms of revenue?\n\n---\n\nWe don't disclose it. It's -- what's tricky about that is if I were to give you a number, I'd have to say also then that ESR cuts both ways in that it represents an opportunity for additional sales, but it's also other sales that we might not get because people are focused on selling it. And there's a tremendous amount of demand. So it's buried in the HRS number and that's about as far as we'll go.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And is all of advanced on HRS?\n\n---\n\nNo, no. That's -- Mark, so I called out very carefully the balance of the year, I think to [indiscernible] earlier. So I called out a 1% increase for the balance of year on payroll service revenue and 1.5% on HRS for the balance of the year. Balance of the year is 10 -- I mentioned earlier, is about 5 months or so that we expect. So no, actually the business is evenly split between Payroll Services, what we would consider Payroll Services revenue, and funding, which we're going to lump into HRS for now until we figure out where a better category is for.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And Advance is growing double digits?\n\n---\n\nYes, they are. And strongly profitable.\n\n---\n\nYes. And so the pipeline that you mentioned, I mean, how rare is it to see something that's reasonably priced, growing at a decent rate and as profitable as you are?\n\n---\n\nWell, when we disclose the cash flows you guys can determine, I should say you guys, but you can determine how reasonable the price is, but we thought it was a reasonable price for the prospects of the business. It is fairly rare, I would say that.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Any thoughts with regards to sales headcount going into next year? How are you thinking about trending that?\n\n---\n\nYes, I would think, Mark, it would be consistent. I mean, we're depending on which area and so forth, we're just kind of getting into studying that now, and it will actually after selling season. But I think we would continue to probably increase a little bit more. You may see a little bit more virtual because that's where we've seen more of the growth in the last few years. But they're still -- field resources would continue to go up as well.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then one last question, just on the International front, whether you are thinking about Germany or Brazil, any updates there?\n\n---\n\nGermany is continued to, I think, do well. The client base is really getting up there. Performance is -- so sales performance is good and retention is very good, so I think we're doing well there. And Brazil has just been slower than we expected. A number of things have changed, the economy's not as strong. There's some political stuff going on and the legislation that we expected, that would be more of a disruptor, which was requiring more electronic filing for small businesses, has been delayed now for a couple of years. We expect it to still get done, but it's taking longer. So that disruption to drive more payroll from accountants into a third party has been slower, much slower to happen than we expected.\n\n---\n\nI'd say the other thing, Mark, just to build on what Marty said, we remain interested in building out the international portion of the business, and M&A is also focused on looking at those opportunities, too.\n\n---\n\nI have a question, you've talked for a couple new quarters now about the transition to this bundled selling approach out in the field. Can you give an idea within HRS, parse a little bit the relative growth rates of the ancillary services and how they've been impacted by that bundled selling approach versus the ASO PEO piece of HRS?\n\n---\n\nWe don't really break it down to that level, but it definitely has helped our attachment rate at the beginning of the sale. Our old approach was, hey, we'll sell payroll -- this is particularly to small businesses, we'll sell you payroll and then come back with different sales forces. And this team selling now at the 20 employee or so size has really gone much, much better. It's still early in the process, but were seeing nice results for the clients. Not only is it we're selling more of a complete bundle, but also the clients have a -- they're happier because they weren't looking for just payroll, they were looking for more and we're being able to satisfy them the right way, I think, upfront but we don't really break it down much more than that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then the second one is Flex-related. You mentioned that, that -- I think you mentioned that, that is appealing to a more of a mid-market client. Can you give an idea of what size of client you're seeing sort of a new uptick in, in terms of demand, and I guess any other kind of changes or differences you're noticing about Flex?\n\n---\n\nYes, first of all, as Efrain said, the majority of the clients are on Flex. What I should say is the mid-market, that 50-plus are -- it's more interested in the full bundle, the suite of -- complete suite of products. So Flex can be payroll only. It can be a complete bundle of services. And we're seeing bigger uptake in the bundle for those, probably even 20 and above, because that need has come down. So I think it's just time and attendance, for example. In the past, you'd be at a pretty good-size -- necessarily an employee size before you'd be interested in time and attendance. Now with overtime rules, Affordable Care Act, and also, by the way, the technology of time and attendance, there's just a much greater need for it. Clients want it. It's easier. You can do it on your mobile app. Now clients get -- client employees can punch in and out on their phone. So there's -- we've -- I think the need has driven down in size and the technology and our breadth of products and mobility has made it a lot easier for clients to incorporate it into their businesses. So I think the impact there is that the majority of clients are on Flex and the 20-plus, 30-plus employee clients are taking much more of a full suite or some portion of that suite of products.\n\n---\n\nI headed [ph] for a minute, so if this has been answered it, we can take these offline but I just had a couple of very quick follow-ups. So the first is, I think your commentary implied that your checks for clients were relatively flat, and can you remind us is -- is that a function of where we are in the cycle? Or is there something else driving that metric?\n\n---\n\nYes. So David, if you look at our average client size, we're bouncing around 17 or so. And it's really nothing more than the fact that under 50, we're -- we were having a lot of -- a lot more growth than we were in previous years. And you have a tendency there -- that has a tendency to depress the number of checks per client. If I same-store it, you're at somewhere between 0 to 1%. So because checks per client are not really a significant contributor, we really just don't call it out. So that's basically the dynamic of what's occurring. As you grow that, you tend to see that impact.\n\n---\n\nRight. I guess I was just trying to reconcile that with your commentary about some of the growth momentum in your new bookings as being driven by MMS.\n\n---\n\nGood point. And I think that's a fair point, it's early in the cycle. So if in the end, we were to start skewing higher then you would see that pop-up. But it's going to take a little bit of time before you start to see that.\n\n---\n\nAll right. And then the second question I had was on HRS. I think I understand the impact of the retirement services, pricing action, however, what, if anything, may be going on in the underlying PEO business, just curious what the trends are in that business relative to where they've been, because they've been relatively strong I think we can [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nYes, they're still very, very strong. So just to remind you what's buried or not buried, what's included in HRS. So you got Insurance services, you got HR Outsourcing. You have retirement services. And you have actually online services. And I'll just remind everyone that when we had the Investor Day, I said we really need to kind of think about how we represent payroll services going forward, because it really doesn't capture the activity that's going on in that segment of revenue. Having said all of that, PEO still is relatively small as a percentage of revenue for the company as a whole and even within HRS. It's still, certainly, well south of 50%. But it's growing very, very rapidly, faster -- much faster than HRS is growing as a whole.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think it's still -- it's a very strong market for the product, particularly, with the Affordable Care Act and the need for HR -- more HR because of the regulations and so forth. So yes, it continues to be very strong demand.\n\n---\n\nAll right. So no -- to the takeaway, there's no change in trajectory of that business despite the growth rate of the category?\n\n---\n\nNo, we feel pretty optimistic about that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just one final question. I guess, there have been several questions about the bookings momentum that you're reporting. Can you help us -- I mean, you called out MMS as being a component of that momentum. But is there anything else in there in terms of mix, whether it be a fully outsourced solution versus not, you cited revenue per client going up with more modules being purchased. But just curious if there's any kind of new trend emerging that may be driving that metric up.\n\n---\n\nWell, I think, obviously, employee shared responsibility helps too, so that's part of the equation there. But if I look at all of the different sales forces and the products that they sell, the combined effect is really strong. We don't have sales forces that -- we don't have any that are performing under where we expect. So we've got a lot of cylinders hitting all at once. So.\n\n---\n\nI think the mid-market is the strongest, if you looked at that. That's been the biggest, strong, and PEO and HR outsourcing have been particularly strong, as Efrain has mentioned. So I think overall though, is we've seen nice growth in all of the sales forces, nice par growth. But the leaders have been, at this stage, the mid-market. And they have a -- remember, they have a much fuller product suite now, and 2 components just -- were just added, fully integrated. And so they are selling a higher revenue per client. And their success is up. So...\n\n---\n\nJust want to ask on PEO demand as we cross into the new calendar year. Any change in your thinking around global demand, in general, for PEO?\n\n---\n\nNo, it has continued to be strong. And selling season will kind of tell the tale here, but it continues to be very strong, and frankly, has picked up in some parts of the country where we've added more reps, where we were not selling as much PEO. So no, I think the demand there is still good and looks sustainable.\n\n---\n\nOkay, good. Just one more, just on the HRS side, I know we always sweat rounding and whatnot, but I think you mentioned that it was going to fall below the 10% to 13% range. I mean, are we talking about a rounding to 9% kind of issue? Or is it going to be much different from that?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Tien-tsin, for asking the question everyone's figuring out. So yes, we're -- we anticipate somewhere in that 9% range.\n\n---\n\nOkay, like I said [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nNo, no, short question.\n\n---\n\nJust 2 questions and clarifications. The first one is sort of the bookings momentum commentary. If I recall, the kind of the last couple of quarters have been strong as well. So is it -- did we accelerate in terms of booking momentum? Or is this more just sort of sustainable trends we've seen over the last few quarters? Just sort of how you would characterize that?\n\n---\n\nI think it's sustained. I think it's up a little stronger, practically in the mid-market. But it's sustained double-digit for the last, at least the last few quarters. So I'd say, it's up a little bit, but it's certainly, and that's a good thing it's not like it popped up one quarter and then it slowed down. We've seen some nice momentum going into the selling season here.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just to clarify, Efrain, on Advance Partners. You sort of in your prepared comments, you said it was excluded from the guidance, and then I think in a response to a question, said included in guidance. It may be just a nuance, but maybe the answer is just that it doesn't move the needle enough. But I kind of just want to check my math that it's like 60 basis points to growth and 120 basis points in the back half.\n\n---\n\nYes, Glenn. So what I was trying to do was carefully parse 2 things. First, tell you what growth looked like before I added in Advance Partners, right? So I talked about that. And then after I did that, I said, okay, after you've gotten that right, because you got to get your models right, then what does -- what will Advance include when it is closed? So that's when I said in the balance of the year, whatever your models say based on what I guided you to, you're going to get about 1% in the balance of the year for payroll service revenue growth and 1.5% for HRS growth in the balance of the year. And it was clarified that, that's probably going to be about 5 months or so. So I just was trying to say the overlay of Advance looks like that. When you put all that together with guidance we've given for the year, we're still overall within the range of guidance that we provided for the year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just a quick math on a full-year run rate, something like $35 million of revenue, is that reasonable?\n\n---\n\nI see where your math works, and I can't disagree with it.\n\n---\n\nOkay, I think that's all the questions. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived until approximately January 22. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our second quarter press release conference call, and for your interest in Paychex. We very much appreciate that. We wish you all a very happy, happy holiday season. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nI wanted to start with a question on share buyback. I don't think you guys repurchased any shares in the quarter, and I believe you've got about $100 million left on the authorization. So I wanted to just get a sense of whether that was because you see some additional M&A opportunities of size in the pipeline beyond Advance Partners or did you just find the price of the stock not attractive enough, or any other factors at work there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nJason, that's a good question. I think I'd get a bat up side the head if I said the stock price wasn't attractive. But no...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nYou're always very honest with us, though, Efrain.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, I am. I try to. No. We purchase opportunistically, so that's part of what our plan is. On the M&A front, I think there is an element of that. Advance was a nice acquisition. But I would say, as I've been saying now for a number of months, and finally, we have some evidence of this, the pipeline is robust, so we see a lot of opportunities for M&A in spaces we like at prices we like. So I think it's a combination of all those factors.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nOkay. And so just as a follow-up, I guess, kind of a 2-part question. As we go into that key year-end selling season, how do you feel you're set up with the product set, the sales force capability? Should we expect the double-digit sales growth that you've been seeing to continue? And then just along with that, any macro comments about new business creation and general hiring trends that you'd like to share?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. This is Marty, Jason, I think we're feeling very good. We've got great sales momentum. Its continued Q1 and Q2, double-digit par growth and we would expect that to continue. This is a really important quarter, obviously, for us from a sales perspective, but we're going and with great momentum. In particular, in the mid-market, very strong in the mid-market, and this is something that the product development work and the technology has been so important for Flex, and we're really seeing that pay off. We're really seeing very strong results on the mid-market, even as competition is out there pretty consistently, and we've talked about that, we're really seeing very positive results from a growth perspective and what's sold. So we're going and feeling good about it. We feel like he product work that we've done, and some of it here this last quarter is when we introduced really the fully integrated time and attendance and benefit administration into Flex, positions us extremely well for this selling season and, frankly, ongoing future quarters.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nAnd just the new business creation and small business hiring?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nNew business -- yes, I'm sorry. In fact, our sales from new businesses is up, strong -- much -- quite a bit stronger than last year. So while the small business index would say that it's pretty consistent from an employment growth, I would say sales to new businesses are up a bit. So we're feeling pretty good about that. I wouldn't say it's a huge surge, but it's certainly consistent and up a few points from last year at this time. So I think that's very positive.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Danyal Hussain (Analysts)】\nJust a high-level one about Advance Partners, understanding it hasn't closed yet. But when we're looking out to fiscal '17 and beyond, can you just give us a sense for what the sort of margin profile looks like, whether if it tucks right in, whether we can expect it to be sort of in line with the company average.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nWell, that's a good question. What was interesting about Advance -- now, I'm going to exclude purchase accounting, because that will obviously impact it. But if you look at it from an EBITDA margin, what was really unusual about the business was it was pretty comparable to where Paychex was, which is saying something. I mean, we look at a lot of acquisitions. We run into very few that have very solid growth, very solid margins. They built a great business, not a flash in the pan. They've been at it for almost 20 years with a strong track record of growth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. We feel, obviously, very good about the opportunity as well. So not only is it a good margin business, but as Efrain said, the leadership team there is staying with us and being part of Paychex. And they've built it over time, I think, very carefully and very strategically, and certainly, very profitably. So we think it's going to fit in extremely well. And we think that with our access to capital and product, we'll be able to accelerate -- in distribution, we're going to be able to accelerate their growth even more.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Danyal Hussain (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then just a question on Flex. So I think, Efrain, you mentioned in the past that Flex constitutes the majority of new sale, but you're not mandating client migration over to Flex. Is there a point where you can eventually stop offering some of the core products and really push the Flex product more to new sales? And then looking a couple of years from now, is there a reasonable, I guess, timetable for when you expect the majority of clients will have rolled over and then what impact you might see from a retention or margin...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think at this point, we're not forcing it. I think we're doing it the way we had hoped, which is this is attracting new clients and accelerating that -- those sales, by the way, to new clients, and it's attracting current clients to come over. So we're presenting that if you want -- you have certain needs from the product, that if you want to migrate over, you can. We're not pushing that too hard yet and we're not necessarily putting a kind of a drop-dead date on migrations. It's always better to be on the newest platform, but frankly, the existing platform is satisfying a lot of needs for existing clients, and many of them don't like to move. So I think that's -- we don't have a certain date, but we're going to handle it kind of carefully. And we're going to let the clients, at this point, do probably most of the movement and we're feeling good about that. Certainly, the new sales, the majority, and particularly in the mid-market, are all on Flex, and that's going extremely well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThe other thing I'd add, Danyal is, just to put it in context, if I exclude Sure. And frankly, if I include it, it doesn't really change what I'm about to say. 90% plus of our clients are on either Flex or on Sure's platform, which frankly is a hybrid of Core Advanced and their own platform. So it's not a huge part of the base, obviously. We are selling primarily mid-market clients on the new platform.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Danyal Hussain (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then maybe a quick modeling question, if I could. You mentioned retirement services impacted the growth rate, I guess, over the trailing 4 quarters. Could you just quantify that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI didn't catch the first part [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【質問: Danyal Hussain (Analysts)】\nThe retirement services, you, I think, changed pricing...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, yes, yes. It just -- that's basically what's causing the growth rate to drop a bit in addition to PEO. I won't qualify it anymore than that. But we periodically take pricing in different segments of the business. HRS is a little different than payroll, where payroll, it's pretty typical every year. HRS, we look at different products and try to gauge where market is, decided to take some of those actions last year and didn't repeat this year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Siva Borra (Analysts)】\nMarty, if you could kindly tell us what the selling season -- as you head into the selling season this quarter, how [indiscernible] compared with last year? Can you share any insights on the [indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nSo S. K., if I heard your question -- sorry, I know you're traveling. The question was set up for the selling season compared to last year, how we feel about that? Was that what you asked?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Siva Borra (Analysts)】\nExactly that. Exactly that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. Sorry, I just couldn't make it out. The -- we feel very good about it. I mean, when you're carrying the kind of momentum, the good thing about selling season when you're heading into it is how did you kind of start the year, and particularly Q2, because that's kind of the beginning of it as you get into October and November, is very good. So when you're seeing double-digit growth in par, we had an increase in sales reps, but it was pretty small single-digit kind of increase that we normally have. To see double-digit in what we're selling and the par revenue that were selling consistently in Q1 and Q2, we feel good about Q3 and about the selling season. Now, you never know until you're kind of through January, but we feel very good about it. We've got full product suite, we've got full on-board of reps, of sales reps, we got very consistent at driving leadership that's there. So everything is very favorable for what we feel will be a very good selling season, great momentum going in.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Siva Borra (Analysts)】\nAnd Efrain, probably on capital allocation, you talked about the pricing and then the pipeline. Are you clearly now more inclined to do more M&A, when compared to say things like special [ph] business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI don't know if more M&A. It was always difficult to talk about a pipeline that no one saw except me, or Marty and I. But I think I would say at the margin, I wouldn't say we'll be on an accretive -- an acquisition tear here. But I said the margin, we have more things lined closer to being executed than we have in the past. So you'll see it. Now just before that gets misinterpreted, they're primarily tuck-in. I would say that Advance is a good example of the kinds of things that were looking at. We're not looking at large-scale, transformative M&A, but there are better opportunities out there and we're looking at opportunities to fill out both, product set and tuck-in to existing businesses.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Siva Borra (Analysts)】\nAnd just a last one. There's obviously a lot of debate on the topic of if you had what kind of margin performance the larger [ph] solution carries. So just from your viewpoint, what are the margins have to be [indiscernible] on the long-term, but you have to take a hit on the near-term?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nOh, yes, this is the perennial question. I think, S.K., look, we try to balance it. Obviously, if we can get much faster growth and sacrifice a little bit of margin, we'd look at that. But life doesn't present those neat dichotomies. A lot of what we look at is -- are acquisitions that we think at least won't be dilutive to our margins when we run across businesses that we think have good growth prospects. And I'd point to SurePayroll as an example of that, where when we initially bought it, it was dilutive to margins, and now, it's catching up to our margins. If we have a chance to improve the margins, then we'll take a bet early on to get something that will improve growth and help us to improve -- and we can improve their margins over time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Siva Borra (Analysts)】\n[indiscernible] asking a question on [indiscernible] the margins you're getting from the solutions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThe margins that we're getting from Advance Partners? Yes, I'd just say, if I heard your question correctly, they're, on an EBITDA basis, pretty close to Paychex corporate margins.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rayna Kumar (Analysts)】\nThis is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Could you just walk us through the largest drivers to your 80 basis points operating margin expansion this quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nOh, this quarter. I would say a lot of that was -- I would say it was primarily driven by lower operating expense in the quarter. So we went into the quarter with a certain expectation around what we needed in terms of operating expenses, came out of it a little bit lighter than we anticipated. That's really the primary driver.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rayna Kumar (Analysts)】\nGot it. Could you quantify net price increases that you're realizing in both payroll and HR Services this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI won't go any further than calling out what we typically say that on payroll, we're getting a 2% to 4% price increase, where you can assume that it's in that range. We don't typically call out HRS because it varies year-to-year. So we're getting some price increase. It's not certainly as good as I mentioned on the call as what we got last year. The other thing I would say, too, Rayna, is one of the things that's occurring, particularly on the payroll side, is with the sales force able to sell more full-featured packages, especially under 50, you get some mix benefit, too. So all of those things help our revenue per client picture.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nEfrain, you talked a little bit about Advance Partners. Is this an acquisition or an industry that you think you have to build scale to really benefit from this? Or is this you'd like to see what you have and then determine if you want to take the next step about [ph] further consolidating?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think if you mean by consolidating, acquiring more, I think -- I mean, we feel good that this was a really good fit for us. As Efrain mentioned, we've got a big pipeline that we look at. And as we looked at this company, here they are outsourcing support, payroll, fund -- and funding support to small and midsized staffing companies like 7,500 staffing companies, placing 200,000 temps a year. This is a nice business that -- there's a number of -- there's a few businesses that do this, but nobody as much, I think, to this scale, and have done it very thoughtfully over the years. I think as we look at the business, we've got clients with staffing companies that I think are great opportunities for the funding side of the business for them. And I think we've got a lot of product that we could offer to their clients. I think this is a good fit. We're going to see how this goes and -- but we're always looking to say, hey, if it makes sense both from our standpoint and from theirs as well, from their leadership, I think there may be some consolidation efforts that are available out there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nMarty, I know that this is a fairly small acquisition compared to the overall Paychex, but does this change the risk profile? Does this acquisition change the risk profile of the acquisitions you've looked at and the -- compared to the acquisitions you've looked at in the past?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI don't think so. I think we're always looking for -- as Efrain said, this has got a good, strong margin to it that's close to ours. It's got a nice solid -- it has nice, solid growth. I don't think it really changes the risk profile much. I think one of the great things that they did, frankly, was had very good risk policies and procedures to be sure. This is a bit of a trickier business to be sure you're handling the right risk and you're taking on the right risk, and they've just done a remarkable job. And I think with our risk team, our risk management team working with them, I think we can help that even more with more tools and more information. So I don't think it really changes the risk profile at all.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nAnd then Efrain, on the float portfolio, one, any changes you're going to make as it seems as though the Fed is probably going to continue increasing rates. And two, is -- then is 25 basis points, about $2 million to net income, is that the right way to look at it on an annual basis? Or is there something different this time around that might mute the increase you would get in net income from rate increases?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nOkay. 2 good questions. So Kartik, the simple answer is that it depends on the shape of the yield curve. And if the yield curve steepens, then you have one portfolio strategy approach. And if the yield curve stays relatively flat, you have another. So we look at that in the spring, so that's why I can't say definitively, hey, this is what it'll look like in '17. In addition, I'd like to see if the Fed does do something in the spring, it will certainly aid the portfolio. The question is how much and how we configure the portfolio. On the $2 million, yes, I don't think that's that far off, Kartik. The only trick and reason why I call out $1 million is that, number one, we don't really expect to see too much benefit except through -- or I'm sorry, until sometime in January. It's not the best timing because our balances increase significantly in December and beginning of January. By that time, we'll be past the peak of our balances, so we don't get quite as much. By the time you're talking February before we start to see a lot of the -- some of the benefits. You don't have that many months left in the year. So that's part of what's guiding it. And the final thing I'd say is that if you're looking at, for example, money market rates and what banks are doing, the effects of the interest rate increase are really kind of slow rolling. They'll eventually get there, but it's kind of a slow roll at this point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nJust following up on that last one on rates. Did I hear you, right, you're not including in the guidance the $1 million benefit you think you'll get from the Fed hike? And if I did hear that right, why not?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, no. I guess what I was trying to say was that it doesn't alter the guidance significantly. I am calling it out. It's about $1 million. It just doesn't change significantly kind of where we're at in terms of the guidance on interest rates.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nGot you, okay. And I know you don't assume any future increases, but if -- in the guidance, but if the Fed did do what the Fed folks say, which is in next calendar year at 1.375%, I understand that it depends on the shape of the yield curve. But you do have about half the float in overnight stuff that will revalue pretty quickly, so we could start to see that really benefit if they do go through with that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, yes. Hey, look, you're right, Gary. That's absolutely right. I'm not trying to be excessively conservative. I, obviously, am somewhat gun shy to tell people we think that, that's exactly what's going to happen. I'll tell you I'll be the happiest person around if that's where we end up. I am extremely hopeful. But you're right. That's exactly what would happen, that would ripple through the short-term portfolio and have a pretty significant impact on the stock.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nOkay, good. I think the way you do it makes sense. And then just one question on sort of ACA-driven demand. I know in the last few years, HRS has been real strong as you've had sort of a broad halo effect. More customers are interested in considering their options in Europe, trusted source they'd turn to. But is -- should we think of the ACA compliance offering as having been a significant part of bookings and something that could drive some real acceleration in calendar '16? Or should we think -- because I know ADP has talked that way. Equifax, even with their ACA compliance, have seen just massive bookings growth? Or should we think that within the broader HRS portfolio, it's certainly a positive factor, but just one of many and more steady-as-she-goes continued strong growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think it's -- I think I'd say steady-as-she-goes on HRS growth. I think it certainly is helping. I think it still remains to be seen after the first filing date kind of where clients fall out, and in this, are they going to stay with it? Are they -- are more clients going to come in? I think some will fall out that probably will say, hey, I didn't need it. And I think others will say, I should've had it, and will add. So I think we'll still have good sales with ESR, the ACA product, through '16 kind of calendar year, because I think some things will fall out -- I think some clients will fall out and realize they should have had the product and didn't and then didn't file, because we're already getting calls like that now, like, hey, what do I do and it's a little bit late to gather all that information. So I think it's a little bit early, but it's very positive. We've seen great acceptance of the product. And frankly, as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we've had to ramp up some costs in the quarter to kind of handle all of the inflow of data and everything that clients are giving us. So I think it'll still be a positive right through the calendar year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then just one quick one. As you add on these incremental components to the Flex offering, is -- should we think of it as a material revenue opportunity to have existing customers sort of turn those on? Or is there more of a sales effort that'll take some time to drive that incremental revenue if you add these important components?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. Sure. I think it'll take a little bit of time, I think. We kind of make sure that we're bringing the clients along carefully. I mean, we're paying close attention. Now the operations team and the client retention teams talking to those clients realize there's a net benefit then we make the sale of the additional products and turn on those additional modules. The best -- the biggest benefit is when you're selling the entire product combined to the new clients, but we are certainly going back and marketing to the base that you now have available more modules that you can turn on. So I think there's certainly an opportunity there, but we're not going to rush it and kind of blitz the base. We're kind of letting the clients get comfortable with Flex and then show them that there's additional modules, which will help not only sales but retention more importantly as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Macdonald (Analysts)】\nA couple follow-ups. On Advance Partners, you talked about a 1.7 -- 1.5% increase in the HRS side from that, eventually, what categories is that in? Are those categories new to you like the financing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, yes, it's other. That's primarily the financing part of the business. So it would be HRS other, we'll have to figure out longer-term kind of where it goes. The other part, just to anticipate a question someone will ask, the other part is payroll services. The business is split pretty evenly between the 2.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Macdonald (Analysts)】\nOkay. And Marty mentioned that MMS is growing strongly now. Besides the obvious competitors, is that coming from any other sources? An expansion of the market? Or just where do you think that's coming from?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think there are some expansion in the fact that, as we've talked about, the need for the total product set has come down. So I think there's more clients in that 50-plus maybe 50 to 150 employees that are needing more product and more services and they're out. They may have been on an in-house solution and that was more -- much more simple and they needed more, they needed time and attendance. They needed HR administration. They needed benefits admin -- administration. So I think that though -- I do think the market is expanding a bit in the fact of who needs the complete suite of services, which has been positive. But I also think obviously we're taking share from some competitors as well, even though there's more competitors kind of out there and talking about things, I think you've seen a little bit more share we're taking now as we have a complete product set, HCM suite of cloud-based SaaS services.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nJust wanted to clarify a couple of things. I guess, the comments on Advance, that revenue contribution of 1 point to payroll, 1.5 point to HRS, that's for the 6 months left in the fiscal year? Is that the right way to think about it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThat's correct, Tim. Yes, [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nYou'll only have it for 5. So if we're thinking about the quarterly run rate, it's quarterly contribution, I guess, in a full quarter, it's higher than that so?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, yes. It would be. So yes, assuming we close this month which we, in all likelihood, will do, we expect to close shortly. Yes, you'd have 2 months in Q3 and then 3 months in Q4.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nOkay. Did you quantify the size of the purchase price I guess, we'll see it in the [indiscernible] eventually.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNo, you'll see it. You'll see it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nOkay. And the comment about retirement, about pricing, I guess, I wasn't clear exactly. Is the comment just you are taking less price than you did a year ago, so the growth rate is lower or it's a -- it wasn't a one-time bump last year that was a one-time revenue source I guess?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nWe review pricing along all of our businesses and periodically, and HRS in particular, don't necessarily, in a given year, increase price but may increase it. So.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nDid you see some sort of client pushback that -- why you took -- didn't take price again this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNo, no. We just -- we try to figure out what -- we do a lot of work on pricing to figure out what makes sense so we don't end up having an attrition or retention problem.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Eskelsen (Analysts)】\nI guess, the first one, just on the minimum premium plan, on the PEO. You had it in a place now for over a year, just wondering if you could sort of talk about the success that you've seen there? If you have any plans to extend it further? And then any impact on the risk in the PEO book?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think, no, we've done a good job on the risk as we handle that very carefully. And I think the sales and the risk management team there have worked very well together, which is what we expect and they've done a good job. I think it's been very successful. I think it's fairly limited to the area, but it's done well. And I think we're always looking at ways to expand it if that opportunity presents itself. And so we're very open to doing that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Eskelsen (Analysts)】\nAnd then just following up, wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the margins again? Can you just remind us sort of what your investment plans are for areas like IT? I think you had talked about in the past, now, it's sort of growing in line with revenue, is that the right...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nIt's took on a little faster than revenue. It probably will continue to grow a little bit faster than revenue. It just was growing at significantly higher than revenue growth. So I think it's moderated a bit. But I think if you're in the technology-enabled services business, tech spending is going to outpace revenue growth, at least over the intermediate term. It will do that for us and that's just the price of being in the business. And we have to -- we look at other ways to leverage the business to ensure that we deliver the bottom line.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Eskelsen (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just the last question. Just sort of philosophically here with the Advance Partners acquisition, just wondering how much of it was interest in adding more capabilities in the staffing market, more in line with the stuff that you already do? And how much of it was getting some of the funding stuff, so it's sort of expanding your services? And in future acquisitions, how much to either of those 2 -- bulking up the existing versus expanding into new plan to it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, it's an interesting -- I think it's a little bit of both. I mean always -- we're looking for -- to drive top line growth and continue to leverage and being a very profitable company, it makes the M&A very tight, the selection very tight, and get it at a very valuable -- a good value. So I think it's a little bit of both. I think we can expand -- what we saw was a great opportunity, just as you said it take what their products are and expanded it to a number of clients that we have that are staffing firms, small to mid-size staffing firms. And we think that's an immediate benefit. And then also, adding more, not only product to what they're offering, but the access to capital. This business needs capital -- access to capital to be able to continue to grow the funding business and we certainly have that, not only in cash, but in access to more capital besides. So we think between the 2 of them, we can accelerate their growth, and therefore, our growth, and do it at a very profitable way to do it. So this was the perfect fit for us and it's very much focused on that small to mid-sized staffing firm, which there's thousands, 10,000 of them. And I think they had a very decent market share, but still a lot of room to grow. So very good. And we think that temporary staffing business, frankly, is going to continue to grow. We're seeing part-time employment has grown almost 2 -- almost 3 percentage points in the last 2 years. So we think that with overtime rules, ACA and a number of other requirements, the staffing business and temporary employee business is going to continue to grow, we want to be part of it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThe gig economy is here to stay.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Macdonald (Analysts)】\nLast week, when Congress signed the year-end budget bill, there were a number of so-called tax extenders that were extended over longer time periods than they usually are. I know one of your competitors went out trumpeting one them specifically the WOTC, the work opportunity tax credit. Is that something you think it'll be an advantage to you? Are there any other items that were in there that might be something to help us spur business going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think just generally, all of those, they all encourage or they tend to encourage, most of them investment, new business startups and existing businesses to invest more in their business and to give some tax benefit for that. I think that's all positive, it all makes the economy stronger. I think the fact that if those had expired, I think, would've dampened the investment in -- particularly in small to mid-sized businesses. So I think they're all positive. I don't think there was anyone that would stand out to us to be that big of a benefit. But they certainly are all positive for the overall business environment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nAll right. That's helpful. And Efrain, I'm apologizing in advance, I've got another interest rate question for you. You mentioned, I think, you were going to relook at the strategy in the spring. Is that because you're just doing planning for next year or you're anticipating interest rate increases coming in the spring?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI think it's both, Jeff. So the -- how you configure the portfolio, not to go into a long digression here, I won't bore you, but what ADP did -- does is different than what we do. They borrow short term, they invest long term. We don't do that to a significant extent. We just haven't seen the value-add in recent years to do that. But the shape of the yield curve really has a big impact on whether you do that or you don't do that. And so we're a little bit in wait and see. We think the -- our internal betting is that the Fed will probably raise again in the spring. And then it'll start to become a little bit more clear to us what the shape of that yield curve is going to be so we can plan into '17. So it's a little bit of both.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ashwin Shirvaikar (Analysts)】\nSo I just wanted to start off with a clarification question with the -- with the guidance being what it is. It does include a few months of Advance. It does include the modest impact of higher interest rates. What you're really saying is that neither of those factors, taken together, is enough to change your guidance profile but they're still included in there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThat's correct, Ashwin. That's the point. So we could characterize it in a number of different ways. But the guidance ranges that we give, even with all of those changes at this point, we don't anticipate significant change from what we said at the beginning of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ashwin Shirvaikar (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then conceptually, as your sales force sells a wider range of products, so you kind of include Advance in there, for example, and it's a more complex offering, that makes sense in terms of revenue per client. But as you try to manage that, what specifically is the forward risk profile associated with payroll funding, which frankly it's not a -- not an end market that I fully understand yet. And does that mean a need for more sales force training, more expense in that area?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I think that one, Ashwin, that it will be sold by a specific sales force. It may be referred and it very much will be referred by the broader sales force. But that sale is very specific to -- and something that Advance has done a very good job on is having highly trained sales reps who bring a proper risk client -- risk profile client to them, then it goes through underwriting as well. So that's why I think they've done a very good job on risk. So it won't have to -- we won't have to train our entire sales force. We'll look for them-- we'll train them on the opportunity and the product, but just to get the referral to the other -- to a specific sales force that will evaluate the risk profile of the opportunity and then bring it to underwriting.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThe other thing, Ashwin, is that we liked about the business was that as I said, approximately half of what they sell are services that we're very, very, very familiar with. So they are selling payroll and outsourcing services. But in a particular vertical, which happens to be these staffing firms. So the profile really is not significantly different other than the funding piece of it that we think they do exceptionally well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ashwin Shirvaikar (Analysts)】\nGot it. And I apologize if this was asked, but I have to hop off for just a brief bit, the push-out of certain elements of ACA, Cadillac tax specifically, is that -- I mean, how are you thinking about that for your specific client base, does it have an impact?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI don't think that one has an impact. And very much in our small to mid-size businesses. I don't think you usually -- they won't normally run into that issue. So I don't think it will. It's -- I do think it's going to be a very interesting, still, year -- calendar year ahead of us in '16 for the Affordable Care Act products. Right now, as I said -- I did mention this earlier, that the demand has been very strong, and in fact, we've added some expense to support all that inflow of data from clients. And I think that the sales will kind of, some clients may say hey, after the filing date, I don't always need this. I don't need this product. Others will realize that they did need it and there'll be another kind of surge in sales I think in '16. So I think the sales will still continue to be pretty strong in calendar year '16.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ashwin Shirvaikar (Analysts)】\nGot it. My last question really is -- and this is potentially a few months too early. But do you worry about the interest-rate sensitivity, obviously, higher interest rates is good for you, but interest-rate sensitivity of your client base? I mean, do they care, I was just looking at one of your shared payroll service which applies to a piece of your client base, 45% of clients don't care but that means 55% do care. Any thoughts there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think -- first of all, for new business, small businesses and those who are starting up typically don't go through a bank for their credit anyway. So I don't think there'll be too impacted by a number of increases that -- until it gets much higher. So I don't think we're going to see a big impact on small business to start. They usually use other funding sources and so forth. So I don't think a big impact there. I think mid-size businesses that are more capital-intensive, that need to borrow, will see some impact as the rates start to go up, but in the near future it's hard to anticipate that they're going to up enough to drive that much impact to them, Efrain?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI'd agree.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Keane (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of follow-up questions. Have you guys thought about using your balance sheet more to do small business lending?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWe've thought about it. There's -- it's a pretty crowded space out there with a number of companies out there doing it. And we have -- we continue to look at that as an opportunity. We are -- we have some partnership with the Vista Credit and do some referrals with them. But we've continued to look at the business as well. But it's a pretty crowded space these days.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Keane (Analysts)】\nYes, yes. You guys just have pretty good access to financials. So you would have a pretty good idea of good and bad loan potential, so I thought it would be kind of an interesting option.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, we have watched it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Keane (Analysts)】\nI just want to ask about retention going into the big selling season. How do you guys feel about retention going forward coming into the selling season here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. Pretty good. So far at this point, we're feeling good. When we talked earlier about a price increase and we held our price increase. We've held the increase well and our retention is near its historic best. And so it's early because you really get that best sense at the end of December and into January, but at this point, we feel good about it. Our retention's continuing to hold.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Keane (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then can you quantify -- you talked about sales growth being double digits and ahead of plan, can you quantify how much ahead of plan that is?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNo, but it's strong. I would just say this, Bryan. So I called out higher sales expenses which I typically don't do, because we've got a range and, frankly, The Street can figure out what that range is. But I would say, through the first 6 months, when we were preparing for the call, we had a discussion about whether to call it out. Because some quarters, you have better sales growth than you have -- than others, but given the strength of what we've seen in the back 6 months and in our planning process, we thought we had to out add to selling expense because they are off to a very strong start. So it's strong by our standards. Yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Keane (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then the common question were going to get on that is how does that translate, that strong sales, the double digits, into revenue growth, maybe just remind his, Efrain, best way to think about that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. Typically, you're not seeing that sales growth probably for another 4 to 6 months going forward. So there is a bit of a lag. Some of it, you see as soon as 2 to 3 months, some of it, a little bit longer cycle because you have to set clients up. So you start to see that translating into '17 sales.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sara Gubins (Analysts)】\nSo a question first on ACA. How did the adoption of the compliance product trend during the second quarter, and I guess what I'm wondering is you'd talked about being at about 50% adoption last quarter and that had been up from 25% to 33% in the prior quarter, so I'm wondering kind of what the penetration is looking like?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI think it's a little bit higher than that, Sara, but not dramatically higher. We never thought that we'd get 100% adoption in the base because there are other solutions out there. So I think we're trending above -- certainly, above 50%. But it's not 100%, and we don't anticipate that it will be.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sara Gubins (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then a quick question on Advance Partners. How cyclical has their business been in the past given the end market?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, not very. I mean, obviously, I guess, there's countercurrents. I haven't looked at where they were in '08 or '09. But they've had a pretty steady track record of growth. You can argue that when things take a downturn you actually have slightly increased demand for temporary versus full-time employees. So -- but their growth pattern has been pretty steady. That was one of the things that we looked at.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sara Gubins (Analysts)】\nOkay. Maybe they were taking good share in the last downturn.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nIt could. In any event, it could.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sara Gubins (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, so you talked about sales expense being higher. Did you change the plans for sales headcount growth. I think you had talked about 3% this fiscal year versus 4% to 5% last year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNo, no. Yes, no we didn't -- I mean, whatever we said at the beginning of the year is still holding. We're above in sales heads particularly on the payroll side. So that's true. When we call out higher sale expense, it's not headcount, it's because our sales are variable. And so if we anticipate that sales is going to have a good selling season, which is what we believe will happen. And we rarely, rarely talk about it that way. We're a little bit more cautious, then we just bump expenses. And so right now, The Street models that I've seen in third quarter are not taking into account that selling expense. So.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nSo just as a follow-up on that, the sales expense is up not because of headcount but because of better performance. It takes about 4 to 6 months. If it's up double digits, then what sort of incremental bump does that do to revenue relative to a steady-state?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. I guess, Mark, I won't go through the arithmetic, but I think the thing always to remember is that our revenue retention average is about 86%. So you get a little bit of effect this year and then you get the rest of it next year. In order for you -- when people ask me this question, in order for you to start accelerating up to double digits, you'd have really have a period of -- a multiyear period of very strong sales performance. Now we hope we're somewhat on that trend. But you need more than one to make it occur. That's part A. Part B of the explanation, which is going to lead me to part C. Part B is simply to say that sales is one component of the equation. Obviously, retention is the other component of the equation and how the pieces of that fit together when we put together a plan tells me where sales growth is going to go. You have seen that in the last 3 years, certainly, even excluding the impacts of the minimum premium plan. We've seen revenue bump up because sales, the leading indicator, has been growing. So C is simply that I'll have to get to '17 when I give you guidance. But I think we feel good. If we see this kind of sales growth continue through the year, that's going to be a positive for next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nYes, so all other things being equal, I mean, we should end up seeing total services revenue accelerate slightly, at least.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI would say, if we continue with this strong performance, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then how much -- can you just remind us what the ACA ERS is adding in terms of revenue?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nWe don't disclose it. It's -- what's tricky about that is if I were to give you a number, I'd have to say also then that ESR cuts both ways in that it represents an opportunity for additional sales, but it's also other sales that we might not get because people are focused on selling it. And there's a tremendous amount of demand. So it's buried in the HRS number and that's about as far as we'll go.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nOkay. And is all of advanced on HRS?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNo, no. That's -- Mark, so I called out very carefully the balance of the year, I think to [indiscernible] earlier. So I called out a 1% increase for the balance of year on payroll service revenue and 1.5% on HRS for the balance of the year. Balance of the year is 10 -- I mentioned earlier, is about 5 months or so that we expect. So no, actually the business is evenly split between Payroll Services, what we would consider Payroll Services revenue, and funding, which we're going to lump into HRS for now until we figure out where a better category is for.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nGreat. And Advance is growing double digits?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, they are. And strongly profitable.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nYes. And so the pipeline that you mentioned, I mean, how rare is it to see something that's reasonably priced, growing at a decent rate and as profitable as you are?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWell, when we disclose the cash flows you guys can determine, I should say you guys, but you can determine how reasonable the price is, but we thought it was a reasonable price for the prospects of the business. It is fairly rare, I would say that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nOkay. Any thoughts with regards to sales headcount going into next year? How are you thinking about trending that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I would think, Mark, it would be consistent. I mean, we're depending on which area and so forth, we're just kind of getting into studying that now, and it will actually after selling season. But I think we would continue to probably increase a little bit more. You may see a little bit more virtual because that's where we've seen more of the growth in the last few years. But they're still -- field resources would continue to go up as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then one last question, just on the International front, whether you are thinking about Germany or Brazil, any updates there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nGermany is continued to, I think, do well. The client base is really getting up there. Performance is -- so sales performance is good and retention is very good, so I think we're doing well there. And Brazil has just been slower than we expected. A number of things have changed, the economy's not as strong. There's some political stuff going on and the legislation that we expected, that would be more of a disruptor, which was requiring more electronic filing for small businesses, has been delayed now for a couple of years. We expect it to still get done, but it's taking longer. So that disruption to drive more payroll from accountants into a third party has been slower, much slower to happen than we expected.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI'd say the other thing, Mark, just to build on what Marty said, we remain interested in building out the international portion of the business, and M&A is also focused on looking at those opportunities, too.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Ellis (Analysts)】\nI have a question, you've talked for a couple new quarters now about the transition to this bundled selling approach out in the field. Can you give an idea within HRS, parse a little bit the relative growth rates of the ancillary services and how they've been impacted by that bundled selling approach versus the ASO PEO piece of HRS?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWe don't really break it down to that level, but it definitely has helped our attachment rate at the beginning of the sale. Our old approach was, hey, we'll sell payroll -- this is particularly to small businesses, we'll sell you payroll and then come back with different sales forces. And this team selling now at the 20 employee or so size has really gone much, much better. It's still early in the process, but were seeing nice results for the clients. Not only is it we're selling more of a complete bundle, but also the clients have a -- they're happier because they weren't looking for just payroll, they were looking for more and we're being able to satisfy them the right way, I think, upfront but we don't really break it down much more than that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Ellis (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then the second one is Flex-related. You mentioned that, that -- I think you mentioned that, that is appealing to a more of a mid-market client. Can you give an idea of what size of client you're seeing sort of a new uptick in, in terms of demand, and I guess any other kind of changes or differences you're noticing about Flex?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, first of all, as Efrain said, the majority of the clients are on Flex. What I should say is the mid-market, that 50-plus are -- it's more interested in the full bundle, the suite of -- complete suite of products. So Flex can be payroll only. It can be a complete bundle of services. And we're seeing bigger uptake in the bundle for those, probably even 20 and above, because that need has come down. So I think it's just time and attendance, for example. In the past, you'd be at a pretty good-size -- necessarily an employee size before you'd be interested in time and attendance. Now with overtime rules, Affordable Care Act, and also, by the way, the technology of time and attendance, there's just a much greater need for it. Clients want it. It's easier. You can do it on your mobile app. Now clients get -- client employees can punch in and out on their phone. So there's -- we've -- I think the need has driven down in size and the technology and our breadth of products and mobility has made it a lot easier for clients to incorporate it into their businesses. So I think the impact there is that the majority of clients are on Flex and the 20-plus, 30-plus employee clients are taking much more of a full suite or some portion of that suite of products.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nI headed [ph] for a minute, so if this has been answered it, we can take these offline but I just had a couple of very quick follow-ups. So the first is, I think your commentary implied that your checks for clients were relatively flat, and can you remind us is -- is that a function of where we are in the cycle? Or is there something else driving that metric?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. So David, if you look at our average client size, we're bouncing around 17 or so. And it's really nothing more than the fact that under 50, we're -- we were having a lot of -- a lot more growth than we were in previous years. And you have a tendency there -- that has a tendency to depress the number of checks per client. If I same-store it, you're at somewhere between 0 to 1%. So because checks per client are not really a significant contributor, we really just don't call it out. So that's basically the dynamic of what's occurring. As you grow that, you tend to see that impact.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nRight. I guess I was just trying to reconcile that with your commentary about some of the growth momentum in your new bookings as being driven by MMS.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nGood point. And I think that's a fair point, it's early in the cycle. So if in the end, we were to start skewing higher then you would see that pop-up. But it's going to take a little bit of time before you start to see that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nAll right. And then the second question I had was on HRS. I think I understand the impact of the retirement services, pricing action, however, what, if anything, may be going on in the underlying PEO business, just curious what the trends are in that business relative to where they've been, because they've been relatively strong I think we can [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, they're still very, very strong. So just to remind you what's buried or not buried, what's included in HRS. So you got Insurance services, you got HR Outsourcing. You have retirement services. And you have actually online services. And I'll just remind everyone that when we had the Investor Day, I said we really need to kind of think about how we represent payroll services going forward, because it really doesn't capture the activity that's going on in that segment of revenue. Having said all of that, PEO still is relatively small as a percentage of revenue for the company as a whole and even within HRS. It's still, certainly, well south of 50%. But it's growing very, very rapidly, faster -- much faster than HRS is growing as a whole.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think it's still -- it's a very strong market for the product, particularly, with the Affordable Care Act and the need for HR -- more HR because of the regulations and so forth. So yes, it continues to be very strong demand.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nAll right. So no -- to the takeaway, there's no change in trajectory of that business despite the growth rate of the category?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNo, we feel pretty optimistic about that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just one final question. I guess, there have been several questions about the bookings momentum that you're reporting. Can you help us -- I mean, you called out MMS as being a component of that momentum. But is there anything else in there in terms of mix, whether it be a fully outsourced solution versus not, you cited revenue per client going up with more modules being purchased. But just curious if there's any kind of new trend emerging that may be driving that metric up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nWell, I think, obviously, employee shared responsibility helps too, so that's part of the equation there. But if I look at all of the different sales forces and the products that they sell, the combined effect is really strong. We don't have sales forces that -- we don't have any that are performing under where we expect. So we've got a lot of cylinders hitting all at once. So.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think the mid-market is the strongest, if you looked at that. That's been the biggest, strong, and PEO and HR outsourcing have been particularly strong, as Efrain has mentioned. So I think overall though, is we've seen nice growth in all of the sales forces, nice par growth. But the leaders have been, at this stage, the mid-market. And they have a -- remember, they have a much fuller product suite now, and 2 components just -- were just added, fully integrated. And so they are selling a higher revenue per client. And their success is up. So...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tien-Tsin Huang (Analysts)】\nJust want to ask on PEO demand as we cross into the new calendar year. Any change in your thinking around global demand, in general, for PEO?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nNo, it has continued to be strong. And selling season will kind of tell the tale here, but it continues to be very strong, and frankly, has picked up in some parts of the country where we've added more reps, where we were not selling as much PEO. So no, I think the demand there is still good and looks sustainable.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tien-Tsin Huang (Analysts)】\nOkay, good. Just one more, just on the HRS side, I know we always sweat rounding and whatnot, but I think you mentioned that it was going to fall below the 10% to 13% range. I mean, are we talking about a rounding to 9% kind of issue? Or is it going to be much different from that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThanks, Tien-tsin, for asking the question everyone's figuring out. So yes, we're -- we anticipate somewhere in that 9% range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tien-Tsin Huang (Analysts)】\nOkay, like I said [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNo, no, short question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Glenn Greene (Analysts)】\nJust 2 questions and clarifications. The first one is sort of the bookings momentum commentary. If I recall, the kind of the last couple of quarters have been strong as well. So is it -- did we accelerate in terms of booking momentum? Or is this more just sort of sustainable trends we've seen over the last few quarters? Just sort of how you would characterize that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think it's sustained. I think it's up a little stronger, practically in the mid-market. But it's sustained double-digit for the last, at least the last few quarters. So I'd say, it's up a little bit, but it's certainly, and that's a good thing it's not like it popped up one quarter and then it slowed down. We've seen some nice momentum going into the selling season here.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Glenn Greene (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just to clarify, Efrain, on Advance Partners. You sort of in your prepared comments, you said it was excluded from the guidance, and then I think in a response to a question, said included in guidance. It may be just a nuance, but maybe the answer is just that it doesn't move the needle enough. But I kind of just want to check my math that it's like 60 basis points to growth and 120 basis points in the back half.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, Glenn. So what I was trying to do was carefully parse 2 things. First, tell you what growth looked like before I added in Advance Partners, right? So I talked about that. And then after I did that, I said, okay, after you've gotten that right, because you got to get your models right, then what does -- what will Advance include when it is closed? So that's when I said in the balance of the year, whatever your models say based on what I guided you to, you're going to get about 1% in the balance of the year for payroll service revenue growth and 1.5% for HRS growth in the balance of the year. And it was clarified that, that's probably going to be about 5 months or so. So I just was trying to say the overlay of Advance looks like that. When you put all that together with guidance we've given for the year, we're still overall within the range of guidance that we provided for the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Glenn Greene (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just a quick math on a full-year run rate, something like $35 million of revenue, is that reasonable?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI see where your math works, and I can't disagree with it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nOkay, I think that's all the questions. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived until approximately January 22. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our second quarter press release conference call, and for your interest in Paychex. We very much appreciate that. We wish you all a very happy, happy holiday season. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Brandi. Good morning to everyone. This morning's press release reviews our first quarter of fiscal 2016 operating results for the 12 weeks ended November 22. Before I begin, please note that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. \r\nTo begin with our 12-week first quarter of fiscal 2016. For the quarter, our reported earnings per share came in at $1.09, $0.03 below last year's reported figure of $1.12. \r\nThere are several items of note, 6 to be exact, that impacted this year-over-year comparison of Q1 earnings. First, FX. In first quarter, the foreign currencies where we operate were weaker year-over-year versus the U.S. dollar, primarily in Canada, Mexico and Korea, such that foreign earnings in Q1, when converted into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, were lower by approximately $42 million or $0.10 a share than those earnings would have been had the FX exchange rates been flat year-over-year. The big weaknesses started about a year ago. While I certainly don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, and there's been continued weakness, certainly, the biggest impacts look like the last 4 quarters. One of the benefits, of course, is it's made purchasing land and building units in some of these countries a little cheaper over the last year. \r\nNumber two, stock compensation expense was $36 million higher year-over-year in the first quarter or $0.05 a share. We have over 4,600 people in our -- who receive restricted stock units. For many of them, it is a significant part of their annual compensation. These grants are made annually each October in our fiscal first quarter. While these grants typically vest over a 5-year period, accelerated vesting occurs when a recipient reaches 25, 30 and 35 years of employment with the company. So factors driving this $36 million increase included additional levels of accelerated vesting given the rising number of employees achieving long tenure with the company. This, by the way, is most impactful each Q1, given our October RSU grant cycle; two, appreciation in our stock price, and of course, the larger number of employees in the plan. I'd like to note that because of the significant price appreciation in our stock this past year, this year's annual RSU grant, which occurred in late October, was reduced by an average of 12%. That is the number of RSUs granted to each recipient. So while there was a $36 million year-over-year increase in Q1, in the upcoming second, third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year, the anticipated year-over-year increases are estimated to be about 1/3 of this dollar amount in each of the fiscal quarters. So $0.01 to $0.02 earnings year-over-year impact each quarter in second, third and fourth quarters versus the $0.05 a share impact in Q1. \r\nThird point I'd like to note, there are 2 SG&A items that together, negatively impacted this year's Q1 earnings. In the first quarter, we recorded a $22 million charge related to 2 nonrecurring legal and regulatory matters. The $22 million figure represented an 8 basis point hit to SG&A and impacted our first quarter earnings per share by $0.04. \r\nPoint number four, IT modernization. As discussed in each of the past many quarters over a couple of years now, our major IT modernization efforts continue to impact our SG&A expense percentages, especially as new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. In the first quarter, on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs have impacted SG&A by an estimated $20 million pretax or 7 basis points -- 6 basis points without gas deflation, which is about a $0.03 hit to earnings in the quarter versus last year. \r\nPoint number five. Last year in the first quarter, we did call out that we had a $17 million benefit to gross margin related to a nonrecurring legal settlement. So that benefited last year's first quarter by $0.03 a share. \r\nAnd lastly, point number six, our co-branded credit card transition in the U.S. As you know, we'll be transitioning to a new co-branded credit card relationship in the U.S. next year. As we wind down our current relationship, new co-brand sign-ups have greatly slowed, and in fact, are now for now ceased. The short-term negative impact relates to monies we earned for new co-brand sign-ups. Year-over-year in Q1, this represented a $15 million or a $0.02 per share hit to our earnings. This will continue to be a small negative impact to earnings in Qs 2 and 3 and possibly into Q4 based on timing, at which time I'll be able to better outline how the new relationship should directionally impact our future results and the future rewards to our members under the new co-branded credit card program. I look forward to sharing more information at that time. \r\nSo 6 items of note. I added it up, it's about $0.27 of impact to our year-over-year earnings comparison. I know many of these things you may have in your numbers. I know some of them, you don't. \r\nTurning to our first quarter sales. In terms of sales for the quarter, our 12-week reported comp sales figure for Q1 showed a minus 1% decrease, plus 2% in the U.S., minus 9% in Canada and minus 5% in Other International. As we stated in our release, if you take out the 2 big impacts of gas price deflation year-over-year and the impact of negative FX, the plus 2% reported U.S. comp would have been a plus 6% for the first quarter, the minus 9% in Canada would've been a plus 9%, and the minus 5% in Other International would have been a plus 7%, such that the minus 1% reported comp would've been a plus 6%. And as we reported last Wednesday in our November sales results for the 4-week month ended November 29, our comp sales increase, excluding the impact of FX and gas, was similar to the 12-week first fiscal quarter, with total company comp increase of 6% and again, ex gas and FX, in the U.S., a plus 6%; in Canada, a plus 8%; in Other International, a plus 7%. \r\nIn terms of opening activities and plans, we opened 13 new locations in Q1, including 2 relos, for a net of 11 new warehouses during the quarter, which ended November 22. That included 7 in the U.S.; 1 in Canada; 1 in Australia, our eighth in that country; 1 in Japan, our 24th in Japan; and our second in Spain just outside Madrid in Getafe. That's our second unit in Spain. Two relocated locations were in Woodland Hills, California and Teterboro, New Jersey. \r\nIn the second quarter, we had 2 new business centers planned to open, one each in Westminster, California and in Hackensack, New Jersey. And for all of fiscal '16, we have a current plan to open up 32 net new locations. That could come down a little bit based on timing as we get into the second half of the year. A few may be delayed, but that's our current plan. Of those, assuming we were able to do all 32, 22 of them would be in the U.S., 3 in Canada, 2 each in Japan and Australia and 1 each in the U.K., Taiwan and Spain. Later in the call, I will review with you our e-commerce activities, our membership trends, additional discussion about gross margin and SG&A in Q1 and recent stock purchase activities. \r\nAgain, very briefly, sales for the quarter reported were up 1.3% to $26.6 billion, up from $26.3 billion a year ago. Again, on a comp basis, reported number was down 1%, but ex gas and FX, was up 6%. For the quarter, our minus 1% reported comp sales results were a combination of an average transaction size down 4% for the quarter. Again, taking out gas and FX, it would be up 3%, excluding again those items, at an average shopping frequency of about 3.5% for the quarter. \r\nIn terms of sales comparisons by geography, geographically for Q1, the better operating performing regions in the U.S. were all 3 regions in California and the Midwest as well. Internationally, in local currencies, the better-performing countries were Australia, Taiwan, Mexico and Canada. \r\nIn terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, during the quarter, which we looked at September, October and November, excluding FX and gas, within food and sundries, which were up in the mid-single digits year-over-year, sundries, meat deli and spirits were the relative standouts. Our hardline sales were up in the mid- to high single digits for the quarter. Majors, or electronics, came in positive for the quarter in the low double-digit range. In addition to electronics, better-performing departments included hardware and garden/patio. Within the mid single digits, softline comps, domestics, women's apparel and home furnishings were standouts. And in fresh foods, where our comp sales were in the mid- to high single digits, our produce was at the top of the 4 subcategories. \r\nMoving down the line items on the income statement, membership fees. In the first quarter, membership fees were up 2% and 2 basis points, or up $11 million, coming in at $593 million versus $582 million a year ago. Again, without FX, the dollars would've been up 6%. I noticed in several of the preliminary notes from some of the sell-side analysts out there, they had expressed some questions about the strength in membership. And I might point out a couple of things. In addition to being up 6% ex FX, on a cash basis, there was about another percentage point higher than these numbers, as well anecdotally a year ago, we did a couple of things outside with social media, which we didn't do. Small impact year-over-year, but something versus nothing. \r\nIn terms of membership, we continue to benefit from good sign-ups in existing and new locations, continued increasing penetration of our $110 a year Executive Membership and strong renewal rates, 91%, averaging up to 91% in the U.S. and Canada and averaging up to 88% worldwide. Our new membership sign-ups in Q1 year-over-year company-wide were up 7%. In terms of members at Q1 end, Gold Star was -- came in at the quarter end at 34.7 million, up from 34.0 million at year-end; Primary Business, 7.2 million at quarter end versus 7.1 million a quarter ago. Business add-on remained at 3.5 million. So total memberships, 45.4 million at quarter end, up from 44.6 million and including extra cards, 82.7 million cards out there versus 81.3 million 12 weeks earlier. At Q1 end, paid Executive Memberships came in at 16.4 million, which was an increase of 307,000 or 26,000 new Executive members increased each week in the 12-week fiscal first quarter. As you know, Executive members are over 1/3 of our member base and over 2/3 of our sales in those countries where Executive Membership is available. \r\nIn terms of renewal rates, in the U.S. and Canada, at quarter end, we were at 90.6%, rounded up to 90.6%. We rounded down to 90.5% at the end of Q1. That's the impact that I mentioned a quarter ago at Canada with having to re-sign up the members with the new credit card program, the de novo program. That was a real small of an impact. I think there was a little impact to the U.S. perhaps, based on what I said earlier. Total worldwide remained at 87.8% at quarter end and at fiscal year-end. \r\nGoing down the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the quarter was up 26 basis points, coming in at 11.29%, up from 11.03%. As you know, gas deflation is a big impact to these figures so I'll give you a couple of numbers. I'll ask you to write down the normal 4 columns. For all of fiscal '15, columns 1 and 2 would be reported and then without gas deflation, and then 2 columns for Q1 '16, reported and without gas deflation. And of course, these basis points figures are the year-over-year change from a year ago. Merchandise core reported was plus 11 basis points for all of fiscal '15, but without gas deflation, was minus 12 year-over-year. For Q1, it was plus 24 and minus 3. Ancillary businesses for the year, plus 29 and plus 23; for the quarter, plus 11 and plus 4. 2% Reward, minus 4 and minus 2; and for the quarter, minus 3 and minus 1. LIFO for all of last year was a 5 basis point pickup, both for the reported and without deflation. And for the quarter, it was plus 1 and plus 1. Other, last -- for the whole, all of last year, plus 2 reported and plus 1 without gas deflation, and this year, that nonrecurring legal settlement impact to gross margin that benefited gross margin a year ago such that it was minus 7 basis points reported and minus 7 without gas deflation. You add up those columns for all of fiscal '15, reported gross margin was up 43 basis points, but up 15 ex gas deflation. This year, Q1 reported, up 26, but without gas deflation, minus 6, with minus 7 of that minus 6 being the onetime benefit a year ago. So again, overall, those are the numbers. \r\nIn terms of core gross margins, which is the core business, food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percent of their own sales, they were positive year-over-year in Q1 by 13 basis points and they were higher year-over-year across all 4 of these merchandise categories, but with both hardlines and softlines showing stronger year-over-year improvement than the year-over-year improvement in food, sundries and fresh foods. But nonetheless, all 4 were positive year-over-year. Ancillary and other business gross margin was up 11 on a reported basis, up 4 without gas deflation for the quarter. Many of these businesses, gas, pharmacy, food court, hearing aids and mini labs, all showed higher year-over-year gross margins as a percent of their own sales. Offsetting this a little was slightly lower e-commerce gross margins, but overall, net positive there. \r\nThe 2% Reward was higher year-over-year due to higher sales penetrations for Executive members. This impacted gross margin in Q1 by 3 basis points to the negative -- 1 basis point to the negative ex gas. \r\nLIFO, last year in Q1 we had a $2 million credit, representing slight deflation in the U.S. inventory pools, and a credit of $5 million this year, also relatively small but a net pickup of a basis point year-over-year in terms of that recovery. Lastly, I mentioned the quarterly adjustment, a 7 basis point hit in terms of the comparison benefiting a nonrecurring benefit last year versus nothing this year. So overall, gross margins, excluding gas, were down 6 basis points year-over-year but up 1 basis point, excluding that 1-year charge -- nonrecurring benefit from last year. \r\nMoving on to SG&A. Our SG&A percentages Q1 over Q1 were higher by 28 basis points, coming in at 10.54% this year versus 10.26% last year, but excluding gas deflation, were lower or better by 2 basis points. I'll go in some detail and you'll see that the core expense components of that actually were pretty good. So again, 4 columns: columns 1 and 2 would be fiscal '15, the year reported and without gas deflation, and then columns 3 and 4 would be Q1 '16 reported and without gas deflation. \r\nOur first line item, core operations, minus 6 reported and plus 16 without deflation for all of last year on a year-over-year basis; in Q1, 0 and plus 26. Central, minus 7 and minus 5 for the year and minus 8 and minus 6 for the quarter. Stock compensation, minus 5 and minus 4 for the year and minus 12 and minus 10 for the quarter. Quarterly adjustments, no, nothing last year in columns 1 and 2, this year minus 8 and minus 8, that represents that $22 million item that I mentioned early on. So in total, last year for the year-over-year we reported SG&A up or minus 18 basis points and without gas deflation, better or lower, so plus 7 basis points. This year, higher by 28, so minus 28 basis points for the quarter reported, and without deflation, plus 2. \r\nWithin operations, again, without deflation, showed plus 26 or lower by 26. Within that, our core warehouse payroll was better year-over-year in the mid- to high single digits. Benefits were lower, better in the high single digits, and the combination of other expenses, a variety of them, were better or lower by 10 basis points year-over-year. So again, kind of the core -- control or operating expenses were all in pretty good shape this quarter. Central expense was higher year-over-year by minus 8 or minus 6 basis points without gas. As I mentioned earlier in the call, increased IT spending related to modernization showed higher year-over-year costs of 7 basis points, 6 without gas deflation. \r\nI already mentioned the -- earlier, the stock compensation, which was 12 basis points or 10 basis points without deflation. I also mentioned that, again, because of, certainly, the stock price increase, but also, importantly, the fact that there's more and more employees hitting 25, and in some cases, 30, and even in a few cases, 35 if they started back at Price Club, the total impact for the year, more than half of it, based on our estimates, is the impact in Q1, with about 1/3 or less of that amount in each of the upcoming 3 quarters year-over-year. So still going to be higher year-over-year, but not as high as that increase was in Q1. \r\nFinally, quarterly adjustments, again, related to the $22 million nonrecurring legal and regulatory items that I discussed. So overall, good expense control, other -- with plenty of things, and hopefully, I've been able to elaborate, share, shed some light on the components of that. \r\nMoving down the income statement. Preopening expense was higher by $11 million or 4 basis points higher. We had 9 openings last year, including 1 relocation; 13 this year, including 2. There's other preopening items in terms of countries and some other things. But overall, no big surprises there. All told, reported operating income in Q1 was down $3 million from $770 million last year to $767 million this year. \r\nBelow operating income, reported interest expense in Q1 came in at $33 million versus $26 million a year ago, so higher by $7 million. Interest income -- no, I'm sorry, lower by $7 million. Interest income itself was lower year-over-year by about $4 million, and the other component was lower by $3 million year-over-year. That's primarily related to various FX-related transactions. Sometimes, that's a positive; sometimes, that's a negative; never that meaningful for the year in its entirety generally. Overall, reported pretax income was down 2% versus last year, coming in at $762 million, down from $779 million pretax a year ago. Again, several items impacted year-over-year earnings comparison, which I discussed earlier in the call. \r\nIn terms of tax rates, our corporate tax rate this quarter was up about a percentage point, coming in at 36.1% compared to last year's first quarter rate of 35.2%. The higher tax rate year-over-year resulted from a few discrete items going to the -- increasing tax rate, not reducing it. And to a little extent, lower earnings penetration from our foreign country operations, where tax rates are generally lower than our income tax rates for the United States. \r\nNow for a quick rundown of other topics. The balance sheet, as has been in the recent past, is included in today's press release. Point out a couple of items: Depreciation and amortization for Q1 came in at $271 million. Accounts payable as a percent of inventory on a reported basis was pretty much the same year-over-year. Last year was 101%, this year 100%. Taking out non-merchandise payables, last year, non-merchandise payables as a percent of inventories was 92%. This year at quarter end, it was 90%. Average inventory per warehouse on a reported basis was up a little over 3% or $524,000 to $14.9 million. Again, ex FX, it would have been up 6.5%, at $960,000, assuming flat FX. About $0.25 million is electronics and what we call majors, and about $160,000 is apparel. Both built up inventory heading into the Thanksgiving week, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. As you could have extrapolated from our November reporting, where we reported the 4 weeks of November, the 12-week first quarter and the 13-week retail reporting calendar, or 4-5-4, the implication there, of course, was that the last week, which is really the first week of Q2, which is Thanksgiving week, was pretty strong. \r\nThe balance of the departments have been selling well, like hardware, housewares and toys. So really no issues of inventory levels going into the last few weeks before calendar year-end. We're in pretty good shape. \r\nIn terms of CapEx, in Q1, we spent a little over $700 million and our estimate for the year is to be into -- most likely CapEx will be in the high 2s, say, $2.8 billion to $3 billion. This compares to CapEx of last fiscal year of $2.4 billion. \r\nIn terms of dividends, our quarterly dividend continues at $0.40 a share or $1.60 annualized. This represents a total annual cost to the company of around $700 million. In terms of stock buybacks in Q1, we bought back a total of 898,000 shares for $130 million, so an average price of $144.88. \r\nNext topic, Costco Online. We're now into 5 countries, having launched Korea November 10. We're in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Mexico and Korea. For the first quarter, sales and profits were up over last year. Q1 e-commerce total sales were up 15% on a comp basis, total and comp basis, up 19% on a comp basis excluding FX. And again, it represents a little over 3% of our sales. We've been asked a lot of how, again, the week of Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, you name it. E-commerce sales were quite strong, up 28% and up over 30% in local currencies. \r\nNew initiatives. Again, it was a few years ago that we re-platformed the sites. We've continued to improve our mobile apps, and there's room to go, but they're a lot better than they used to be. Combined some of our e-commerce merchandising efforts with our inline efforts. We've added a few categories, like apparel, HABA and KS items. We've greatly improved timing of shipments by shipping out of more than just one depot across the country. And again, we'll expect to see e-commerce in other international markets in the future. \r\nIn terms of some of the others out there that are buying from us, we continue to provide merchandise for sale on the Google Shopping Express. This is now being offered in 6 markets: The Bay Area has recently been expanded; L.A.; Manhattan; and more recently, Chicago, D.C. and Boston. We've increased our offerings and categories and are currently testing fresh foods available in a limited group in each of the San Francisco and L.A. markets. We're also providing merchandise to Instacart now in 16 markets through the rest of the United States; Boxed in 3 markets; and we're also selling -- doing some business with jet.com in the 3 cities where they have their distribution centers. \r\nOutside of here, Alibaba Tmall, we currently offer just over 200 SKUs on the Tmall site, with a heavy emphasis on Kirkland Signature items. It's going well and we're certainly building some recognition for the Costco and the Kirkland Signature names. We had a very successful Singles Day on Alibaba Tmall, receiving over 300,000 orders. \r\nNext on the discussion list, expansion. Again, last year, we opened net new units of 23, so about 3.5% square footage growth. This year, again, plans for up to 32 units. If we achieve that, it would be about 5% square footage growth, and I already mentioned where those would be. Also, as of Q1 end, some of you want to know what our square footage is.  At Q1 end, it stood at 100,547,000 square feet. \r\nLastly, our second quarter fiscal 2016 scheduled earnings release, that would be for the 12 weeks ended on February 14, will be after the market closes on Wednesday, March 2, with earnings the following morning on Thursday, March 3. \r\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Brandi, and be happy to open it up for questions. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nThank you, Brandi. Good morning to everyone. This morning's press release reviews our first quarter of fiscal 2016 operating results for the 12 weeks ended November 22. Before I begin, please note that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. \r\nTo begin with our 12-week first quarter of fiscal 2016. For the quarter, our reported earnings per share came in at $1.09, $0.03 below last year's reported figure of $1.12. \r\nThere are several items of note, 6 to be exact, that impacted this year-over-year comparison of Q1 earnings. First, FX. In first quarter, the foreign currencies where we operate were weaker year-over-year versus the U.S. dollar, primarily in Canada, Mexico and Korea, such that foreign earnings in Q1, when converted into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, were lower by approximately $42 million or $0.10 a share than those earnings would have been had the FX exchange rates been flat year-over-year. The big weaknesses started about a year ago. While I certainly don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, and there's been continued weakness, certainly, the biggest impacts look like the last 4 quarters. One of the benefits, of course, is it's made purchasing land and building units in some of these countries a little cheaper over the last year. \r\nNumber two, stock compensation expense was $36 million higher year-over-year in the first quarter or $0.05 a share. We have over 4,600 people in our -- who receive restricted stock units. For many of them, it is a significant part of their annual compensation. These grants are made annually each October in our fiscal first quarter. While these grants typically vest over a 5-year period, accelerated vesting occurs when a recipient reaches 25, 30 and 35 years of employment with the company. So factors driving this $36 million increase included additional levels of accelerated vesting given the rising number of employees achieving long tenure with the company. This, by the way, is most impactful each Q1, given our October RSU grant cycle; two, appreciation in our stock price, and of course, the larger number of employees in the plan. I'd like to note that because of the significant price appreciation in our stock this past year, this year's annual RSU grant, which occurred in late October, was reduced by an average of 12%. That is the number of RSUs granted to each recipient. So while there was a $36 million year-over-year increase in Q1, in the upcoming second, third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year, the anticipated year-over-year increases are estimated to be about 1/3 of this dollar amount in each of the fiscal quarters. So $0.01 to $0.02 earnings year-over-year impact each quarter in second, third and fourth quarters versus the $0.05 a share impact in Q1. \r\nThird point I'd like to note, there are 2 SG&A items that together, negatively impacted this year's Q1 earnings. In the first quarter, we recorded a $22 million charge related to 2 nonrecurring legal and regulatory matters. The $22 million figure represented an 8 basis point hit to SG&A and impacted our first quarter earnings per share by $0.04. \r\nPoint number four, IT modernization. As discussed in each of the past many quarters over a couple of years now, our major IT modernization efforts continue to impact our SG&A expense percentages, especially as new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. In the first quarter, on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs have impacted SG&A by an estimated $20 million pretax or 7 basis points -- 6 basis points without gas deflation, which is about a $0.03 hit to earnings in the quarter versus last year. \r\nPoint number five. Last year in the first quarter, we did call out that we had a $17 million benefit to gross margin related to a nonrecurring legal settlement. So that benefited last year's first quarter by $0.03 a share. \r\nAnd lastly, point number six, our co-branded credit card transition in the U.S. As you know, we'll be transitioning to a new co-branded credit card relationship in the U.S. next year. As we wind down our current relationship, new co-brand sign-ups have greatly slowed, and in fact, are now for now ceased. The short-term negative impact relates to monies we earned for new co-brand sign-ups. Year-over-year in Q1, this represented a $15 million or a $0.02 per share hit to our earnings. This will continue to be a small negative impact to earnings in Qs 2 and 3 and possibly into Q4 based on timing, at which time I'll be able to better outline how the new relationship should directionally impact our future results and the future rewards to our members under the new co-branded credit card program. I look forward to sharing more information at that time. \r\nSo 6 items of note. I added it up, it's about $0.27 of impact to our year-over-year earnings comparison. I know many of these things you may have in your numbers. I know some of them, you don't. \r\nTurning to our first quarter sales. In terms of sales for the quarter, our 12-week reported comp sales figure for Q1 showed a minus 1% decrease, plus 2% in the U.S., minus 9% in Canada and minus 5% in Other International. As we stated in our release, if you take out the 2 big impacts of gas price deflation year-over-year and the impact of negative FX, the plus 2% reported U.S. comp would have been a plus 6% for the first quarter, the minus 9% in Canada would've been a plus 9%, and the minus 5% in Other International would have been a plus 7%, such that the minus 1% reported comp would've been a plus 6%. And as we reported last Wednesday in our November sales results for the 4-week month ended November 29, our comp sales increase, excluding the impact of FX and gas, was similar to the 12-week first fiscal quarter, with total company comp increase of 6% and again, ex gas and FX, in the U.S., a plus 6%; in Canada, a plus 8%; in Other International, a plus 7%. \r\nIn terms of opening activities and plans, we opened 13 new locations in Q1, including 2 relos, for a net of 11 new warehouses during the quarter, which ended November 22. That included 7 in the U.S.; 1 in Canada; 1 in Australia, our eighth in that country; 1 in Japan, our 24th in Japan; and our second in Spain just outside Madrid in Getafe. That's our second unit in Spain. Two relocated locations were in Woodland Hills, California and Teterboro, New Jersey. \r\nIn the second quarter, we had 2 new business centers planned to open, one each in Westminster, California and in Hackensack, New Jersey. And for all of fiscal '16, we have a current plan to open up 32 net new locations. That could come down a little bit based on timing as we get into the second half of the year. A few may be delayed, but that's our current plan. Of those, assuming we were able to do all 32, 22 of them would be in the U.S., 3 in Canada, 2 each in Japan and Australia and 1 each in the U.K., Taiwan and Spain. Later in the call, I will review with you our e-commerce activities, our membership trends, additional discussion about gross margin and SG&A in Q1 and recent stock purchase activities. \r\nAgain, very briefly, sales for the quarter reported were up 1.3% to $26.6 billion, up from $26.3 billion a year ago. Again, on a comp basis, reported number was down 1%, but ex gas and FX, was up 6%. For the quarter, our minus 1% reported comp sales results were a combination of an average transaction size down 4% for the quarter. Again, taking out gas and FX, it would be up 3%, excluding again those items, at an average shopping frequency of about 3.5% for the quarter. \r\nIn terms of sales comparisons by geography, geographically for Q1, the better operating performing regions in the U.S. were all 3 regions in California and the Midwest as well. Internationally, in local currencies, the better-performing countries were Australia, Taiwan, Mexico and Canada. \r\nIn terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, during the quarter, which we looked at September, October and November, excluding FX and gas, within food and sundries, which were up in the mid-single digits year-over-year, sundries, meat deli and spirits were the relative standouts. Our hardline sales were up in the mid- to high single digits for the quarter. Majors, or electronics, came in positive for the quarter in the low double-digit range. In addition to electronics, better-performing departments included hardware and garden/patio. Within the mid single digits, softline comps, domestics, women's apparel and home furnishings were standouts. And in fresh foods, where our comp sales were in the mid- to high single digits, our produce was at the top of the 4 subcategories. \r\nMoving down the line items on the income statement, membership fees. In the first quarter, membership fees were up 2% and 2 basis points, or up $11 million, coming in at $593 million versus $582 million a year ago. Again, without FX, the dollars would've been up 6%. I noticed in several of the preliminary notes from some of the sell-side analysts out there, they had expressed some questions about the strength in membership. And I might point out a couple of things. In addition to being up 6% ex FX, on a cash basis, there was about another percentage point higher than these numbers, as well anecdotally a year ago, we did a couple of things outside with social media, which we didn't do. Small impact year-over-year, but something versus nothing. \r\nIn terms of membership, we continue to benefit from good sign-ups in existing and new locations, continued increasing penetration of our $110 a year Executive Membership and strong renewal rates, 91%, averaging up to 91% in the U.S. and Canada and averaging up to 88% worldwide. Our new membership sign-ups in Q1 year-over-year company-wide were up 7%. In terms of members at Q1 end, Gold Star was -- came in at the quarter end at 34.7 million, up from 34.0 million at year-end; Primary Business, 7.2 million at quarter end versus 7.1 million a quarter ago. Business add-on remained at 3.5 million. So total memberships, 45.4 million at quarter end, up from 44.6 million and including extra cards, 82.7 million cards out there versus 81.3 million 12 weeks earlier. At Q1 end, paid Executive Memberships came in at 16.4 million, which was an increase of 307,000 or 26,000 new Executive members increased each week in the 12-week fiscal first quarter. As you know, Executive members are over 1/3 of our member base and over 2/3 of our sales in those countries where Executive Membership is available. \r\nIn terms of renewal rates, in the U.S. and Canada, at quarter end, we were at 90.6%, rounded up to 90.6%. We rounded down to 90.5% at the end of Q1. That's the impact that I mentioned a quarter ago at Canada with having to re-sign up the members with the new credit card program, the de novo program. That was a real small of an impact. I think there was a little impact to the U.S. perhaps, based on what I said earlier. Total worldwide remained at 87.8% at quarter end and at fiscal year-end. \r\nGoing down the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the quarter was up 26 basis points, coming in at 11.29%, up from 11.03%. As you know, gas deflation is a big impact to these figures so I'll give you a couple of numbers. I'll ask you to write down the normal 4 columns. For all of fiscal '15, columns 1 and 2 would be reported and then without gas deflation, and then 2 columns for Q1 '16, reported and without gas deflation. And of course, these basis points figures are the year-over-year change from a year ago. Merchandise core reported was plus 11 basis points for all of fiscal '15, but without gas deflation, was minus 12 year-over-year. For Q1, it was plus 24 and minus 3. Ancillary businesses for the year, plus 29 and plus 23; for the quarter, plus 11 and plus 4. 2% Reward, minus 4 and minus 2; and for the quarter, minus 3 and minus 1. LIFO for all of last year was a 5 basis point pickup, both for the reported and without deflation. And for the quarter, it was plus 1 and plus 1. Other, last -- for the whole, all of last year, plus 2 reported and plus 1 without gas deflation, and this year, that nonrecurring legal settlement impact to gross margin that benefited gross margin a year ago such that it was minus 7 basis points reported and minus 7 without gas deflation. You add up those columns for all of fiscal '15, reported gross margin was up 43 basis points, but up 15 ex gas deflation. This year, Q1 reported, up 26, but without gas deflation, minus 6, with minus 7 of that minus 6 being the onetime benefit a year ago. So again, overall, those are the numbers. \r\nIn terms of core gross margins, which is the core business, food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percent of their own sales, they were positive year-over-year in Q1 by 13 basis points and they were higher year-over-year across all 4 of these merchandise categories, but with both hardlines and softlines showing stronger year-over-year improvement than the year-over-year improvement in food, sundries and fresh foods. But nonetheless, all 4 were positive year-over-year. Ancillary and other business gross margin was up 11 on a reported basis, up 4 without gas deflation for the quarter. Many of these businesses, gas, pharmacy, food court, hearing aids and mini labs, all showed higher year-over-year gross margins as a percent of their own sales. Offsetting this a little was slightly lower e-commerce gross margins, but overall, net positive there. \r\nThe 2% Reward was higher year-over-year due to higher sales penetrations for Executive members. This impacted gross margin in Q1 by 3 basis points to the negative -- 1 basis point to the negative ex gas. \r\nLIFO, last year in Q1 we had a $2 million credit, representing slight deflation in the U.S. inventory pools, and a credit of $5 million this year, also relatively small but a net pickup of a basis point year-over-year in terms of that recovery. Lastly, I mentioned the quarterly adjustment, a 7 basis point hit in terms of the comparison benefiting a nonrecurring benefit last year versus nothing this year. So overall, gross margins, excluding gas, were down 6 basis points year-over-year but up 1 basis point, excluding that 1-year charge -- nonrecurring benefit from last year. \r\nMoving on to SG&A. Our SG&A percentages Q1 over Q1 were higher by 28 basis points, coming in at 10.54% this year versus 10.26% last year, but excluding gas deflation, were lower or better by 2 basis points. I'll go in some detail and you'll see that the core expense components of that actually were pretty good. So again, 4 columns: columns 1 and 2 would be fiscal '15, the year reported and without gas deflation, and then columns 3 and 4 would be Q1 '16 reported and without gas deflation. \r\nOur first line item, core operations, minus 6 reported and plus 16 without deflation for all of last year on a year-over-year basis; in Q1, 0 and plus 26. Central, minus 7 and minus 5 for the year and minus 8 and minus 6 for the quarter. Stock compensation, minus 5 and minus 4 for the year and minus 12 and minus 10 for the quarter. Quarterly adjustments, no, nothing last year in columns 1 and 2, this year minus 8 and minus 8, that represents that $22 million item that I mentioned early on. So in total, last year for the year-over-year we reported SG&A up or minus 18 basis points and without gas deflation, better or lower, so plus 7 basis points. This year, higher by 28, so minus 28 basis points for the quarter reported, and without deflation, plus 2. \r\nWithin operations, again, without deflation, showed plus 26 or lower by 26. Within that, our core warehouse payroll was better year-over-year in the mid- to high single digits. Benefits were lower, better in the high single digits, and the combination of other expenses, a variety of them, were better or lower by 10 basis points year-over-year. So again, kind of the core -- control or operating expenses were all in pretty good shape this quarter. Central expense was higher year-over-year by minus 8 or minus 6 basis points without gas. As I mentioned earlier in the call, increased IT spending related to modernization showed higher year-over-year costs of 7 basis points, 6 without gas deflation. \r\nI already mentioned the -- earlier, the stock compensation, which was 12 basis points or 10 basis points without deflation. I also mentioned that, again, because of, certainly, the stock price increase, but also, importantly, the fact that there's more and more employees hitting 25, and in some cases, 30, and even in a few cases, 35 if they started back at Price Club, the total impact for the year, more than half of it, based on our estimates, is the impact in Q1, with about 1/3 or less of that amount in each of the upcoming 3 quarters year-over-year. So still going to be higher year-over-year, but not as high as that increase was in Q1. \r\nFinally, quarterly adjustments, again, related to the $22 million nonrecurring legal and regulatory items that I discussed. So overall, good expense control, other -- with plenty of things, and hopefully, I've been able to elaborate, share, shed some light on the components of that. \r\nMoving down the income statement. Preopening expense was higher by $11 million or 4 basis points higher. We had 9 openings last year, including 1 relocation; 13 this year, including 2. There's other preopening items in terms of countries and some other things. But overall, no big surprises there. All told, reported operating income in Q1 was down $3 million from $770 million last year to $767 million this year. \r\nBelow operating income, reported interest expense in Q1 came in at $33 million versus $26 million a year ago, so higher by $7 million. Interest income -- no, I'm sorry, lower by $7 million. Interest income itself was lower year-over-year by about $4 million, and the other component was lower by $3 million year-over-year. That's primarily related to various FX-related transactions. Sometimes, that's a positive; sometimes, that's a negative; never that meaningful for the year in its entirety generally. Overall, reported pretax income was down 2% versus last year, coming in at $762 million, down from $779 million pretax a year ago. Again, several items impacted year-over-year earnings comparison, which I discussed earlier in the call. \r\nIn terms of tax rates, our corporate tax rate this quarter was up about a percentage point, coming in at 36.1% compared to last year's first quarter rate of 35.2%. The higher tax rate year-over-year resulted from a few discrete items going to the -- increasing tax rate, not reducing it. And to a little extent, lower earnings penetration from our foreign country operations, where tax rates are generally lower than our income tax rates for the United States. \r\nNow for a quick rundown of other topics. The balance sheet, as has been in the recent past, is included in today's press release. Point out a couple of items: Depreciation and amortization for Q1 came in at $271 million. Accounts payable as a percent of inventory on a reported basis was pretty much the same year-over-year. Last year was 101%, this year 100%. Taking out non-merchandise payables, last year, non-merchandise payables as a percent of inventories was 92%. This year at quarter end, it was 90%. Average inventory per warehouse on a reported basis was up a little over 3% or $524,000 to $14.9 million. Again, ex FX, it would have been up 6.5%, at $960,000, assuming flat FX. About $0.25 million is electronics and what we call majors, and about $160,000 is apparel. Both built up inventory heading into the Thanksgiving week, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. As you could have extrapolated from our November reporting, where we reported the 4 weeks of November, the 12-week first quarter and the 13-week retail reporting calendar, or 4-5-4, the implication there, of course, was that the last week, which is really the first week of Q2, which is Thanksgiving week, was pretty strong. \r\nThe balance of the departments have been selling well, like hardware, housewares and toys. So really no issues of inventory levels going into the last few weeks before calendar year-end. We're in pretty good shape. \r\nIn terms of CapEx, in Q1, we spent a little over $700 million and our estimate for the year is to be into -- most likely CapEx will be in the high 2s, say, $2.8 billion to $3 billion. This compares to CapEx of last fiscal year of $2.4 billion. \r\nIn terms of dividends, our quarterly dividend continues at $0.40 a share or $1.60 annualized. This represents a total annual cost to the company of around $700 million. In terms of stock buybacks in Q1, we bought back a total of 898,000 shares for $130 million, so an average price of $144.88. \r\nNext topic, Costco Online. We're now into 5 countries, having launched Korea November 10. We're in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Mexico and Korea. For the first quarter, sales and profits were up over last year. Q1 e-commerce total sales were up 15% on a comp basis, total and comp basis, up 19% on a comp basis excluding FX. And again, it represents a little over 3% of our sales. We've been asked a lot of how, again, the week of Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, you name it. E-commerce sales were quite strong, up 28% and up over 30% in local currencies. \r\nNew initiatives. Again, it was a few years ago that we re-platformed the sites. We've continued to improve our mobile apps, and there's room to go, but they're a lot better than they used to be. Combined some of our e-commerce merchandising efforts with our inline efforts. We've added a few categories, like apparel, HABA and KS items. We've greatly improved timing of shipments by shipping out of more than just one depot across the country. And again, we'll expect to see e-commerce in other international markets in the future. \r\nIn terms of some of the others out there that are buying from us, we continue to provide merchandise for sale on the Google Shopping Express. This is now being offered in 6 markets: The Bay Area has recently been expanded; L.A.; Manhattan; and more recently, Chicago, D.C. and Boston. We've increased our offerings and categories and are currently testing fresh foods available in a limited group in each of the San Francisco and L.A. markets. We're also providing merchandise to Instacart now in 16 markets through the rest of the United States; Boxed in 3 markets; and we're also selling -- doing some business with jet.com in the 3 cities where they have their distribution centers. \r\nOutside of here, Alibaba Tmall, we currently offer just over 200 SKUs on the Tmall site, with a heavy emphasis on Kirkland Signature items. It's going well and we're certainly building some recognition for the Costco and the Kirkland Signature names. We had a very successful Singles Day on Alibaba Tmall, receiving over 300,000 orders. \r\nNext on the discussion list, expansion. Again, last year, we opened net new units of 23, so about 3.5% square footage growth. This year, again, plans for up to 32 units. If we achieve that, it would be about 5% square footage growth, and I already mentioned where those would be. Also, as of Q1 end, some of you want to know what our square footage is.  At Q1 end, it stood at 100,547,000 square feet. \r\nLastly, our second quarter fiscal 2016 scheduled earnings release, that would be for the 12 weeks ended on February 14, will be after the market closes on Wednesday, March 2, with earnings the following morning on Thursday, March 3. \r\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Brandi, and be happy to open it up for questions. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text3": "Just the first question, just a lot of moving parts for some of the onetime items. And I know you guys don't give guidance anymore, but I'd be curious how the quarter overall performed relative to the expectations that you would have budgeted back in August.\n\n---\n\nWe beat them.\n\n---\n\nYou beat them? Okay.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nThe second question, when you look at new member sign-ups, how has the trend been by age group? I'm curious your ability to attract younger customers given the success of Prime and other programs out there. Have you guys started to look at the sign-ups by age group, et cetera?\n\n---\n\nWe have, and I don't have the most current months detailed. But from a month ago budget meeting, we're getting -- first of all, the average age of a Costco member has come down. I think a few years ago, we were about 4 years older than the average in the U.S. Now we're a little under 2 years older. About 1/3 of our new sign-ups in recent months have been millennials and I'll make a point to provide a little more color on that each quarterly earnings release.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then last question for me, just on the gross margin. It's the first time in a long time that all 4 categories have been positive. Just curious if there's -- if you could provide a little color maybe by category, what's driving that.\n\n---\n\nWell, I think the one that's, historically in the last many quarters, that's always the one that's a little volatile, and volatile is mostly defined as down year-over-year, is fresh foods. And that has to do with the fact that as commodity prices have increased, we maintain prices, no doubt, in things like rotisserie chickens and the like. And that's -- I think there's been a little bit of deflation in some of those categories and some meat, but also, our volumes are particularly strong. When you've got a low double-digit comp in produce, as an example, that's going to help you, and because sales are strong, availability of products is good and spoilage is less. So those are the types of things that help you in fresh foods. I think the strength in electronics has probably helped us. Those are the things that come to mind. I don't have the -- Organics is helping. Organics, as I'd mentioned before, it's kind of a win-win for us. We get, for us, a fuller margin, a more fair margin within the confines of what we limit ourselves to. And in our view, it creates even a greater competitive moat given that, that's where, sometimes, retailers will try to make more.\n\n---\n\nAnd your organic penetration stands at what at the current time?\n\n---\n\nOrganic, well, it's $4-plus billion. It's still growing very strongly, but I don't have the detail in front of me, sorry. One other point, on the softlines, I know our apparel has been pretty strong, too, in terms of apparel basics. And so that's generally a full margin business.\n\n---\n\nSo Richard, a question on the fresh food deflation, right, as we -- and then, I guess, maybe it behaves a little differently by category, but if you think about meat and dairy in particular, is that less of a benefit to you margin-wise and more of a volume benefit in term -- just because you pass the declining prices through more quickly than most of your competitors by design, and so it's probably more of a help to volume than margin or no?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's more of a help to volume. If anything, we'll bring a price down and we'll always err to the low side. So if we have a calculated margin that's -- I'm making the numbers up, but $8.15 a pound, it's going to be $7.99. So you have all those things working towards that. But that's what drives...\n\n---\n\nYes, and the price elasticity on that is pretty high.\n\n---\n\nWell, when you have a hot price on strip steaks or items like that, yes. When you could hit another $1 a pound, if you will, lower or a few dollars a pound on some items, that could drive business. And needless to say, you've been in a Costco and talk about massing out big, good-looking stuff, that's, fresh foods is where we shine.\n\n---\n\nYou'd said e-commerce growth was down a little bit. Is that purely mix?\n\n---\n\nYes, there's been no comment, no -- nothing that was called out specifically to why that is. So I assume it's mix.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Then lastly, the levers that you got in core operations was better than we've seen in a couple of quarters. It was pretty broad-based. Is there anything you're doing differently, whether it's managing labor, benefit design, that would have -- because comp wasn't that different versus prior quarters. So was it something you're doing internally to manage those items?\n\n---\n\nI wish we do more here, but I mean, everything we do every day -- and I'm not trying to be cute here, but certainly, we continue to focus on things like basics, like overtime hours. Every 4 weeks when we have an all-hands budget meeting here, each of the 16-or-so senior VPs or country managers of operations get up and talk about things that they've done in their region to be more efficient, and I think that pays off. We have focus items that they talk about each month. They talk about other things, working with vendor -- working with buyers to create more seamless movement. All those things we really spend a lot of time on. One of the things that I think benefited us are our assumptions for health care cost, notably U.S., where it's most expensive and it's most inflationary, we've done a little better job with that. It was over, a little over a year ago that we made a few changes to the plan in terms of primary caregivers, primary within the plan. And that changed a little behavior. Not that big of an impact to the employee, but a better management of that, so I think we're still getting a little benefit of that there. But it's in the core payroll as well, and I think that's a combination of lots of little things, like I mentioned.\n\n---\n\nCurious if you can help diagnose the consumer. I know we saw some volatility in your monthly comps, and there's been some unevenness in other parts of retail. And you gave us some good color in November, but what do you think's going on? Does spending appear back to normal? I don't know if it was just a temporary hiccup.\n\n---\n\nI remember -- I think it was October when we said one month does not make a trend, and then the first couple of weeks of November weren't terribly exciting and then it got more exciting, so -- and middle of November and late November was quite a bit stronger than the first part of November. So again, I think we weren't really concerned when frequency was a 3 instead of a 4. But overall comps continued to be well. Our markdowns are in good shape, even though inventory's a little higher. So I think we still feel cautiously optimistic, and certainly, confident about what we're doing right now. I think the kind of the -- if you'd asked me what surprises me in the last month versus the last couple of months, well, electronic has finally turned, and that's, I think, a function of people coming in. Pricing keeps coming down. I think our fresh foods has been great. The fact that many times I'm explaining that fresh foods year-over-year margins are down a little. They were up a little. That's all good. So I think that reflects well on us. I can't speak to the consumer outside of that, though.\n\n---\n\nRight, so other than electronics, the complexion of what consumers are spending on looks back to normal, back to the old cadence.\n\n---\n\nYes, but that doesn't mean anything for tomorrow. But you know, what's nice when I look at the November results, which I have in front of me, underlying in the U.S., which is the big piece here, so it doesn't take -- eliminates the FX issue, Softlines was low double digits; fresh, notwithstanding some deflation; and the average sell in meat was good. Yes, and so I hope it will continue. Stay tuned.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and just a follow-up on gross margin, because I guess, the printed number is the highest number since our model goes back to '03. And you mentioned the 4 core categories were good, and I think you'd attribute it somewhat to mix. But big picture, right, the mix of product, is that -- that'll probably keep benefiting you. Can you give us a sense on the leverage with suppliers? How much of that side of the coin is helping you as well?\n\n---\n\nI don't think that -- I haven't heard anybody talking about major changes in leverage. I mean, we are -- I think if you ask our suppliers, generally, we are typically front and center with them. We're -- when freight rates have come down, as you might expect, some suppliers are reluctant to -- they're waiting for us to call them not to offer it up. Global sourcing, I think, is helping us competitively a little bit. So overall, I think we're still tough. I mean, there have been some suggestions out there that some retailers are going back to manufacturers to insist on extra monies. When we read that and hear that, we hear it from, as you might expect, and we have to understand that there's some people out there that sell to all of us and will share things each way. But you're going to find -- we're going to go back and make sure we get our share of that. So I think we continue to be tough. I don't think there's been any change in that.\n\n---\n\nCan you describe what you're doing to prepare for the transition to Visa? And as you make that transition, how are you going to inform your existing members and new potential members of the switch?\n\n---\n\nWell, I'm glad it's -- a lot of that's in the operations and membership marketing areas. There's a lot going on, needless to say, between our company and the new issuer, Citi, that's going to be coming out. There's going -- Citi and American Express are currently discussing what they need to be doing in terms of that transition. And again, contractually, there's not a lot we can say at this point. But rest assured, it's going to take several weeks, that transition. But the assumption is, is that existing members with the existing co-branded card will be getting new cards in the mail on or about the time of the actual transition. And it will be as, hopefully, as seamless as possible to them. Once we're allowed to communicate to our members about the new program, which again, contractually, we can't do that until that time, as you would expect, like anything we do, we're going to let everybody know and put it in big letters.\n\n---\n\nAnd should we factor into our model a potential disruption from the transition? Are you going to -- will there be a period of -- when you take both Visa and American Express for a period of time?\n\n---\n\nThere may be. Again, that's still in flux. I mean, there are some possibilities of that. But whether there's an exact transition, a binary transition or an overlap period of time, I don't really see a lot of disruption on that side. It's -- as you might expect, it's a royal pain to do this. But it's like -- it's what we do. You've got teams of people in operations that are working with our people in membership marketing and they are working with the outside -- the new outside provider to make it as seamless as possible, to have the communication out there, both in store, via e-mail, via letter. And so I think it's going to go a lot better than one might think. It's just a lot of work to be done.\n\n---\n\nUnderstood. And coming back to the topic of traffic. Three out of the last 4 months, traffic's been a little bit slower than the 4% you had been seeing consistently before that period. Are you just running into a point where there's now either limitations on how frequently some of your members, some of your most loyal members can shop, or limitations on the throughput that some of the stores are having based on the level of traffic that you're already seeing in those locations?\n\n---\n\nI think in terms of level of throughput, we keep doing a better job of that. We keep [indiscernible]. We keep, in my own calculations, keep raising the number of annual -- the amount of annual volume a warehouse could do. I mean, certainly, there's -- there'll be somebody in line saying, \"God, why did I come on Saturday afternoon?\" But at the end of the day, that's not an issue. Look, I remember in calendar '09, for calendar '09, the first year after the bad economy hit, we had a frequency number of around 4. And I was reminding people that if calendar '10 was 0, that compounded number of plus 2 for those 2 years would've been better than our average over the prior 20 years. And now we've enjoyed 7 years of fiscal -- calendar '09 through calendar '15, that have been slightly above 4 on average on a compounded basis. So yes, at some point, it has to come down a little bit. We feel very good about where it is. We can't look at any specific factor to say this is why it used to be a 4 and the last couple of months it's been a 3.5. We feel very good about where it is.\n\n---\n\nRichard, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about partnering with Instacart and Google and Google and maybe how that's going versus your expectations. And also, can you remind us how -- how the membership is impacted by that? If it were to roll out nationally, how does membership fee get accounted for in that? And then I have a follow-up question.\n\n---\n\nSure, well, each one's a little different. I believe with Google, you have to be a Costco member to go through the Google Shopping Express network. So it doesn't impact membership at all. Perhaps it gets a few members because there's some people that aren't going to come in but now they could get some things delivered to them. With respect to Instacart, I believe it's the Instacart memberships, and of course, they buy multiple memberships. That might be a slight decline if you assume that these were members that never came in and are now going to shop this -- going to switch and shop this way. They used to come in all the time and now are never going to come in the future. I doubt that's very impactful. None of these programs are huge relative to our numbers. We're agnostic -- I think what this shows is we're agnostic. We will sell merchandise to anyone who wants to be a member and buy from us. We certainly help them. We work with them and respect the fact that they're all trying to grow their businesses. So yes, I think starting from the point that many out there were concerned that everything's going to go this way and what's going to happen with all this brick-and-mortar, in our case, we see some changes. The net increase in some of these is there's a slightly improvement in total comp, recognizing you've got a few more visits that are delivered. But it's still a very small thing. And so there's not a lot of knowledge I can give you beyond that.\n\n---\n\nJust the other question was on the -- with the success of fresh food and organic and everything, are you still seeing space allocation grow to that area? And if so, where is it mostly been coming from? And is there a maximum allocation you can give to fresh and organic food?\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, a little of the space is flexible, so we're going to bring things out. When you see pallets of produce out there that isn't refrigerated, the stuff that can't, that doesn't need to be refrigerated, you'll see us there. We'll have some temporary coolers sometimes. You know, look, the big growth, when we were spending a lot on CapEx for what we call under the big phrase of remodel, but it was adding lineal feet of refrigerator and frozen, putting in more vertical stand-up coolers versus the coffin [ph] coolers and the deli and cheese areas. So we're getting more out of our space. We've added space. My guess is, is that there's less incremental space that we could do, but there's -- we're still doing it to some extent. And the other thing is that's an area where we can benefit by turning it faster as well. So a lot of our expansion was to enable us to turn it fast, not only more square footage or more lineal footage of doors but are more vertical cases, but have more merchandise out there, better presented and easier to grab. And I think we've done a great job in that area.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just lastly, the -- I think it's the CapEx, I think, you're saying is going to be up like $0.5 billion or so versus last year. Can you remind us what that extra $0.5 billion compared to last year is for?\n\n---\n\nSure, well, roughly 8 or 10 more locations. Roughly a few more expensive locations internationally. There's all that other stuff I talked about where we're adding -- still adding a few gas stations, still adding a few hearing aid centers...\n\n---\n\nDepots.\n\n---\n\nDepots, our infrastructure, which is, we think, a big competitive and profitable advantage to us. 84%, 85% of our goods now go through our cross-dock operations, where the average life of the majority of that inventory is less than a half a dozen hours. So we've got a lot there. I believe IT is -- hold on, I've got that number here. How much?\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nIT is -- I don't have it on here. I think that will be, year-over-year, it's going to be $60 million to $80 million. I don't have it in front of me, I'm sorry, but that's a piece of it as well.\n\n---\n\nSo Richard, I understand your comments on the MFi growth and the underlying trend being very strong. But as you look at the MFi ex FX, it seemed to have slowed off a strong 4-quarter trend that you saw through the third quarter of last year. So how much of this is social media offers? Are we lapping some big international openings as well? Basically, trying to understand what the right underlying trend in MFi growth is.\n\n---\n\nI don't see a big concern there. Some of this is social media. And we -- I know, anecdotally, one thing we did was a LivingSocial thing a year ago, which was very good. We've not done that again at a corresponding time this year. Yes, and I've not seen any comments from our membership marketing people when we reviewed the quarter with them of any concerns. There may be a little timing of openings, of international openings. But again, we don't see any big trend there that concerns us -- trend change.\n\n---\n\nNo trend change. Okay, understood. And then can you help us think about the gas? I know you get this question a lot, but you had some nice gas benefits last year. And the next quarter, you're going to lap, I think, what was an even stronger quarter the second quarter a year ago. So maybe anything on how much gas was a net benefit or a net detriment on a year-to-year basis quantitative, hopefully? But any qualitative comments, just to help as we think about this upcoming quarter.\n\n---\n\nWell, I'll tell you each quarter, but in Q1, again, one would have thought, one includes you guys and me, that gas profitability would have fallen down a little bit, still very good, relative to historic -- our history, but versus very strong numbers Q1 a year ago. We had pretty good numbers this time. I think year-over-year, it was within $0.01 of profitability. Flat to down less than $0.01 year-over-year. I think we also had very strong Q2 profitability that may be tough to match, but we're early in the quarter. And Q1 surprised me, maybe only be surprised there, but if it does come in a little bit, we'll certainly share with you if it's more than $0.01 or $0.02 delta.\n\n---\n\nRight, right, right. So a tougher compare, but you were surprised to the upside on this case. And taking that all into account, maybe it's not as bad as people fear out there.\n\n---\n\nRight. When you say surprise to the upside, I mean, we're still down year-over-year a shade. But again, last year was pretty strong, and Q2 was even stronger. We'll see how this quarter goes. The fact that gas prices and oil prices have come down a little bit, that generally bodes well for us. But again, I'm not suggesting it could be as well as last year. We'll see.\n\n---\n\nUnderstood. And just one last question on the traffic side. I know you said you don't really see a change in the box. But does -- in the consumer, does the fact that November was largely driven in the back half of the month concern you at all? Or is that just an indication of the consumer continuing to wait for the deals to come around Black Friday?\n\n---\n\nIf I do, I'd be doing something else. I -- we actually looked at it as a positive. We were starting to get a little concerned is it's slowing down a little bit, and I think the fact that we don't put as much emphasis on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, it still did well. But we've got a lot of people coming in earlier that week for -- crazy numbers of pumpkin pies and the like. All those things, I think, help us. The fact that electronics was as strong was a surprise to us. So I don't think we look at it that way at all.\n\n---\n\nRichard, I apologize for any background noise, I'm in the airport. But I wanted to just go back, first, to your color that you provided on margins, just to make sure that I captured some of the details that you listed out. When it comes to gross margins, to start, I believe you spoke to the actual core of 4 categories up once again 13 basis points, similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. You noted that if ex decycling of the onetime benefit from last year, gross margins would have been up an additional 7 basis points. And regarding the inventory levels, you stated that you feel pretty comfortable with those levels, just given how strong the first week of the second quarter was. Is that a fair representation of your color on gross margins? And how should we think about that going forward?\n\n---\n\nYes, but mind you, the 7 basis point of a onetime item, that's outside of -- that's not -- the 13 is the core business. It's not like it's 13 becomes 20.\n\n---\n\nCorrect. On the core, absolutely, right.\n\n---\n\nYes, yes. We feel pretty good about that.\n\n---\n\nAnd then regarding just SG&A, again, just for my clarification, making sure my table is clear. Stock compensation, you mentioned, was up meaningfully year-over-year, $36 million, I believe you said. So about a $0.05 hit or so on a go-forward basis. That will only be about 1/3 of the hit in the next few quarters?\n\n---\n\nWhat I was trying to convey is that because of timing, our annual grant to everybody is in late October because more and more of the recipients, particularly the recipients like myself who's been here 32 years almost, so you've got more accelerated vesting. So the entire hit is now not spread over 5 years. So it's really that's a timing issue. That's going to help you a little in the future. But the fact of the matter is because it's October, we had a big hit in October or Q1. So just taking the math of what we -- if you think about it, the actual hit to P&L this year is a function of those grants that would have been made over the last 5 years of that -- and then vest ratably 1/5 a year, adjusted when it vests faster than that accelerated based on tenure. So not only do you have more people on the plan today than you had -- as the piece from 5 years ago gets fully extinguished, you're adding a new piece. A, this new piece has many more people from 5 years ago. It has a stock price per share a lot higher. And you've got the vesting. The vesting, in my view, being one of the key ones. And so the way it hits, just simple math is, is that $36 million year-over-year change is more than half of our expected year-over-year increase in that line item. So if it was half in each of the next 3 quarters, it will be about 1/3 of 50% in each of those quarters. It's not those -- it's not quite that. But instead of being $36 million, it's going to be in the $10 million to $13 million range or $8 million to $13 million range each period.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then the legal hit, that -- is that fully contained into this particular quarter? And then also, on the IT modernization, the -- what should we -- how should we think about the cadence of those expenses going forward, relative to what we saw in 1Q?\n\n---\n\nIn terms of the $22 million, again, it's a couple of items that we're still in the process of. That's our best guess of the impact. We don't think there will be any big surprises there. If anything, you try to be reasonable and conservative. Outside of that, in terms of IT modernization, it's a little bit of a broken record here, but there is a light at the end of this tunnel, incrementally. And I'm hopeful that some time next year, we'll see that flatten out and come down. But there's -- we got a lot going on there. And again, it's part of our operations. It will come down as a percent of sales at some point in the future or it will come down certainly relative to the types of increases that we've seen. But it's necessary, and we're starting to see some deliverables finally.\n\n---\n\nLast from me is just on the International side. The Canada and International segment have been able to have a reasonable spread versus the U.S. in margins. I believe some of that's due to a little bit maybe less competition, maybe a little bit less labor costs. As you continue to grow the business and expand into new markets, how do you think about the margins in those segments going forward? Can it maintain a little bit of a reasonable spread versus the U.S.?\n\n---\n\nI think all things being equal, Canada is going to continue to be more profitable than the U.S. And some of these other countries are going to continue to be even more profitable than that, not all of them, but some of them. We have no illusions that some of the ones that are really outsized profitable come down a little over time. But Canada is mature, still growing a little in terms of new units, still growing nicely in terms of local currency comps. And it's nice that we're the only club in town. But that being said, we're still our own toughest competitor. We have a little extra margin there, not a lot. We have a lot lower health care cost as a percent of sales. So there's other things that help us up there, not just a little ex-U.S. margin.\n\n---\n\nThank you for all the color at the beginning of the call on the kind of onetime items impacting in the quarter. The question I have, Richard, you called out electronics as a point of strength. Could you comment specifically on the TV category and to what extent some of the new innovations in TVs are helping drive better electronics sales? And a follow-on to that is, is the holiday season, now that's it's gotten underway, what type of price promotions you've seen throughout the sector on TVs?\n\n---\n\nI don't have the quarter in front of me, but for the 4 weeks of November reporting, which would be through the Sunday after Thanksgiving, those 4 weeks ended then, within majors, which was up, again ex FX, in the mid-teens for the month, I think I said it was in the low double digits for the quarter. TVs for the month were up both in dollars and sales in the mid-20s, so it's quite strong. That -- now that may be because last year was a little weak, I don't know. I don't have that in front of me, but certainly it was strong. I think there is a little bit more promotions. Cell phones are strong. Tablets are strong -- I'm sorry, tablets have come down a little bit, but phones are strong. And those are the big things. Video games are strong. Again, all those other strongs or little weakers are dwarfed by television sales within electronics.\n\n---\n\nAnd to be cognizant, on TV...\n\n---\n\nI think the technology, the 4K, is helping, but the prices are coming down as well. I was there across the street yesterday, and you've got smaller flat screens with great quality, less than $200. You've got bigger TVs less than $1,000, and you've got as well the giant HD, 4K, whatever, under $3,000 and under $2,000, depending on what the size and the item and the -- some of the new technology. So I think all those things are helping us a little bit on that category. I pointed it out also because it's one of those that I've been -- we continue to get asked about, as dot-com continues to take market share of electronics and the impacts to other brick and mortars over the last few years. I think Best Buy has been a little better on TVs as well, but certainly, this has been a standout for us of late.\n\n---\n\nThat's helpful. And then one follow-up question. I know you addressed this in your prepared comments, but the inventory growth in the quarter. So if you look at it on a sequential -- year-on-year sequential basis, it did tick higher here, fiscal Q1. What explains that?\n\n---\n\nWell, the 2 biggest components of that $900,000 ex-FX number year-over-year is electronics, which is about $0.25 million, and that's planned and doing fine as expressed in these sales numbers. And apparel, and again, we are out there en masse on -- and these are basics. I mean, we're not going to be left over with a lot of red and green Christmas dresses because that's not what we sell. I mean, you're going to -- it's -- we're doing fine. We feel -- we have no concerns about our inventories, our markdowns. Something I know we learned years ago, the cheapest markdown is the first markdown and the quicker you get rid of the stuff that have problems. And our markdowns, overall, have been nothing to be concerned about.\n\n---\n\nMy first question, just wanted to get a little more clarity around this transitional period as you have to cease sign-ups for the card. You talked about it in terms of EPS impact on the quarter that you just reported and some residual impact over the next couple quarters. As we think about where this shows up in the P&L, is there any discernible impact on the top line? And if you could kind of dimensionalize the impact on the member fees as well, just to understand where we would model for that to happen.\n\n---\n\nWell, you're -- you say we don't have any new co-brand cards being signed up right now, so that's impactful a little bit to the membership line, not a lot. 99% of -- yes, it's going to -- that's going to go to sales. You've got everybody who has a co-brand card currently is still using it, so there's no impact there. Again, what I try to do, recognizing that the $1.09 reported figure was going to raise some questions, we just looked at what are the things, I mean, we can really look at. We have not -- given that our sales continue to be strong, we're not really looking at that line to see is this -- how much sales do we estimate we're losing. I assume we're losing -- in theory, you're losing a sale for somebody that signed up as a member that can't sign up for the co-brand card. They're still buying from us, they just don't buy -- they don't have the co-brand card. They don't have that reward. They've got -- they're probably using some other Amex reward card. Recognizing at its current strength, Amex is about 40% of our sales. There's still 60% of people that aren't using Amex, whether they're using debit or a very limited number of an old house card from [indiscernible], we don't own it, with -- from years ago, so -- or another Amex card. So we don't see a big impact from that. Is it greater than 0, the negative impact? Of course. But again, given where our sales numbers have been, this is something that there's specific pieces that are monies earned for new sign-ups in the equation, and so we pointed that out.\n\n---\n\nGot it. Second question, you talked about the seasonality of stock comp expense and the bulge you saw this quarter. Just to confirm what you talked about, I guess what you saw this past Q1 and what you talked about for the rest of the year, it seems to be seasonally a lot like what you had last year, even though it's a bit different from what you had over the prior few years. Is that an accurate way to think about it?\n\n---\n\nYes, yes. Now by the way, comp is -- it is part of our comp, and it is part of SG&A. We have always prided ourselves, for many years, we never changed the number of shares, so as the stock compounded at 19% a year, that piece of 3,000 or 4,000 people's compensation improved dramatically. As you may recall a couple of years ago, we reduced the number per recipient at whatever level that was by, I think, 15%. And again, we just did it again in the grant that just happened. Notwithstanding, you still see this big increase because of just how that works.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then just another quick follow-up on the demographic piece. You gave us a couple of interesting numbers, a couple of different ways to come at that question, I guess. Is the average age of a new member changing for you? Has that been moving in one right direction? You talked about it relative to the national average, and presumably, that couldn't happen without the average age coming down, but without knowing what the national average have done at our fingertips, kind of hard to know. And then also, members in multifamily dwellings versus single family, if you think about millennials staying in that kind of environment, in multifamily in general, gaining share from single family. I'm not sure if you're able to look at it that way, but any sense on how you're faring with that cohort.\n\n---\n\nWell, I never -- I'm not -- I haven't and I haven't seen any figures presented to me that way. I've said a couple of times in the last many months when people talk about millennials, I think the good news is we're getting more of them, and things like organic certainly help. Social media helps a little bit. Millennials is going to be an issue for the total pie in general, if people move home after college for a period of time, if they move into a smaller place, if they get married later and if they have fewer kids. It's going to rain on all of us. So we're certainly having -- increasing the share that we get of those people will help. But we're going to keep driving value and given the flexibility of the types of things we can continue to sell, and we'll see where it goes. But we have not looked at that. If we start looking at that, I'd be scared.\n\n---\n\nThis is Steven Zaccone on for Oliver Chen. Just 2 quick questions. As you look to the remainder of 2016, are there any areas in the assortment that you have an opportunity for improvement in your view? And then secondly, we just had a quick question regarding the E. coli situation. Have you seen any traffic disruption from the headlines? It does appear that you have the situation contained, but just curious if you're seeing any traffic disruptions.\n\n---\n\nOn the latter, no. It was, I think, contained pretty quickly, and the information was communicated pretty quickly. And I believe that the last possible episode related to Costco of someone being -- fallen ill was November 1. So we're trying to pass that. Thankfully, nobody was extremely hurt. There were a couple -- there was a few that did go to the hospital, and we -- I understand that they're all doing better now. So nothing new as it relates to that. I'm sorry, in terms of the other question, in terms of what's new. Again, it's more of the same, I can't give you anything specific that's top of mind. Organics continues, and KS, we're doing more things, but that's kind of steady as we go.\n\n---\n\nJust wanted to ask another question on the transition to Citi. As we get closer to that transition in the spring, just curious how you feel about it. It sounds like there's a lot of preparations involved. And maybe you could just remind us what's different about this in the U.S. versus what you did in Canada a couple years ago and maybe what you learned in that transition process.\n\n---\n\nWell, it just takes time. I think the main difference is, is in Canada, the new issuer was not able -- did not purchase the portfolio from American Express, and therefore is what's referred to as a de novo program, where our customers, members, have to sign up and reapply for credit. And so that's a little more disruptive. It impacts -- now it's a MasterCard up there, and so there are many people up there that have a MasterCard in his or her wallet already, so they still have something to use. And then in terms of auto renewals, part of our renewal rate is the fact that you have some members that do auto renewal, which as you might expect, statistically, has a slightly higher renewal rate because it's auto. And the assumption here in the U.S. is that the portfolio will be -- the transition will include the purchase of the portfolio, and I think the language which we've used in the past is, is that's what we anticipate because there's always a chance something can happen, but we're working towards that end, as you would expect the issuers out there. So again, it's recognizing that Canada is 10% of our company, and the U.S. is 70%, so these are bigger numbers. I would have guessed that if you look at the $15 million I pointed out as related to just earning -- revenues we get for signing up new co-brand cards, even if the same percentages occurred up there, it's -- it wouldn't even be worth calling out in terms of the company as a whole. So it's just going to take some time. I'm just trying to share with you what I can at this point. Nothing big is going to happen. We'll get through it, and we're very excited about the next many years under a great program.\n\n---\n\nThat's helpful. Any color you can provide on what percent of members do use the auto renewal? And anything else we should think about just modeling...\n\n---\n\nI don't have that at my fingertips, but I probably would -- we wouldn't share that. As many as possible would be the answer. If it makes it easier for the customer, then certainly, it gives them a reason to more likely renew.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then just another question, you mentioned, I think, 2 new business centers planned for this year. I was just curious if you could talk about how those are working, any relative profitability versus a typical club and just what you think about that format going forward.\n\n---\n\nWell, first and foremost, we're opening regular warehouse clubs. For a number of years, we had anywhere from, I think, 6 to 8 business centers that were doing okay, slightly profitable but not setting the world on fire. There were a lot of changes that were made to it a couple of years ago, and they are growing nicely. They are more profitable than they had been. And it's another avenue. It's going to be a lot smaller footprint in terms of how many units we have than a regular warehouse, regular Costco warehouses, but we'll keep adding -- we're doing this just like we've done everything, pretty methodically. On a base of 10 or so, we're going to open a couple. So it's not like we've discovered something that's -- we're going to go from 10 to 20 overnight in 1 year. So it's good. It's a positive business for us. It certainly is a focus on the business member. We also, might well, from time to time, identify items in the business center that makes sense to sell in all of our locations. So we think it's a positive. Some of the examples also is where we've taken an old Costco, which is smaller footprint, perhaps not as well located for our general population member, we'll -- as we're relocating an old unit, we will convert that other one in that city into a business center. So that's been helpful to us as well. We did that in South Atlanta. We did that in Chicago, I think, in Bedford Park. I believe the New Jersey location is a relocation, where Hackensack went to Teterboro. So I mentioned that we opened a new one at Teterboro that's a relo from Hackensack, which is now over, that several month period, is being converted into a business center. So we think it's good. It's -- when asked what's driving our earnings growth or what's driving our whatever, I've always said it's a lot of little things, and this would be one of them.\n\n---\n\nI have one quick question. Could you just remind me of the -- remind also the timing of the new credit card?\n\n---\n\nWell, our current relationship expires March 31. And there's a window of a few months in there post that, that this could extend. So it will be sometime between April and December is my best guess at this point.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then just, you're still -- you guys are still working very hard on your technology modernization. Can you talk about whether you've been pleased with the timing of everything and whether all the new systems have been rolled out smoothly? I mean, technology is notoriously late, but how is it going for you guys?\n\n---\n\nSmoothly would be an overstatement. I mean, I think in the beginning of time, when we talked about this, starting about 3 or 4 years ago, we said this is our best guess, and I half jokingly said, \"Whatever you think it's going to do, it's going to take twice as long and cost twice as much.\" And anybody that's gone through it, I think, generally experiences that. We're experiencing some level of that as well. That being said, we've got -- everybody is supportive of it. The deliverables that we have had, sometimes they've taken longer. They cost more. We've learned from what we didn't know. And as we find out, we do a better job on the next thing. And so again, overall, I think it's -- again, it's costing a little more than we thought. It's taking a little longer, but we're getting some deliverables over the last year, like a new membership system, a new point-of-sale system. A big rollout of really the foundation of our accounting system will be at the beginning of the new fiscal year. So we got a lot going on, but we're getting through it. And I wouldn't -- I certainly wouldn't gloat about it because we know it's tough, and it takes a long time, but we're getting there.\n\n---\n\nRichard, could you give us, like, a little bit of a color or some range on how many stores might be open this year? You said 32 on the top end. How low could that be? And where would you expect some of the shortfalls to be?\n\n---\n\nWell, 32 is my best guess. If I had to guess what's the low end, 27 or 28. That just simply means under 27, example, that means 5 in the latter half of the year, and the original budget would have been skewed out a little bit. Right now, I'm looking -- we've got 7 new units coming in Q3 in this plan and 15 in Q4, with about half of those -- a little over -- probably 8 of those in August. So I'm sure a few of those are going to slip.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nOh, okay. A couple of those have slipped back, because this number was 35. So I'm guessing -- so 28 to 32. Again, it's a fluid number. I don't think we've lost any, but we've -- I know a couple of them, we've already delayed -- might be a year delayed for zoning issues. One example, there were -- and again, we found some things underground that we -- that original core testings didn't find. So you're always going to find some things out there like that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Could you talk a little bit about competitive behavior that you're seeing out there, whether it's a reaction of more conventional stores to what you've been doing? There's not many retailers out there showing the comps that Costco is. Are you seeing any reaction in your channel and outside your channel and especially as you enter some new countries?\n\n---\n\nOverall, no. I mean, we are -- and I've said it many times. We are our own toughest competitor, and I mean that. With -- in our industry, notably Sam's, and to a little extent, BJ's, but certainly many locations where we compete head-to-head, we're in their locations literally every week, and I would assume they're in our locations every week. And we feel good about the competitive posture there. I think it helps that our average volumes are dramatically higher, and that allows you to do a lot of things, and I think the nature of our members. So I don't think we've seen any big changes there other than where we keep doing pretty good. As it relates to traditional competitors, I mean, regionally, we look at all kinds of things. In the Northeast, we look at companies like Wegmans, which is a great supermarket retailer that are opening more units. That's, in our view, our customer, a high-end customer, particularly in the quality of fresh foods. Although our fresh foods numbers are pretty good. So we're -- I think we're doing a pretty good job. We're helped by the fact that we can choose to do things like women's athletic wear, activewear, where we could literally create $100 million of sales on full-margin items that didn't exist a few years ago. And I think our global sourcing initiatives and things that gives us, we believe, an edge on things like produce. But you can't do it if you don't do the kinds of volumes we do. So I think we've got some good advantages out there, and we are, I think, one of the best at not resting on our laurels. So in terms of dot-com, again, we're pretty methodical about it. Some of the things we're doing are helping, albeit from a perhaps lower base than it could have been, but it's growing in the right direction in a lot of ways, and I think we're getting better at that, too.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted, Richard, to get your thoughts here, and maybe have the numbers even, what the penetration rate for e-commerce and services like rental cars and travel services and that type of insurance services, what the penetration rate is among your members. And if you have, what -- has it been growing?\n\n---\n\nYes, they're growing nicely. We do not give out that information. They're all pretty good businesses. They've all grown slowly over time. Travel is doing really well, things like car rentals. I could tell you I visited some shareholders recently on some proxy issues. And during there, I was just giving an example, though, of our rental car business, which has grown dramatically in the last year to well over 2 million rentals a year, and a lot of that is online. And in 2 different meetings, individuals who prided themselves on knowing how to get the best deal on car rentals went online during the meeting and were able to save on the same car from the same third-party agency, significant. So I'll share that with you guys, too. Go try it, and we've got to do a better job of communicating that. So those businesses are growing. They're all generally small percentages of the total, so I think that creates more opportunity for us. I think I read recently where if we were a car dealer, we'd be the second-largest car dealer in the country, based on number of new cars purchased by our members through the Costco Auto Program. All those are additional reasons to be a member. They're all very profitable and growing. And if they're very profitable, it means we're going to keep getting even better values. So it's all good.\n\n---\n\nAnd your e-commerce penetration rate, do you have that? Or is that something you don't want to talk about either?\n\n---\n\nWell, e-commerce -- in terms of -- what do you mean penetration?\n\n---\n\nHow many -- what percentage of the members are using your e-commerce offer?\n\n---\n\nI don't have that in front of me. It's probably not as much as it should be, and it will keep growing. And I'm not trying to be cute, I just don't have that number in front of me.\n\n---\n\nNo, that's fine. And then when we're looking at these things and we're looking at frequency, I would guess that these are outside your frequency. They don't get counted. Is that true?\n\n---\n\nCorrect. Our frequency is front-end transactions at the warehouse. So it doesn't include gas, pharmacy, optical.\n\n---\n\nSo if you shop the front end, no matter where else you shop...\n\n---\n\nRight. If you shop the front end, no matter where else you shop, it's just one transaction. If you shop just at the gas station, it's not a transaction in terms of our shopping frequency.\n\n---\n\nAnd e-commerce is not ringing up as transactions either -- frequency, frequency of transactions, but not frequency?\n\n---\n\nWell, e-commerce is like a warehouse, so that is adding up. But it's 3% of our business. So even if it's growing at 3x at 20-plus percent versus 7%, it's de minimis to that number.\n\n---\n\nRichard, I just had 2 questions, 2 quick questions. On the credit card, like the $0.02 hit this quarter, is that expected to be something similar over the next few quarters in terms of the impact? And I guess the question there is when you start to get to the new relationship, will there be additional marketing expense that you would also incur in addition to what's impacting the business today?\n\n---\n\nIn terms of the first piece of that question, yes. I mean, I don't know if it's around to $0.01 or to $0.03, but call it $0.02 is a guess, and it's a guess. The -- at the time of transition, there are monies baked into the deal, so I don't see any big impact to that hitting our numbers.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And you mentioned the Alibaba Singles' Day. Can you just give us any insight like how you're looking at China and essentially what you're learning so far from that relationship?\n\n---\n\nWe've been asked about China for 20 years and about every 2 or 3 years, every -- it used to be Jim -- Jeff and Jim and our Head of International, Jim Murphy. And now of course, it's Craig and Jeff and our international, Jim Murphy, and a few others in real estate. And we keep looking. At some point, we'll probably open a couple of units, but we haven't pulled that trigger yet to actually go forth. I would say it's probable in the next 5 years, but we got a lot going on. And for 20 years, we've never been terribly concerned about we got to get there now. So this gets our name known a little bit, but it's not like we've strategically sat down and says, \"Hey, let's get our name known for a few years and then go.\" The Alibaba Tmall thing happened because they came to us, and we didn't appreciate how much -- how many Kirkland Signature items were selling on their site before we sold them directly and at a better value.\n\n---\n\nI got the last one. I'll try and be quick. On -- as you mentioned earlier in the call, there were some of these onetime items that we were aware of, some that we were not. Just in terms of things like legal and regulatory, is there anything that we should anticipate in Q2, based on what you know today, that we should be factoring in?\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nAnd then you mentioned a little contribution from International, which contributed to the tax rate difference. I was just curious, is that just related to startup costs in areas like Spain? Is it just higher losses associated with that? Or is it something...\n\n---\n\nNo, not at all. What I was talking about is if you have $100 in Canada earned and year-over-year in the quarter, the Canadian dollar relative to U.S. dollar is down 15%, we bring it down at $85 of income, not $100 of income. So it's just -- and in Canada, the marginal tax rate, I think federal tax rate, I believe, is 26% currently versus -- I could be off a little bit, versus 39% in the U.S. In some other countries, it's actually a little lower or higher. But generally speaking, I believe the U.S. versus -- and the 9 countries we are, our effective U.S. tax rate on earnings in the U.S. is quite a bit higher than anywhere else, so as the penetration of foreign earnings to total earnings. It's that simple.\n\n---\n\nGot you, got you. So I had an opportunity to visit your Getafe club in Spain. It was pretty impressive. I think one of the areas that surprised me was the amount of local sourcing you're doing, especially in areas like fresh, and we heard about the -- some of the export activities with local vendors. I was just curious if you could expand a little bit on what that opportunity looks like when you -- not just for Spain, but other countries you're operating in, how much you're doing in terms of cross-border type sourcing for other clubs and whether it's the U.S. or Japan, et cetera? It seemed like it was growing.\n\n---\n\nI think -- first and foremost, the big thing is, is on multinational vendors getting the -- and a lot of times, with multinational vendors you've got 2 or 3 or 4 geographic world regions. And I remember when we went into Australia, and now we have 8 units instead of 1 or 2 or 3 a few years ago. Still with only 8, there are some divisions of even multinationals that aren't prepared quite to sell to us, make available certain things and certainly sell us at global pricing. That can only change when they get us involved. And again, since we have that meeting here every 4 weeks at the budget meeting, that's when that happens. And so I think a focus on that has helped us. As it relates to going into these markets, to the extent their items in those countries, that helps us both ways. And I think that's -- if you will, I think we do a good job of that. Those are all small little things that help long term. I'll give you an example back in Japan a few years ago. I forgot the name of the -- there's a very well known -- what's considered a very premium tea that's a Japanese-branded product, that they initially were reluctant to sell us when we entered Japan even as we had 10 or so units. Once we worked with them to provide a co-branded Kirkland Signature by that brand name. Not only in Japan, but it sells very well in Eastern Canada and along the West Coast and California. All those things are a net positive. It not only afforded us an ability to have a premium item with a decent margin and a new item in these other markets where we're strong, that market potential allowed us, I think, to procure items faster in some of those countries. So it's a win-win. But these are small, again, another small example.\r\nOkay. Well, thank you very much. We're around today if you have any further questions. Have a good day.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nJust the first question, just a lot of moving parts for some of the onetime items. And I know you guys don't give guidance anymore, but I'd be curious how the quarter overall performed relative to the expectations that you would have budgeted back in August.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWe beat them.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nYou beat them? Okay.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nThe second question, when you look at new member sign-ups, how has the trend been by age group? I'm curious your ability to attract younger customers given the success of Prime and other programs out there. Have you guys started to look at the sign-ups by age group, et cetera?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWe have, and I don't have the most current months detailed. But from a month ago budget meeting, we're getting -- first of all, the average age of a Costco member has come down. I think a few years ago, we were about 4 years older than the average in the U.S. Now we're a little under 2 years older. About 1/3 of our new sign-ups in recent months have been millennials and I'll make a point to provide a little more color on that each quarterly earnings release.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then last question for me, just on the gross margin. It's the first time in a long time that all 4 categories have been positive. Just curious if there's -- if you could provide a little color maybe by category, what's driving that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I think the one that's, historically in the last many quarters, that's always the one that's a little volatile, and volatile is mostly defined as down year-over-year, is fresh foods. And that has to do with the fact that as commodity prices have increased, we maintain prices, no doubt, in things like rotisserie chickens and the like. And that's -- I think there's been a little bit of deflation in some of those categories and some meat, but also, our volumes are particularly strong. When you've got a low double-digit comp in produce, as an example, that's going to help you, and because sales are strong, availability of products is good and spoilage is less. So those are the types of things that help you in fresh foods. I think the strength in electronics has probably helped us. Those are the things that come to mind. I don't have the -- Organics is helping. Organics, as I'd mentioned before, it's kind of a win-win for us. We get, for us, a fuller margin, a more fair margin within the confines of what we limit ourselves to. And in our view, it creates even a greater competitive moat given that, that's where, sometimes, retailers will try to make more.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nAnd your organic penetration stands at what at the current time?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nOrganic, well, it's $4-plus billion. It's still growing very strongly, but I don't have the detail in front of me, sorry. One other point, on the softlines, I know our apparel has been pretty strong, too, in terms of apparel basics. And so that's generally a full margin business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo Richard, a question on the fresh food deflation, right, as we -- and then, I guess, maybe it behaves a little differently by category, but if you think about meat and dairy in particular, is that less of a benefit to you margin-wise and more of a volume benefit in term -- just because you pass the declining prices through more quickly than most of your competitors by design, and so it's probably more of a help to volume than margin or no?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes, it's more of a help to volume. If anything, we'll bring a price down and we'll always err to the low side. So if we have a calculated margin that's -- I'm making the numbers up, but $8.15 a pound, it's going to be $7.99. So you have all those things working towards that. But that's what drives...\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nYes, and the price elasticity on that is pretty high.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, when you have a hot price on strip steaks or items like that, yes. When you could hit another $1 a pound, if you will, lower or a few dollars a pound on some items, that could drive business. And needless to say, you've been in a Costco and talk about massing out big, good-looking stuff, that's, fresh foods is where we shine.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nYou'd said e-commerce growth was down a little bit. Is that purely mix?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes, there's been no comment, no -- nothing that was called out specifically to why that is. So I assume it's mix.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAll right. Then lastly, the levers that you got in core operations was better than we've seen in a couple of quarters. It was pretty broad-based. Is there anything you're doing differently, whether it's managing labor, benefit design, that would have -- because comp wasn't that different versus prior quarters. So was it something you're doing internally to manage those items?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI wish we do more here, but I mean, everything we do every day -- and I'm not trying to be cute here, but certainly, we continue to focus on things like basics, like overtime hours. Every 4 weeks when we have an all-hands budget meeting here, each of the 16-or-so senior VPs or country managers of operations get up and talk about things that they've done in their region to be more efficient, and I think that pays off. We have focus items that they talk about each month. They talk about other things, working with vendor -- working with buyers to create more seamless movement. All those things we really spend a lot of time on. One of the things that I think benefited us are our assumptions for health care cost, notably U.S., where it's most expensive and it's most inflationary, we've done a little better job with that. It was over, a little over a year ago that we made a few changes to the plan in terms of primary caregivers, primary within the plan. And that changed a little behavior. Not that big of an impact to the employee, but a better management of that, so I think we're still getting a little benefit of that there. But it's in the core payroll as well, and I think that's a combination of lots of little things, like I mentioned.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simeon Gutman (Analysts)】\nCurious if you can help diagnose the consumer. I know we saw some volatility in your monthly comps, and there's been some unevenness in other parts of retail. And you gave us some good color in November, but what do you think's going on? Does spending appear back to normal? I don't know if it was just a temporary hiccup.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI remember -- I think it was October when we said one month does not make a trend, and then the first couple of weeks of November weren't terribly exciting and then it got more exciting, so -- and middle of November and late November was quite a bit stronger than the first part of November. So again, I think we weren't really concerned when frequency was a 3 instead of a 4. But overall comps continued to be well. Our markdowns are in good shape, even though inventory's a little higher. So I think we still feel cautiously optimistic, and certainly, confident about what we're doing right now. I think the kind of the -- if you'd asked me what surprises me in the last month versus the last couple of months, well, electronic has finally turned, and that's, I think, a function of people coming in. Pricing keeps coming down. I think our fresh foods has been great. The fact that many times I'm explaining that fresh foods year-over-year margins are down a little. They were up a little. That's all good. So I think that reflects well on us. I can't speak to the consumer outside of that, though.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simeon Gutman (Analysts)】\nRight, so other than electronics, the complexion of what consumers are spending on looks back to normal, back to the old cadence.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes, but that doesn't mean anything for tomorrow. But you know, what's nice when I look at the November results, which I have in front of me, underlying in the U.S., which is the big piece here, so it doesn't take -- eliminates the FX issue, Softlines was low double digits; fresh, notwithstanding some deflation; and the average sell in meat was good. Yes, and so I hope it will continue. Stay tuned.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simeon Gutman (Analysts)】\nOkay, and just a follow-up on gross margin, because I guess, the printed number is the highest number since our model goes back to '03. And you mentioned the 4 core categories were good, and I think you'd attribute it somewhat to mix. But big picture, right, the mix of product, is that -- that'll probably keep benefiting you. Can you give us a sense on the leverage with suppliers? How much of that side of the coin is helping you as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI don't think that -- I haven't heard anybody talking about major changes in leverage. I mean, we are -- I think if you ask our suppliers, generally, we are typically front and center with them. We're -- when freight rates have come down, as you might expect, some suppliers are reluctant to -- they're waiting for us to call them not to offer it up. Global sourcing, I think, is helping us competitively a little bit. So overall, I think we're still tough. I mean, there have been some suggestions out there that some retailers are going back to manufacturers to insist on extra monies. When we read that and hear that, we hear it from, as you might expect, and we have to understand that there's some people out there that sell to all of us and will share things each way. But you're going to find -- we're going to go back and make sure we get our share of that. So I think we continue to be tough. I don't think there's been any change in that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nCan you describe what you're doing to prepare for the transition to Visa? And as you make that transition, how are you going to inform your existing members and new potential members of the switch?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I'm glad it's -- a lot of that's in the operations and membership marketing areas. There's a lot going on, needless to say, between our company and the new issuer, Citi, that's going to be coming out. There's going -- Citi and American Express are currently discussing what they need to be doing in terms of that transition. And again, contractually, there's not a lot we can say at this point. But rest assured, it's going to take several weeks, that transition. But the assumption is, is that existing members with the existing co-branded card will be getting new cards in the mail on or about the time of the actual transition. And it will be as, hopefully, as seamless as possible to them. Once we're allowed to communicate to our members about the new program, which again, contractually, we can't do that until that time, as you would expect, like anything we do, we're going to let everybody know and put it in big letters.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nAnd should we factor into our model a potential disruption from the transition? Are you going to -- will there be a period of -- when you take both Visa and American Express for a period of time?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nThere may be. Again, that's still in flux. I mean, there are some possibilities of that. But whether there's an exact transition, a binary transition or an overlap period of time, I don't really see a lot of disruption on that side. It's -- as you might expect, it's a royal pain to do this. But it's like -- it's what we do. You've got teams of people in operations that are working with our people in membership marketing and they are working with the outside -- the new outside provider to make it as seamless as possible, to have the communication out there, both in store, via e-mail, via letter. And so I think it's going to go a lot better than one might think. It's just a lot of work to be done.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nUnderstood. And coming back to the topic of traffic. Three out of the last 4 months, traffic's been a little bit slower than the 4% you had been seeing consistently before that period. Are you just running into a point where there's now either limitations on how frequently some of your members, some of your most loyal members can shop, or limitations on the throughput that some of the stores are having based on the level of traffic that you're already seeing in those locations?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI think in terms of level of throughput, we keep doing a better job of that. We keep [indiscernible]. We keep, in my own calculations, keep raising the number of annual -- the amount of annual volume a warehouse could do. I mean, certainly, there's -- there'll be somebody in line saying, \"God, why did I come on Saturday afternoon?\" But at the end of the day, that's not an issue. Look, I remember in calendar '09, for calendar '09, the first year after the bad economy hit, we had a frequency number of around 4. And I was reminding people that if calendar '10 was 0, that compounded number of plus 2 for those 2 years would've been better than our average over the prior 20 years. And now we've enjoyed 7 years of fiscal -- calendar '09 through calendar '15, that have been slightly above 4 on average on a compounded basis. So yes, at some point, it has to come down a little bit. We feel very good about where it is. We can't look at any specific factor to say this is why it used to be a 4 and the last couple of months it's been a 3.5. We feel very good about where it is.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nRichard, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about partnering with Instacart and Google and Google and maybe how that's going versus your expectations. And also, can you remind us how -- how the membership is impacted by that? If it were to roll out nationally, how does membership fee get accounted for in that? And then I have a follow-up question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nSure, well, each one's a little different. I believe with Google, you have to be a Costco member to go through the Google Shopping Express network. So it doesn't impact membership at all. Perhaps it gets a few members because there's some people that aren't going to come in but now they could get some things delivered to them. With respect to Instacart, I believe it's the Instacart memberships, and of course, they buy multiple memberships. That might be a slight decline if you assume that these were members that never came in and are now going to shop this -- going to switch and shop this way. They used to come in all the time and now are never going to come in the future. I doubt that's very impactful. None of these programs are huge relative to our numbers. We're agnostic -- I think what this shows is we're agnostic. We will sell merchandise to anyone who wants to be a member and buy from us. We certainly help them. We work with them and respect the fact that they're all trying to grow their businesses. So yes, I think starting from the point that many out there were concerned that everything's going to go this way and what's going to happen with all this brick-and-mortar, in our case, we see some changes. The net increase in some of these is there's a slightly improvement in total comp, recognizing you've got a few more visits that are delivered. But it's still a very small thing. And so there's not a lot of knowledge I can give you beyond that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nJust the other question was on the -- with the success of fresh food and organic and everything, are you still seeing space allocation grow to that area? And if so, where is it mostly been coming from? And is there a maximum allocation you can give to fresh and organic food?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, first of all, a little of the space is flexible, so we're going to bring things out. When you see pallets of produce out there that isn't refrigerated, the stuff that can't, that doesn't need to be refrigerated, you'll see us there. We'll have some temporary coolers sometimes. You know, look, the big growth, when we were spending a lot on CapEx for what we call under the big phrase of remodel, but it was adding lineal feet of refrigerator and frozen, putting in more vertical stand-up coolers versus the coffin [ph] coolers and the deli and cheese areas. So we're getting more out of our space. We've added space. My guess is, is that there's less incremental space that we could do, but there's -- we're still doing it to some extent. And the other thing is that's an area where we can benefit by turning it faster as well. So a lot of our expansion was to enable us to turn it fast, not only more square footage or more lineal footage of doors but are more vertical cases, but have more merchandise out there, better presented and easier to grab. And I think we've done a great job in that area.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nAnd then just lastly, the -- I think it's the CapEx, I think, you're saying is going to be up like $0.5 billion or so versus last year. Can you remind us what that extra $0.5 billion compared to last year is for?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nSure, well, roughly 8 or 10 more locations. Roughly a few more expensive locations internationally. There's all that other stuff I talked about where we're adding -- still adding a few gas stations, still adding a few hearing aid centers...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nDepots.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nDepots, our infrastructure, which is, we think, a big competitive and profitable advantage to us. 84%, 85% of our goods now go through our cross-dock operations, where the average life of the majority of that inventory is less than a half a dozen hours. So we've got a lot there. I believe IT is -- hold on, I've got that number here. How much?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIT is -- I don't have it on here. I think that will be, year-over-year, it's going to be $60 million to $80 million. I don't have it in front of me, I'm sorry, but that's a piece of it as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Horvers (Analysts)】\nSo Richard, I understand your comments on the MFi growth and the underlying trend being very strong. But as you look at the MFi ex FX, it seemed to have slowed off a strong 4-quarter trend that you saw through the third quarter of last year. So how much of this is social media offers? Are we lapping some big international openings as well? Basically, trying to understand what the right underlying trend in MFi growth is.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI don't see a big concern there. Some of this is social media. And we -- I know, anecdotally, one thing we did was a LivingSocial thing a year ago, which was very good. We've not done that again at a corresponding time this year. Yes, and I've not seen any comments from our membership marketing people when we reviewed the quarter with them of any concerns. There may be a little timing of openings, of international openings. But again, we don't see any big trend there that concerns us -- trend change.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Horvers (Analysts)】\nNo trend change. Okay, understood. And then can you help us think about the gas? I know you get this question a lot, but you had some nice gas benefits last year. And the next quarter, you're going to lap, I think, what was an even stronger quarter the second quarter a year ago. So maybe anything on how much gas was a net benefit or a net detriment on a year-to-year basis quantitative, hopefully? But any qualitative comments, just to help as we think about this upcoming quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I'll tell you each quarter, but in Q1, again, one would have thought, one includes you guys and me, that gas profitability would have fallen down a little bit, still very good, relative to historic -- our history, but versus very strong numbers Q1 a year ago. We had pretty good numbers this time. I think year-over-year, it was within $0.01 of profitability. Flat to down less than $0.01 year-over-year. I think we also had very strong Q2 profitability that may be tough to match, but we're early in the quarter. And Q1 surprised me, maybe only be surprised there, but if it does come in a little bit, we'll certainly share with you if it's more than $0.01 or $0.02 delta.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Horvers (Analysts)】\nRight, right, right. So a tougher compare, but you were surprised to the upside on this case. And taking that all into account, maybe it's not as bad as people fear out there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nRight. When you say surprise to the upside, I mean, we're still down year-over-year a shade. But again, last year was pretty strong, and Q2 was even stronger. We'll see how this quarter goes. The fact that gas prices and oil prices have come down a little bit, that generally bodes well for us. But again, I'm not suggesting it could be as well as last year. We'll see.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Horvers (Analysts)】\nUnderstood. And just one last question on the traffic side. I know you said you don't really see a change in the box. But does -- in the consumer, does the fact that November was largely driven in the back half of the month concern you at all? Or is that just an indication of the consumer continuing to wait for the deals to come around Black Friday?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIf I do, I'd be doing something else. I -- we actually looked at it as a positive. We were starting to get a little concerned is it's slowing down a little bit, and I think the fact that we don't put as much emphasis on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, it still did well. But we've got a lot of people coming in earlier that week for -- crazy numbers of pumpkin pies and the like. All those things, I think, help us. The fact that electronics was as strong was a surprise to us. So I don't think we look at it that way at all.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nRichard, I apologize for any background noise, I'm in the airport. But I wanted to just go back, first, to your color that you provided on margins, just to make sure that I captured some of the details that you listed out. When it comes to gross margins, to start, I believe you spoke to the actual core of 4 categories up once again 13 basis points, similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. You noted that if ex decycling of the onetime benefit from last year, gross margins would have been up an additional 7 basis points. And regarding the inventory levels, you stated that you feel pretty comfortable with those levels, just given how strong the first week of the second quarter was. Is that a fair representation of your color on gross margins? And how should we think about that going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes, but mind you, the 7 basis point of a onetime item, that's outside of -- that's not -- the 13 is the core business. It's not like it's 13 becomes 20.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nCorrect. On the core, absolutely, right.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes, yes. We feel pretty good about that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nAnd then regarding just SG&A, again, just for my clarification, making sure my table is clear. Stock compensation, you mentioned, was up meaningfully year-over-year, $36 million, I believe you said. So about a $0.05 hit or so on a go-forward basis. That will only be about 1/3 of the hit in the next few quarters?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWhat I was trying to convey is that because of timing, our annual grant to everybody is in late October because more and more of the recipients, particularly the recipients like myself who's been here 32 years almost, so you've got more accelerated vesting. So the entire hit is now not spread over 5 years. So it's really that's a timing issue. That's going to help you a little in the future. But the fact of the matter is because it's October, we had a big hit in October or Q1. So just taking the math of what we -- if you think about it, the actual hit to P&L this year is a function of those grants that would have been made over the last 5 years of that -- and then vest ratably 1/5 a year, adjusted when it vests faster than that accelerated based on tenure. So not only do you have more people on the plan today than you had -- as the piece from 5 years ago gets fully extinguished, you're adding a new piece. A, this new piece has many more people from 5 years ago. It has a stock price per share a lot higher. And you've got the vesting. The vesting, in my view, being one of the key ones. And so the way it hits, just simple math is, is that $36 million year-over-year change is more than half of our expected year-over-year increase in that line item. So if it was half in each of the next 3 quarters, it will be about 1/3 of 50% in each of those quarters. It's not those -- it's not quite that. But instead of being $36 million, it's going to be in the $10 million to $13 million range or $8 million to $13 million range each period.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then the legal hit, that -- is that fully contained into this particular quarter? And then also, on the IT modernization, the -- what should we -- how should we think about the cadence of those expenses going forward, relative to what we saw in 1Q?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIn terms of the $22 million, again, it's a couple of items that we're still in the process of. That's our best guess of the impact. We don't think there will be any big surprises there. If anything, you try to be reasonable and conservative. Outside of that, in terms of IT modernization, it's a little bit of a broken record here, but there is a light at the end of this tunnel, incrementally. And I'm hopeful that some time next year, we'll see that flatten out and come down. But there's -- we got a lot going on there. And again, it's part of our operations. It will come down as a percent of sales at some point in the future or it will come down certainly relative to the types of increases that we've seen. But it's necessary, and we're starting to see some deliverables finally.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nLast from me is just on the International side. The Canada and International segment have been able to have a reasonable spread versus the U.S. in margins. I believe some of that's due to a little bit maybe less competition, maybe a little bit less labor costs. As you continue to grow the business and expand into new markets, how do you think about the margins in those segments going forward? Can it maintain a little bit of a reasonable spread versus the U.S.?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI think all things being equal, Canada is going to continue to be more profitable than the U.S. And some of these other countries are going to continue to be even more profitable than that, not all of them, but some of them. We have no illusions that some of the ones that are really outsized profitable come down a little over time. But Canada is mature, still growing a little in terms of new units, still growing nicely in terms of local currency comps. And it's nice that we're the only club in town. But that being said, we're still our own toughest competitor. We have a little extra margin there, not a lot. We have a lot lower health care cost as a percent of sales. So there's other things that help us up there, not just a little ex-U.S. margin.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Nagel (Analysts)】\nThank you for all the color at the beginning of the call on the kind of onetime items impacting in the quarter. The question I have, Richard, you called out electronics as a point of strength. Could you comment specifically on the TV category and to what extent some of the new innovations in TVs are helping drive better electronics sales? And a follow-on to that is, is the holiday season, now that's it's gotten underway, what type of price promotions you've seen throughout the sector on TVs?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI don't have the quarter in front of me, but for the 4 weeks of November reporting, which would be through the Sunday after Thanksgiving, those 4 weeks ended then, within majors, which was up, again ex FX, in the mid-teens for the month, I think I said it was in the low double digits for the quarter. TVs for the month were up both in dollars and sales in the mid-20s, so it's quite strong. That -- now that may be because last year was a little weak, I don't know. I don't have that in front of me, but certainly it was strong. I think there is a little bit more promotions. Cell phones are strong. Tablets are strong -- I'm sorry, tablets have come down a little bit, but phones are strong. And those are the big things. Video games are strong. Again, all those other strongs or little weakers are dwarfed by television sales within electronics.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Nagel (Analysts)】\nAnd to be cognizant, on TV...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI think the technology, the 4K, is helping, but the prices are coming down as well. I was there across the street yesterday, and you've got smaller flat screens with great quality, less than $200. You've got bigger TVs less than $1,000, and you've got as well the giant HD, 4K, whatever, under $3,000 and under $2,000, depending on what the size and the item and the -- some of the new technology. So I think all those things are helping us a little bit on that category. I pointed it out also because it's one of those that I've been -- we continue to get asked about, as dot-com continues to take market share of electronics and the impacts to other brick and mortars over the last few years. I think Best Buy has been a little better on TVs as well, but certainly, this has been a standout for us of late.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Nagel (Analysts)】\nThat's helpful. And then one follow-up question. I know you addressed this in your prepared comments, but the inventory growth in the quarter. So if you look at it on a sequential -- year-on-year sequential basis, it did tick higher here, fiscal Q1. What explains that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, the 2 biggest components of that $900,000 ex-FX number year-over-year is electronics, which is about $0.25 million, and that's planned and doing fine as expressed in these sales numbers. And apparel, and again, we are out there en masse on -- and these are basics. I mean, we're not going to be left over with a lot of red and green Christmas dresses because that's not what we sell. I mean, you're going to -- it's -- we're doing fine. We feel -- we have no concerns about our inventories, our markdowns. Something I know we learned years ago, the cheapest markdown is the first markdown and the quicker you get rid of the stuff that have problems. And our markdowns, overall, have been nothing to be concerned about.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nMy first question, just wanted to get a little more clarity around this transitional period as you have to cease sign-ups for the card. You talked about it in terms of EPS impact on the quarter that you just reported and some residual impact over the next couple quarters. As we think about where this shows up in the P&L, is there any discernible impact on the top line? And if you could kind of dimensionalize the impact on the member fees as well, just to understand where we would model for that to happen.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, you're -- you say we don't have any new co-brand cards being signed up right now, so that's impactful a little bit to the membership line, not a lot. 99% of -- yes, it's going to -- that's going to go to sales. You've got everybody who has a co-brand card currently is still using it, so there's no impact there. Again, what I try to do, recognizing that the $1.09 reported figure was going to raise some questions, we just looked at what are the things, I mean, we can really look at. We have not -- given that our sales continue to be strong, we're not really looking at that line to see is this -- how much sales do we estimate we're losing. I assume we're losing -- in theory, you're losing a sale for somebody that signed up as a member that can't sign up for the co-brand card. They're still buying from us, they just don't buy -- they don't have the co-brand card. They don't have that reward. They've got -- they're probably using some other Amex reward card. Recognizing at its current strength, Amex is about 40% of our sales. There's still 60% of people that aren't using Amex, whether they're using debit or a very limited number of an old house card from [indiscernible], we don't own it, with -- from years ago, so -- or another Amex card. So we don't see a big impact from that. Is it greater than 0, the negative impact? Of course. But again, given where our sales numbers have been, this is something that there's specific pieces that are monies earned for new sign-ups in the equation, and so we pointed that out.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nGot it. Second question, you talked about the seasonality of stock comp expense and the bulge you saw this quarter. Just to confirm what you talked about, I guess what you saw this past Q1 and what you talked about for the rest of the year, it seems to be seasonally a lot like what you had last year, even though it's a bit different from what you had over the prior few years. Is that an accurate way to think about it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes, yes. Now by the way, comp is -- it is part of our comp, and it is part of SG&A. We have always prided ourselves, for many years, we never changed the number of shares, so as the stock compounded at 19% a year, that piece of 3,000 or 4,000 people's compensation improved dramatically. As you may recall a couple of years ago, we reduced the number per recipient at whatever level that was by, I think, 15%. And again, we just did it again in the grant that just happened. Notwithstanding, you still see this big increase because of just how that works.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then just another quick follow-up on the demographic piece. You gave us a couple of interesting numbers, a couple of different ways to come at that question, I guess. Is the average age of a new member changing for you? Has that been moving in one right direction? You talked about it relative to the national average, and presumably, that couldn't happen without the average age coming down, but without knowing what the national average have done at our fingertips, kind of hard to know. And then also, members in multifamily dwellings versus single family, if you think about millennials staying in that kind of environment, in multifamily in general, gaining share from single family. I'm not sure if you're able to look at it that way, but any sense on how you're faring with that cohort.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I never -- I'm not -- I haven't and I haven't seen any figures presented to me that way. I've said a couple of times in the last many months when people talk about millennials, I think the good news is we're getting more of them, and things like organic certainly help. Social media helps a little bit. Millennials is going to be an issue for the total pie in general, if people move home after college for a period of time, if they move into a smaller place, if they get married later and if they have fewer kids. It's going to rain on all of us. So we're certainly having -- increasing the share that we get of those people will help. But we're going to keep driving value and given the flexibility of the types of things we can continue to sell, and we'll see where it goes. But we have not looked at that. If we start looking at that, I'd be scared.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Zaccone (Analysts)】\nThis is Steven Zaccone on for Oliver Chen. Just 2 quick questions. As you look to the remainder of 2016, are there any areas in the assortment that you have an opportunity for improvement in your view? And then secondly, we just had a quick question regarding the E. coli situation. Have you seen any traffic disruption from the headlines? It does appear that you have the situation contained, but just curious if you're seeing any traffic disruptions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nOn the latter, no. It was, I think, contained pretty quickly, and the information was communicated pretty quickly. And I believe that the last possible episode related to Costco of someone being -- fallen ill was November 1. So we're trying to pass that. Thankfully, nobody was extremely hurt. There were a couple -- there was a few that did go to the hospital, and we -- I understand that they're all doing better now. So nothing new as it relates to that. I'm sorry, in terms of the other question, in terms of what's new. Again, it's more of the same, I can't give you anything specific that's top of mind. Organics continues, and KS, we're doing more things, but that's kind of steady as we go.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nJust wanted to ask another question on the transition to Citi. As we get closer to that transition in the spring, just curious how you feel about it. It sounds like there's a lot of preparations involved. And maybe you could just remind us what's different about this in the U.S. versus what you did in Canada a couple years ago and maybe what you learned in that transition process.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, it just takes time. I think the main difference is, is in Canada, the new issuer was not able -- did not purchase the portfolio from American Express, and therefore is what's referred to as a de novo program, where our customers, members, have to sign up and reapply for credit. And so that's a little more disruptive. It impacts -- now it's a MasterCard up there, and so there are many people up there that have a MasterCard in his or her wallet already, so they still have something to use. And then in terms of auto renewals, part of our renewal rate is the fact that you have some members that do auto renewal, which as you might expect, statistically, has a slightly higher renewal rate because it's auto. And the assumption here in the U.S. is that the portfolio will be -- the transition will include the purchase of the portfolio, and I think the language which we've used in the past is, is that's what we anticipate because there's always a chance something can happen, but we're working towards that end, as you would expect the issuers out there. So again, it's recognizing that Canada is 10% of our company, and the U.S. is 70%, so these are bigger numbers. I would have guessed that if you look at the $15 million I pointed out as related to just earning -- revenues we get for signing up new co-brand cards, even if the same percentages occurred up there, it's -- it wouldn't even be worth calling out in terms of the company as a whole. So it's just going to take some time. I'm just trying to share with you what I can at this point. Nothing big is going to happen. We'll get through it, and we're very excited about the next many years under a great program.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nThat's helpful. Any color you can provide on what percent of members do use the auto renewal? And anything else we should think about just modeling...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI don't have that at my fingertips, but I probably would -- we wouldn't share that. As many as possible would be the answer. If it makes it easier for the customer, then certainly, it gives them a reason to more likely renew.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then just another question, you mentioned, I think, 2 new business centers planned for this year. I was just curious if you could talk about how those are working, any relative profitability versus a typical club and just what you think about that format going forward.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, first and foremost, we're opening regular warehouse clubs. For a number of years, we had anywhere from, I think, 6 to 8 business centers that were doing okay, slightly profitable but not setting the world on fire. There were a lot of changes that were made to it a couple of years ago, and they are growing nicely. They are more profitable than they had been. And it's another avenue. It's going to be a lot smaller footprint in terms of how many units we have than a regular warehouse, regular Costco warehouses, but we'll keep adding -- we're doing this just like we've done everything, pretty methodically. On a base of 10 or so, we're going to open a couple. So it's not like we've discovered something that's -- we're going to go from 10 to 20 overnight in 1 year. So it's good. It's a positive business for us. It certainly is a focus on the business member. We also, might well, from time to time, identify items in the business center that makes sense to sell in all of our locations. So we think it's a positive. Some of the examples also is where we've taken an old Costco, which is smaller footprint, perhaps not as well located for our general population member, we'll -- as we're relocating an old unit, we will convert that other one in that city into a business center. So that's been helpful to us as well. We did that in South Atlanta. We did that in Chicago, I think, in Bedford Park. I believe the New Jersey location is a relocation, where Hackensack went to Teterboro. So I mentioned that we opened a new one at Teterboro that's a relo from Hackensack, which is now over, that several month period, is being converted into a business center. So we think it's good. It's -- when asked what's driving our earnings growth or what's driving our whatever, I've always said it's a lot of little things, and this would be one of them.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nI have one quick question. Could you just remind me of the -- remind also the timing of the new credit card?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, our current relationship expires March 31. And there's a window of a few months in there post that, that this could extend. So it will be sometime between April and December is my best guess at this point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then just, you're still -- you guys are still working very hard on your technology modernization. Can you talk about whether you've been pleased with the timing of everything and whether all the new systems have been rolled out smoothly? I mean, technology is notoriously late, but how is it going for you guys?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nSmoothly would be an overstatement. I mean, I think in the beginning of time, when we talked about this, starting about 3 or 4 years ago, we said this is our best guess, and I half jokingly said, \"Whatever you think it's going to do, it's going to take twice as long and cost twice as much.\" And anybody that's gone through it, I think, generally experiences that. We're experiencing some level of that as well. That being said, we've got -- everybody is supportive of it. The deliverables that we have had, sometimes they've taken longer. They cost more. We've learned from what we didn't know. And as we find out, we do a better job on the next thing. And so again, overall, I think it's -- again, it's costing a little more than we thought. It's taking a little longer, but we're getting some deliverables over the last year, like a new membership system, a new point-of-sale system. A big rollout of really the foundation of our accounting system will be at the beginning of the new fiscal year. So we got a lot going on, but we're getting through it. And I wouldn't -- I certainly wouldn't gloat about it because we know it's tough, and it takes a long time, but we're getting there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nRichard, could you give us, like, a little bit of a color or some range on how many stores might be open this year? You said 32 on the top end. How low could that be? And where would you expect some of the shortfalls to be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, 32 is my best guess. If I had to guess what's the low end, 27 or 28. That just simply means under 27, example, that means 5 in the latter half of the year, and the original budget would have been skewed out a little bit. Right now, I'm looking -- we've got 7 new units coming in Q3 in this plan and 15 in Q4, with about half of those -- a little over -- probably 8 of those in August. So I'm sure a few of those are going to slip.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nOh, okay. A couple of those have slipped back, because this number was 35. So I'm guessing -- so 28 to 32. Again, it's a fluid number. I don't think we've lost any, but we've -- I know a couple of them, we've already delayed -- might be a year delayed for zoning issues. One example, there were -- and again, we found some things underground that we -- that original core testings didn't find. So you're always going to find some things out there like that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nOkay. Could you talk a little bit about competitive behavior that you're seeing out there, whether it's a reaction of more conventional stores to what you've been doing? There's not many retailers out there showing the comps that Costco is. Are you seeing any reaction in your channel and outside your channel and especially as you enter some new countries?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nOverall, no. I mean, we are -- and I've said it many times. We are our own toughest competitor, and I mean that. With -- in our industry, notably Sam's, and to a little extent, BJ's, but certainly many locations where we compete head-to-head, we're in their locations literally every week, and I would assume they're in our locations every week. And we feel good about the competitive posture there. I think it helps that our average volumes are dramatically higher, and that allows you to do a lot of things, and I think the nature of our members. So I don't think we've seen any big changes there other than where we keep doing pretty good. As it relates to traditional competitors, I mean, regionally, we look at all kinds of things. In the Northeast, we look at companies like Wegmans, which is a great supermarket retailer that are opening more units. That's, in our view, our customer, a high-end customer, particularly in the quality of fresh foods. Although our fresh foods numbers are pretty good. So we're -- I think we're doing a pretty good job. We're helped by the fact that we can choose to do things like women's athletic wear, activewear, where we could literally create $100 million of sales on full-margin items that didn't exist a few years ago. And I think our global sourcing initiatives and things that gives us, we believe, an edge on things like produce. But you can't do it if you don't do the kinds of volumes we do. So I think we've got some good advantages out there, and we are, I think, one of the best at not resting on our laurels. So in terms of dot-com, again, we're pretty methodical about it. Some of the things we're doing are helping, albeit from a perhaps lower base than it could have been, but it's growing in the right direction in a lot of ways, and I think we're getting better at that, too.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nI just wanted, Richard, to get your thoughts here, and maybe have the numbers even, what the penetration rate for e-commerce and services like rental cars and travel services and that type of insurance services, what the penetration rate is among your members. And if you have, what -- has it been growing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes, they're growing nicely. We do not give out that information. They're all pretty good businesses. They've all grown slowly over time. Travel is doing really well, things like car rentals. I could tell you I visited some shareholders recently on some proxy issues. And during there, I was just giving an example, though, of our rental car business, which has grown dramatically in the last year to well over 2 million rentals a year, and a lot of that is online. And in 2 different meetings, individuals who prided themselves on knowing how to get the best deal on car rentals went online during the meeting and were able to save on the same car from the same third-party agency, significant. So I'll share that with you guys, too. Go try it, and we've got to do a better job of communicating that. So those businesses are growing. They're all generally small percentages of the total, so I think that creates more opportunity for us. I think I read recently where if we were a car dealer, we'd be the second-largest car dealer in the country, based on number of new cars purchased by our members through the Costco Auto Program. All those are additional reasons to be a member. They're all very profitable and growing. And if they're very profitable, it means we're going to keep getting even better values. So it's all good.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nAnd your e-commerce penetration rate, do you have that? Or is that something you don't want to talk about either?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, e-commerce -- in terms of -- what do you mean penetration?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nHow many -- what percentage of the members are using your e-commerce offer?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI don't have that in front of me. It's probably not as much as it should be, and it will keep growing. And I'm not trying to be cute, I just don't have that number in front of me.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nNo, that's fine. And then when we're looking at these things and we're looking at frequency, I would guess that these are outside your frequency. They don't get counted. Is that true?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nCorrect. Our frequency is front-end transactions at the warehouse. So it doesn't include gas, pharmacy, optical.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nSo if you shop the front end, no matter where else you shop...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nRight. If you shop the front end, no matter where else you shop, it's just one transaction. If you shop just at the gas station, it's not a transaction in terms of our shopping frequency.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nAnd e-commerce is not ringing up as transactions either -- frequency, frequency of transactions, but not frequency?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, e-commerce is like a warehouse, so that is adding up. But it's 3% of our business. So even if it's growing at 3x at 20-plus percent versus 7%, it's de minimis to that number.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nRichard, I just had 2 questions, 2 quick questions. On the credit card, like the $0.02 hit this quarter, is that expected to be something similar over the next few quarters in terms of the impact? And I guess the question there is when you start to get to the new relationship, will there be additional marketing expense that you would also incur in addition to what's impacting the business today?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIn terms of the first piece of that question, yes. I mean, I don't know if it's around to $0.01 or to $0.03, but call it $0.02 is a guess, and it's a guess. The -- at the time of transition, there are monies baked into the deal, so I don't see any big impact to that hitting our numbers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nGot it. And you mentioned the Alibaba Singles' Day. Can you just give us any insight like how you're looking at China and essentially what you're learning so far from that relationship?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWe've been asked about China for 20 years and about every 2 or 3 years, every -- it used to be Jim -- Jeff and Jim and our Head of International, Jim Murphy. And now of course, it's Craig and Jeff and our international, Jim Murphy, and a few others in real estate. And we keep looking. At some point, we'll probably open a couple of units, but we haven't pulled that trigger yet to actually go forth. I would say it's probable in the next 5 years, but we got a lot going on. And for 20 years, we've never been terribly concerned about we got to get there now. So this gets our name known a little bit, but it's not like we've strategically sat down and says, \"Hey, let's get our name known for a few years and then go.\" The Alibaba Tmall thing happened because they came to us, and we didn't appreciate how much -- how many Kirkland Signature items were selling on their site before we sold them directly and at a better value.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nI got the last one. I'll try and be quick. On -- as you mentioned earlier in the call, there were some of these onetime items that we were aware of, some that we were not. Just in terms of things like legal and regulatory, is there anything that we should anticipate in Q2, based on what you know today, that we should be factoring in?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nAnd then you mentioned a little contribution from International, which contributed to the tax rate difference. I was just curious, is that just related to startup costs in areas like Spain? Is it just higher losses associated with that? Or is it something...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nNo, not at all. What I was talking about is if you have $100 in Canada earned and year-over-year in the quarter, the Canadian dollar relative to U.S. dollar is down 15%, we bring it down at $85 of income, not $100 of income. So it's just -- and in Canada, the marginal tax rate, I think federal tax rate, I believe, is 26% currently versus -- I could be off a little bit, versus 39% in the U.S. In some other countries, it's actually a little lower or higher. But generally speaking, I believe the U.S. versus -- and the 9 countries we are, our effective U.S. tax rate on earnings in the U.S. is quite a bit higher than anywhere else, so as the penetration of foreign earnings to total earnings. It's that simple.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nGot you, got you. So I had an opportunity to visit your Getafe club in Spain. It was pretty impressive. I think one of the areas that surprised me was the amount of local sourcing you're doing, especially in areas like fresh, and we heard about the -- some of the export activities with local vendors. I was just curious if you could expand a little bit on what that opportunity looks like when you -- not just for Spain, but other countries you're operating in, how much you're doing in terms of cross-border type sourcing for other clubs and whether it's the U.S. or Japan, et cetera? It seemed like it was growing.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI think -- first and foremost, the big thing is, is on multinational vendors getting the -- and a lot of times, with multinational vendors you've got 2 or 3 or 4 geographic world regions. And I remember when we went into Australia, and now we have 8 units instead of 1 or 2 or 3 a few years ago. Still with only 8, there are some divisions of even multinationals that aren't prepared quite to sell to us, make available certain things and certainly sell us at global pricing. That can only change when they get us involved. And again, since we have that meeting here every 4 weeks at the budget meeting, that's when that happens. And so I think a focus on that has helped us. As it relates to going into these markets, to the extent their items in those countries, that helps us both ways. And I think that's -- if you will, I think we do a good job of that. Those are all small little things that help long term. I'll give you an example back in Japan a few years ago. I forgot the name of the -- there's a very well known -- what's considered a very premium tea that's a Japanese-branded product, that they initially were reluctant to sell us when we entered Japan even as we had 10 or so units. Once we worked with them to provide a co-branded Kirkland Signature by that brand name. Not only in Japan, but it sells very well in Eastern Canada and along the West Coast and California. All those things are a net positive. It not only afforded us an ability to have a premium item with a decent margin and a new item in these other markets where we're strong, that market potential allowed us, I think, to procure items faster in some of those countries. So it's a win-win. But these are small, again, another small example.\r\nOkay. Well, thank you very much. We're around today if you have any further questions. Have a good day.",

Presenting to you this morning are Dave McKay, President and Chief Executive Officer; Janice Fukakusa, Chief Administrative Officer and CFO; and Mark Hughes, Chief Risk Officer. Following their comments, we will open the call for questions from analysts. The call is 1-hour long and will end at 9:00 a.m. [Operator Instructions] We will be posting management's remarks on our website shortly after the call.\r\nJoining us for your questions are Doug Guzman, Group Head, Wealth Management and Insurance; Doug McGregor, Group Head, Capital Markets and Investor & Treasury Services; Jennifer Tory, Group Head, Personal & Commercial Banking; Zabeen Hirji, Chief Human Resources Officer; and Bruce Ross, Group Head, Technology and Operations.\r\nAs noted on Slide 2, our comments may contain forward-looking statements, which involve applying assumptions and have inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these statements.\r\nI will now turn the call over to Dave McKay.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Amy, and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported record Q4 earnings of over $2.5 billion, up 11% from last year. These results capped off a record year with earnings of $10 billion, up 11% from last year or 9% on an adjusted basis. I'm very proud to say that we're the first Canadian company to earn over $10 billion in a given fiscal year.\r\nWe met all of our financial performance objectives. We grew earnings per share by 12%, we delivered a strong return on equity of 18.6%, and we exited the year with a very strong CET1 ratio of 10.6%. And we increased our quarterly dividend twice during the year, for an annualized dividend increase of 8%, all of which helped drive solid shareholder returns. I'm very pleased with these results, particularly since the macroeconomic environment was more challenging for us and our clients than we expected at the beginning of the year.\r\nI'd like to share my perspective on the full year performance of our business segments. Canadian Banking had a solid year with earnings growth of 5% despite slowing economic conditions, particularly in the first half of the year, which prompted the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates twice. Clients took advantage of the historically low interest rates, and we saw strong growth in residential mortgages with balances up 6% from last year. While the overall market grew, we were able to capture a disproportionate share of the growth due to the success of our employee pricing campaign. In addition, we also saw clients switch out of secured lines of credit and into mortgage products to take advantage of better rates, which also contributed to our mortgage growth. As Mark will discuss, we continued to lend prudently, working directly with our clients to manage their debt.\r\nWe also had excellent growth in our cards business this year, with balances up 7% as we continue to deliver a compelling value proposition to our clients. In fact, RBC ranks #1 in 4 out of 5 categories in a recent Rewards Canada report on travel cards.\r\nWith our strong product offering, including the flagship Avion and WestJet cards, we've opened over 1 million new client accounts over the past 2 years, and we've seen a growing number of clients switch over to RBC cards.\r\nAs a result of technology enhancements we've made to our online sales platform, we've seen a 30% increase in the number of clients purchasing cards through digital channels.\r\nTurning to deposits. We have the #1 franchise in Canada with an industry-leading market share of combined consumer and business deposits. Our successful marketing campaigns drove double-digit growth in core checking volumes this year and attracted a significant number of new clients to RBC.\r\nCore checking accounts were a key anchor product for us, and within the first 3 months, our clients typically expand their relationship with up to 2 or 3 additional products.\r\nOn the business side, deposits were up 10% from last year. Given market uncertainty, many clients wanted to keep their excess funds liquid, and we've supported them through our range of savings products, including a new high-interest account.\r\nMoving to investment products. We continue to see strong client demand despite challenging market conditions this year. Client flows were strong as we leveraged the power of our distribution network and breadth of our product suite to drive 9% growth in mutual fund assets, and we acquired over 110,000 new clients.\r\nOur industry is changing, and we are increasingly interacting with our clients in the digital world. Currently, almost 5 million clients actively access RBC products and services using our online, mobile or tablet channels, a number which has grown more than 30% since 2012.\r\nWe continue to design new products and services, specifically for online and mobile channels, and are excited about a number of digital product launches that we have planned for the coming year.\r\nTurning to Caribbean Banking. We returned the business to profitability this year through a disciplined strategy, which included exiting noncore markets, taking out costs, and focusing on quality asset growth. I'm pleased that we've been able to achieve these results despite ongoing economic headwinds in the region.\r\nMoving to Insurance. As expected, the impact of new tax legislation reduced earnings this year, but I'm pleased with the underlying performance of the business. We continue to see solid growth in new clients, and our strong client satisfaction scores have been increasingly -- increasing steadily over the years.\r\nTurning to Wealth Management. We had solid underlying earnings, though restructuring activities and market conditions impacted this segment's results. A year ago, we decided to realign and restructure our U.S. and international wealth business and throughout the year, we exited certain regions. These were tough decisions to make, but allow us to better serve ultra and high net worth clients from key centers where we have scale.\r\nMobile Capital Markets were turbulent this year with the volatility index up nearly 20% between May and October. This reflects uncertainty around the timing of a rate hike in the U.S., weakening domestic demand in China, increase in debt crisis and falling commodity prices. As a result, we saw significant repricing in equity markets, particularly in the fourth quarter, where we saw equity markets were down 7% in Canada over the prior quarter.\r\nGlobal Asset Management, our most profitable Wealth Management business, performed well despite the challenging market conditions. Over 75% of our assets under management outperformed their benchmarks over the most recent 3-year period.\r\nGAM is an important growth business for us, particularly as we expand beyond the Canadian retail market. Throughout the year, we added new investment solutions and professionals and expanded our distribution to U.S. and international institutional clients.\r\nWe also continued to successfully integrate BlueBay funds into both the RBC distribution network and throughout the Canadian retail market.\r\nThe Canadian Wealth Management market conditions impacted client assets and results in lower client activity and fewer new issuances, particularly in the second half of the year. However, even in tough markets, we continue to extend our #1 position in the high net worth segment as clients value our team of experienced investment advisers who collaborate with their partners in the retail and insurance businesses to provide a holistic approach to Wealth Management.\r\nOur U.S. wealth business is an important part of our franchise, serving 350,000 households south of the border. The U.S. is our second home market, which is why we made the decision to acquire City National and create a powerful platform for long-term growth.\r\nAs the transaction just closed this month, our focus now is on integrating to bring the best of both organizations to our commercial Capital Markets and Wealth Management clients. We're excited to tell you more about this great franchise, and we're planning a City National Investor Day, which will be held in Toronto on March 4, 2016. We'll be excited to provide additional details in the coming months.\r\nMoving to Investor & Treasury Services. We had a record year with earnings up 26% as market conditions were exceptionally favorable for our clients, particularly in our foreign exchange businesses. Even with a challenging fourth quarter, which Janice will discuss in more detail, I am pleased with the strong performance of this business this year.\r\nTurning to Capital Markets. We had a record year with earnings up 13%. Our strong results demonstrate the success of our strategy to focus on traditional corporate and investment banking and origination activities. Corporate investment banking had record revenue of $3.7 billion.\r\nGlobal M&A activity reached a record high this calendar year, as low borrowing costs and slow organic growth encourage firms to expand through acquisitions. Against this backdrop, we advised our clients on $230 billion of completed M&A transactions and improved our U.S. market share by 200 basis points. We also underwrote more than $520 billion of deals across our equity, debt and lending businesses, up 19% from last year.\r\nDebt issuance activity was also very strong as firms obtained funding in advance of a potential U.S. interest rate hike. We actively supported our clients' financing needs and have particularly strong results in our high-yield business, growing our global market share by 120 basis points. While equity origination revenues were down this year, it was against record results in 2014.\r\nGlobal markets had a very good year with revenue up 15%. This business follows an originate-to-distribute model, and we leveraged our clients' strong issuance activity to drive trading revenue.\r\nCredit spreads widened significantly between July and October. As a result, client activity, particularly in fixed income, declined considerably.\r\nEquity trading continued to be strong, but was down compared to exceptionally high levels in the first half of the year on low issuance activity.\r\nOverall, Capital Markets had a strong year, and we continued to maintain our lead in Canada, grow our business in the U.S. and prudently expand our presence in Europe.\r\nTo wrap up, I'm very pleased with our record results this year. We've grown our core client businesses, refocused some of our underperforming businesses and enhanced our digital capabilities for our clients.\r\nAnd importantly, we've continued to invest for the long term, making the largest acquisition in RBC's history to accelerate our growth in the U.S. market. We met all of our financial performance objectives, and we remain committed to these same objectives going forward. I'm confident that we'll continue to deliver long-term value to our shareholders given the strength of our diversified business model, our strong execution capabilities and our disciplined approach to risk.\r\nI'll now turn it over to Janice to discuss our fourth quarter results.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 7. We had a record quarter with earnings of over $2.5 billion, up $260 million or 11% from last year. Our results reflect solid earnings growth in Capital Markets and Personal & Commercial Banking and improved credit quality, partially offset by lower earnings in Investor & Treasury Services, Insurance and Wealth Management.\r\nThis quarter, we benefited from tax adjustments, mostly in Corporate Support. While tax adjustments are a normal course, they were larger this quarter than we have experienced in recent years. These adjustments reduced our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015. If you add back these adjustments, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 would be at the low end of our target range of 22% to 24%.\r\nWe also had some tax adjustments in Capital Markets that related to our business mix in the current year, which I will explain shortly when I review that segment's results.\r\nCompared to last quarter, earnings increased $118 million or 5%, largely due to the tax adjustments I just mentioned as well as higher earnings and insurance, partially offset by lower earnings in Investor & Treasury Services and Wealth Management.\r\nThis quarter, our ROE was strong at 17.9%, although down from 19% last year, largely reflecting our capital build to fund our acquisition of City National, which closed on November 2. I will also note that this quarter, we incurred transaction costs of $23 million after-tax related to the acquisition.\r\nTurning to capital on Slide 8. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.6%, up 50 basis points from last quarter, reflecting strong internal capital generation and lower risk-weighted assets from effective balance sheet management. As an example, in Capital Markets, we reduced securities inventory and derivatives in some trading portfolios. We also increased the granularity of data to allow for the correct risk-weighting under the advanced approach.\r\nLooking ahead to Q1. We now expect that the closing of City National will impact our CET1 ratio by approximately 75 to 80 basis points, up slightly from our previous estimate, largely due to the impact of foreign exchange translation on risk-weighted assets.\r\nMoving to the performance of our business segments, starting on Slide 9. Personal & Commercial Banking reported earnings of over $1.2 billion, up $119 million or 10% from last year and down $11 million or 1% from last quarter.\r\nCanadian Banking reported earnings of over $1.2 billion, up $17 million or 1% from last year. I remind you that last year's earnings were favorably impacted by net cumulative accounting adjustments of $40 million after-tax. Excluding these adjustments, our Canadian Banking earnings were up $57 million or 5% from last year, reflecting solid volume growth of 6%, including loan growth of 5% and deposit growth of 7%.\r\nOur performance also reflects continued growth in fee-based revenue as strong mutual fund asset growth resulted in higher mutual fund distribution fees, and volume growth drove higher credit card revenue. Solid revenue growth was partially offset by higher technology and staff cost to support business growth. We also had lower spreads, largely in business lending, which continues to be highly competitive.\r\nSequentially, Canadian Banking earnings were down $12 million or 1%. We continued see strong volume growth across most businesses and had lower PCL. Our net interest margin was 2.65%, relatively stable from last quarter and down only 1 basis point. These factors were more than offset by expense growth, largely due to higher marketing and technology cost to support business growth.\r\nAs I've said before, expenses in the fourth quarter are often seasonally higher due to the timing of marketing and other discretionary spend. On a full year basis, our efficiency ratio was 44%, 20 basis points better than last year, and our operating leverage was marginally positive. We remain focused on cost management and believe there's more we can do to drive further efficiencies in this segment.\r\nCaribbean and U.S. Banking had earnings of $43 million, up from a net loss of $59 million last year, reflecting lower PCL and the benefit of cost management initiatives and foreign currency translation. Sequentially, earnings were flat.\r\nTurning to Slide 10. Wealth Management had earnings of $255 million, down $30 million or 11% on both the year-over-year and sequential basis. This quarter, we had lower transaction volumes, reflecting lower client activity and fewer new issuances against the backdrop of unfavorable market conditions, which Dave discussed. In addition, we had an after-tax restructuring charge of $38 million, largely related to the repositioning of our U.S. and International Wealth Management business, which includes the sale of RBC Suisse. The restructuring program is largely complete, although we expect to incur additional costs in Q1 of approximately $20 million to $25 million.\r\nWealth Management assets under management and assets under administration were up 9% and 4%, respectively over last year due to net sales and capital appreciation, partially offset by the impact of business exits as part of our restructuring program.\r\nMoving to Insurance on Slide 11. Net income of $225 million was down $31 million or 12% from last year, largely reflecting the negative impact of a change in Canadian tax legislation, which I've previously discussed. Sequentially, net income was up $52 million or 30% due to favorable actuarial adjustments, reflecting management actions and assumption changes resulting from our annual review as well as lower net claims costs across most Canadian insurance product line.\r\nTurning to Slide 12. Investor & Treasury Services had earnings of $88 million, down $25 million or 22% from last year and down $79 million or 47% from last quarter. As a reminder, this business provides asset services, custody, payments and transaction banking for clients and also provides short-term funding and liquidity management for RBC.\r\nAs Dave mentioned, credit spreads widened considerably during the fourth quarter and as a result, we recognized mark-to-market losses on securities held in our treasury portfolio.\r\nOur treasury portfolio is approximately $70 billion in size. It's composed of high-quality liquid assets with strong credit profiles and approximately 70% of the portfolio is held for trading. The losses in Q4 were relatively modest in the context of the overall portfolio.\r\nSo far in Q1, we're seeing a stabilization and slight improvement in the spreads, which should improve the performance of the portfolio this quarter.\r\nOur client-focused businesses, particularly our foreign exchange business, performed well throughout the year and contributed to record full year results.\r\nI'll also remind you that last quarter, we aligned Investor Services' reporting period and Q3 earnings included an extra month of results, which added $28 million to the segment's earnings.\r\nTurning to Slide 13. Capital Markets had a good quarter in a difficult market environment. Net income of $555 million increased $153 million or 38% from last year, reflecting income tax adjustments related to the current year, strong trading revenue and the positive impact of foreign exchange translation.\r\nIn addition, results last year included a $51 million after-tax charge related to funding valuation adjustments and $46 million after-tax of lower revenue and costs associated with our exit from certain proprietary trading strategies.\r\nSequentially, earnings were up $10 million or 2%, reflecting lower variable compensation, income tax adjustments and higher equity trading revenue, mostly offset by lower origination activity, reflecting fewer client issuances and lower fixed income trading revenue due to unfavorable market condition.\r\nLet me briefly discuss the tax adjustment this quarter. Our tax accrual process is based on a number of assumptions we make throughout the year, including business mix. In Q4, as we had full year earnings, the mix is known, and we determined that we had a higher proportion of taxable income in Canada compared to the U.S. than we did last year. Since Canada has a lower income tax rate relative to the U.S., this contributed to the lower tax expense for Q4. I would point out that our full year tax rate of approximately 30% is in line with our expected run rate for 2015.\r\nBefore I turn it over to Mark, I would like to briefly discuss a few priorities for next year. We continue to focus on managing the trajectory of expense growth against revenue growth in order to achieve full bank operating leverage of 1% to 2%. Let me take a moment to talk about our approach.\r\nAt RBC, we've had an ongoing focus on driving cost efficiencies for over a decade. As we've continued to evolve and mature these capabilities, they are now part of our business-as-usual activity. Our strategy is currently focused on 3 key themes.\r\nFirst, we're reinvesting the client experience through digitization and process optimization. We have been investing in this area for a number of years and as a result, we have been able to grow volumes and enhance our strong client service, while keeping FTE relatively flat.\r\nSecond, we are optimizing our business model by increasing the level of collaboration, globally and across segments, to achieve economies of scale. For example, in Europe, we have created centers of expertise that now support all 3 of our business segments operating in the region, Wealth, Capital Markets and Investor & Treasury Services.\r\nThird, we are simplifying our organizational and operational structures to make them more agile. As part of this initiative, we are running development workshops in which employees across business, IT and functional areas prototype a new product or system within 16 weeks. There are both costs savings and revenue generation opportunities associated with these initiatives as they enable a more agile, cost efficient and innovative organization.\r\nAlso across all of our businesses, we're focused on balance sheet management to optimize capital allocation and improve our competitive position and return.\r\nI will point out that as a result of issuing equity to fund half the purchase price of City National, we expect return on equity dilution of approximately 1% to 2% in the short term. However, we've maintained our medium-term objective for ROE of 18% plus based on our confidence in building back up to that target level over time.\r\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Janice, and good morning. We're pleased with our fourth quarter credit, market risk performance. It reflects the diversification of our portfolios, both in terms of geography and industry, low interest rates, strong employment trends as well as our prudent risk management practices.\r\nTurning to Slide 15. Provisions for credit losses on impaired loans of $275 million or 23 basis points this quarter were relatively flat sequentially, as higher provisions in Capital Markets were largely offset by lower provisions in Personal & Commercial Banking.\r\nGross impaired loans decreased $94 million or 3 basis points this quarter, largely due to lower impairments in Personal & Commercial Banking and a write-off in Capital Markets, partly offset by higher impairments in Wealth Management.\r\nIn Canadian Banking, credit trends were stable. We had provisions of $228 million or 25 basis points, down $10 million or 1 basis point from last quarter due to lower provisions in commercial lending. Gross impaired loans decreased $55 million from last quarter, reflecting lower impaired loans in commercial lending and residential mortgages.\r\nIn Caribbean and U.S. Banking, credit trends improved slightly this quarter, with provisions down $7 million and gross impaired loans down $55 million, reflecting higher collections.\r\nWealth Management's provisions were relatively flat, though gross impaired loans increased $48 million sequentially due to a single account in International Wealth Management, which is fully collateralized. We do not anticipate a provision will be required.\r\nIn Capital Markets, provisions increased $21 million sequentially, spread across 5 accounts, with 2 of these 5 accounts in the oil and gas sector, 1 in the U.S. Drilling & Services sector and the other in the Canadian E&P sector. Gross impaired loans decreased $32 million from last quarter, mainly due to a partial write-off of an account in the oil and gas sector.\r\nLet me provide you with an update of our oil and gas exposure. As you can see on Slide 16, our drawn exposure to the oil and gas sector remained at 1.6% of RBC's total loan book, with our exposure to E&P companies down slightly from last quarter. The majority of this E&P portfolio was borrowing-based facilities.\r\nOver the past couple of months, we've been going through our fall redetermination and it is now largely completed. The price deck we used for the redetermination was down 10% to 15% from the spring. Borrowing bases have reduced, on average, 1% in Canada and 6% in the United States. This has resulted in reduced credit availability for some clients, while others have remained flat or even increased due to asset acquisitions, incremental hedging or the addition of further proven reserves to the borrowing base.\r\nDuring the quarter, we added 8 new names to our energy watch list for closer monitoring. While the energy watch list has increased over the year, primarily as a result of our stress testing earlier in the year, our enterprise watch list has been relatively stable as the number of clients have been removed from the list when loans are repaid or clients are upgraded.\r\nOverall, our portfolio is performing as expected, and we continue to work closely with our clients to help them manage through the sustained period of low oil prices.\r\nTurning to Slide 17. Our Canadian retail portfolio remains stable, but we've noticed some early signs of stress in Alberta, particularly in communities that are more dependent on the oil and gas sector. The unemployment rate in Alberta reached 6.6% in October. And while it remains slightly below the national average of 7%, it is up 2.2% from last year.\r\nOur total retail portfolio in Alberta represents 16% of our total Canadian retail portfolio and is largely secured.\r\nWe've noticed a slight, and I would stress the word slight, upward trend in auto and credit card delinquencies in Alberta. And while they haven't translated into write-offs, we are monitoring the performances of these portfolios. Combined, these 2 portfolios account for less than 2% of our total Canadian retail portfolio.\r\nIn our Canadian credit card portfolio, provisions have steadily improved to 234 basis points, down 9 basis points sequentially.\r\nIn our small business portfolio, as we expect variability from quarter-to-quarter, we've seen a slight increase in provisions, mainly in Ontario.\r\nProvisions in our personal portfolio remain stable from last quarter.\r\nOur residential mortgage portfolio continues to perform well, with provisions of 2 basis points this quarter consistent with our historical performance.\r\nTurning to Slide 18. Our portfolio is geographically diversified and our clients' credit profiles are strong and have remained stable over the past year. Also, many clients are committed to accelerated repayment plans and the debt service ratio is low, reinforcing our confidence in our clients' ability to repay.\r\nWe've seen strong house price growth in a few markets, notably Vancouver and Toronto, driven by the short supply of single-family homes coupled with strong demand. We are monitoring these markets closely.\r\nThe credit trends of our portfolios have remained stable and signs of stress remain isolated and manageable.\r\nTurning to market risk on Slide 19. Global markets volatility had a considerable impact on the first half of the quarter, which resulted in 6 days of trading losses, totaling $17.6 million. In addition, due to the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar and higher equity market volatility, our average value at risk increased $4 million and our average stress value at risk increased by $23 million from last quarter.\r\nSo far, in Q1, we've seen markets stabilize. I would note these VAR and stress VAR levels have reduced back again this quarter.\r\nIn summary, our risk performance in Q4 and fiscal 2015 has remained strong, with metrics still reflecting a benign environment.\r\nLooking ahead, recent market and economic headwinds continue to underpin the more cautious outlook. Should oil prices remain depressed and the unemployment rate rise, we could expect credit provisions to reach more normalized levels in the 30 to 35 basis point range. However, we would also anticipate some positive impacts from low oil prices, the weaker Canadian dollar, and our well-diversified portfolio, which should help offset some of the possible deterioration in the oil and gas loan book and retail loan book of oil-exposed provinces.\r\nWith that, we'll open lines up for Q&A.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Amy Cairncross (Executives)】\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. Presenting to you this morning are Dave McKay, President and Chief Executive Officer; Janice Fukakusa, Chief Administrative Officer and CFO; and Mark Hughes, Chief Risk Officer. Following their comments, we will open the call for questions from analysts. The call is 1-hour long and will end at 9:00 a.m. [Operator Instructions] We will be posting management's remarks on our website shortly after the call.\r\nJoining us for your questions are Doug Guzman, Group Head, Wealth Management and Insurance; Doug McGregor, Group Head, Capital Markets and Investor & Treasury Services; Jennifer Tory, Group Head, Personal & Commercial Banking; Zabeen Hirji, Chief Human Resources Officer; and Bruce Ross, Group Head, Technology and Operations.\r\nAs noted on Slide 2, our comments may contain forward-looking statements, which involve applying assumptions and have inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these statements.\r\nI will now turn the call over to Dave McKay.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: David McKay (Executives)】\nThank you, Amy, and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported record Q4 earnings of over $2.5 billion, up 11% from last year. These results capped off a record year with earnings of $10 billion, up 11% from last year or 9% on an adjusted basis. I'm very proud to say that we're the first Canadian company to earn over $10 billion in a given fiscal year.\r\nWe met all of our financial performance objectives. We grew earnings per share by 12%, we delivered a strong return on equity of 18.6%, and we exited the year with a very strong CET1 ratio of 10.6%. And we increased our quarterly dividend twice during the year, for an annualized dividend increase of 8%, all of which helped drive solid shareholder returns. I'm very pleased with these results, particularly since the macroeconomic environment was more challenging for us and our clients than we expected at the beginning of the year.\r\nI'd like to share my perspective on the full year performance of our business segments. Canadian Banking had a solid year with earnings growth of 5% despite slowing economic conditions, particularly in the first half of the year, which prompted the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates twice. Clients took advantage of the historically low interest rates, and we saw strong growth in residential mortgages with balances up 6% from last year. While the overall market grew, we were able to capture a disproportionate share of the growth due to the success of our employee pricing campaign. In addition, we also saw clients switch out of secured lines of credit and into mortgage products to take advantage of better rates, which also contributed to our mortgage growth. As Mark will discuss, we continued to lend prudently, working directly with our clients to manage their debt.\r\nWe also had excellent growth in our cards business this year, with balances up 7% as we continue to deliver a compelling value proposition to our clients. In fact, RBC ranks #1 in 4 out of 5 categories in a recent Rewards Canada report on travel cards.\r\nWith our strong product offering, including the flagship Avion and WestJet cards, we've opened over 1 million new client accounts over the past 2 years, and we've seen a growing number of clients switch over to RBC cards.\r\nAs a result of technology enhancements we've made to our online sales platform, we've seen a 30% increase in the number of clients purchasing cards through digital channels.\r\nTurning to deposits. We have the #1 franchise in Canada with an industry-leading market share of combined consumer and business deposits. Our successful marketing campaigns drove double-digit growth in core checking volumes this year and attracted a significant number of new clients to RBC.\r\nCore checking accounts were a key anchor product for us, and within the first 3 months, our clients typically expand their relationship with up to 2 or 3 additional products.\r\nOn the business side, deposits were up 10% from last year. Given market uncertainty, many clients wanted to keep their excess funds liquid, and we've supported them through our range of savings products, including a new high-interest account.\r\nMoving to investment products. We continue to see strong client demand despite challenging market conditions this year. Client flows were strong as we leveraged the power of our distribution network and breadth of our product suite to drive 9% growth in mutual fund assets, and we acquired over 110,000 new clients.\r\nOur industry is changing, and we are increasingly interacting with our clients in the digital world. Currently, almost 5 million clients actively access RBC products and services using our online, mobile or tablet channels, a number which has grown more than 30% since 2012.\r\nWe continue to design new products and services, specifically for online and mobile channels, and are excited about a number of digital product launches that we have planned for the coming year.\r\nTurning to Caribbean Banking. We returned the business to profitability this year through a disciplined strategy, which included exiting noncore markets, taking out costs, and focusing on quality asset growth. I'm pleased that we've been able to achieve these results despite ongoing economic headwinds in the region.\r\nMoving to Insurance. As expected, the impact of new tax legislation reduced earnings this year, but I'm pleased with the underlying performance of the business. We continue to see solid growth in new clients, and our strong client satisfaction scores have been increasingly -- increasing steadily over the years.\r\nTurning to Wealth Management. We had solid underlying earnings, though restructuring activities and market conditions impacted this segment's results. A year ago, we decided to realign and restructure our U.S. and international wealth business and throughout the year, we exited certain regions. These were tough decisions to make, but allow us to better serve ultra and high net worth clients from key centers where we have scale.\r\nMobile Capital Markets were turbulent this year with the volatility index up nearly 20% between May and October. This reflects uncertainty around the timing of a rate hike in the U.S., weakening domestic demand in China, increase in debt crisis and falling commodity prices. As a result, we saw significant repricing in equity markets, particularly in the fourth quarter, where we saw equity markets were down 7% in Canada over the prior quarter.\r\nGlobal Asset Management, our most profitable Wealth Management business, performed well despite the challenging market conditions. Over 75% of our assets under management outperformed their benchmarks over the most recent 3-year period.\r\nGAM is an important growth business for us, particularly as we expand beyond the Canadian retail market. Throughout the year, we added new investment solutions and professionals and expanded our distribution to U.S. and international institutional clients.\r\nWe also continued to successfully integrate BlueBay funds into both the RBC distribution network and throughout the Canadian retail market.\r\nThe Canadian Wealth Management market conditions impacted client assets and results in lower client activity and fewer new issuances, particularly in the second half of the year. However, even in tough markets, we continue to extend our #1 position in the high net worth segment as clients value our team of experienced investment advisers who collaborate with their partners in the retail and insurance businesses to provide a holistic approach to Wealth Management.\r\nOur U.S. wealth business is an important part of our franchise, serving 350,000 households south of the border. The U.S. is our second home market, which is why we made the decision to acquire City National and create a powerful platform for long-term growth.\r\nAs the transaction just closed this month, our focus now is on integrating to bring the best of both organizations to our commercial Capital Markets and Wealth Management clients. We're excited to tell you more about this great franchise, and we're planning a City National Investor Day, which will be held in Toronto on March 4, 2016. We'll be excited to provide additional details in the coming months.\r\nMoving to Investor & Treasury Services. We had a record year with earnings up 26% as market conditions were exceptionally favorable for our clients, particularly in our foreign exchange businesses. Even with a challenging fourth quarter, which Janice will discuss in more detail, I am pleased with the strong performance of this business this year.\r\nTurning to Capital Markets. We had a record year with earnings up 13%. Our strong results demonstrate the success of our strategy to focus on traditional corporate and investment banking and origination activities. Corporate investment banking had record revenue of $3.7 billion.\r\nGlobal M&A activity reached a record high this calendar year, as low borrowing costs and slow organic growth encourage firms to expand through acquisitions. Against this backdrop, we advised our clients on $230 billion of completed M&A transactions and improved our U.S. market share by 200 basis points. We also underwrote more than $520 billion of deals across our equity, debt and lending businesses, up 19% from last year.\r\nDebt issuance activity was also very strong as firms obtained funding in advance of a potential U.S. interest rate hike. We actively supported our clients' financing needs and have particularly strong results in our high-yield business, growing our global market share by 120 basis points. While equity origination revenues were down this year, it was against record results in 2014.\r\nGlobal markets had a very good year with revenue up 15%. This business follows an originate-to-distribute model, and we leveraged our clients' strong issuance activity to drive trading revenue.\r\nCredit spreads widened significantly between July and October. As a result, client activity, particularly in fixed income, declined considerably.\r\nEquity trading continued to be strong, but was down compared to exceptionally high levels in the first half of the year on low issuance activity.\r\nOverall, Capital Markets had a strong year, and we continued to maintain our lead in Canada, grow our business in the U.S. and prudently expand our presence in Europe.\r\nTo wrap up, I'm very pleased with our record results this year. We've grown our core client businesses, refocused some of our underperforming businesses and enhanced our digital capabilities for our clients.\r\nAnd importantly, we've continued to invest for the long term, making the largest acquisition in RBC's history to accelerate our growth in the U.S. market. We met all of our financial performance objectives, and we remain committed to these same objectives going forward. I'm confident that we'll continue to deliver long-term value to our shareholders given the strength of our diversified business model, our strong execution capabilities and our disciplined approach to risk.\r\nI'll now turn it over to Janice to discuss our fourth quarter results.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Janice Fukakusa (Executives)】\nThanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 7. We had a record quarter with earnings of over $2.5 billion, up $260 million or 11% from last year. Our results reflect solid earnings growth in Capital Markets and Personal & Commercial Banking and improved credit quality, partially offset by lower earnings in Investor & Treasury Services, Insurance and Wealth Management.\r\nThis quarter, we benefited from tax adjustments, mostly in Corporate Support. While tax adjustments are a normal course, they were larger this quarter than we have experienced in recent years. These adjustments reduced our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015. If you add back these adjustments, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 would be at the low end of our target range of 22% to 24%.\r\nWe also had some tax adjustments in Capital Markets that related to our business mix in the current year, which I will explain shortly when I review that segment's results.\r\nCompared to last quarter, earnings increased $118 million or 5%, largely due to the tax adjustments I just mentioned as well as higher earnings and insurance, partially offset by lower earnings in Investor & Treasury Services and Wealth Management.\r\nThis quarter, our ROE was strong at 17.9%, although down from 19% last year, largely reflecting our capital build to fund our acquisition of City National, which closed on November 2. I will also note that this quarter, we incurred transaction costs of $23 million after-tax related to the acquisition.\r\nTurning to capital on Slide 8. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.6%, up 50 basis points from last quarter, reflecting strong internal capital generation and lower risk-weighted assets from effective balance sheet management. As an example, in Capital Markets, we reduced securities inventory and derivatives in some trading portfolios. We also increased the granularity of data to allow for the correct risk-weighting under the advanced approach.\r\nLooking ahead to Q1. We now expect that the closing of City National will impact our CET1 ratio by approximately 75 to 80 basis points, up slightly from our previous estimate, largely due to the impact of foreign exchange translation on risk-weighted assets.\r\nMoving to the performance of our business segments, starting on Slide 9. Personal & Commercial Banking reported earnings of over $1.2 billion, up $119 million or 10% from last year and down $11 million or 1% from last quarter.\r\nCanadian Banking reported earnings of over $1.2 billion, up $17 million or 1% from last year. I remind you that last year's earnings were favorably impacted by net cumulative accounting adjustments of $40 million after-tax. Excluding these adjustments, our Canadian Banking earnings were up $57 million or 5% from last year, reflecting solid volume growth of 6%, including loan growth of 5% and deposit growth of 7%.\r\nOur performance also reflects continued growth in fee-based revenue as strong mutual fund asset growth resulted in higher mutual fund distribution fees, and volume growth drove higher credit card revenue. Solid revenue growth was partially offset by higher technology and staff cost to support business growth. We also had lower spreads, largely in business lending, which continues to be highly competitive.\r\nSequentially, Canadian Banking earnings were down $12 million or 1%. We continued see strong volume growth across most businesses and had lower PCL. Our net interest margin was 2.65%, relatively stable from last quarter and down only 1 basis point. These factors were more than offset by expense growth, largely due to higher marketing and technology cost to support business growth.\r\nAs I've said before, expenses in the fourth quarter are often seasonally higher due to the timing of marketing and other discretionary spend. On a full year basis, our efficiency ratio was 44%, 20 basis points better than last year, and our operating leverage was marginally positive. We remain focused on cost management and believe there's more we can do to drive further efficiencies in this segment.\r\nCaribbean and U.S. Banking had earnings of $43 million, up from a net loss of $59 million last year, reflecting lower PCL and the benefit of cost management initiatives and foreign currency translation. Sequentially, earnings were flat.\r\nTurning to Slide 10. Wealth Management had earnings of $255 million, down $30 million or 11% on both the year-over-year and sequential basis. This quarter, we had lower transaction volumes, reflecting lower client activity and fewer new issuances against the backdrop of unfavorable market conditions, which Dave discussed. In addition, we had an after-tax restructuring charge of $38 million, largely related to the repositioning of our U.S. and International Wealth Management business, which includes the sale of RBC Suisse. The restructuring program is largely complete, although we expect to incur additional costs in Q1 of approximately $20 million to $25 million.\r\nWealth Management assets under management and assets under administration were up 9% and 4%, respectively over last year due to net sales and capital appreciation, partially offset by the impact of business exits as part of our restructuring program.\r\nMoving to Insurance on Slide 11. Net income of $225 million was down $31 million or 12% from last year, largely reflecting the negative impact of a change in Canadian tax legislation, which I've previously discussed. Sequentially, net income was up $52 million or 30% due to favorable actuarial adjustments, reflecting management actions and assumption changes resulting from our annual review as well as lower net claims costs across most Canadian insurance product line.\r\nTurning to Slide 12. Investor & Treasury Services had earnings of $88 million, down $25 million or 22% from last year and down $79 million or 47% from last quarter. As a reminder, this business provides asset services, custody, payments and transaction banking for clients and also provides short-term funding and liquidity management for RBC.\r\nAs Dave mentioned, credit spreads widened considerably during the fourth quarter and as a result, we recognized mark-to-market losses on securities held in our treasury portfolio.\r\nOur treasury portfolio is approximately $70 billion in size.

Capital Markets had a good quarter in a difficult market environment. Net income of $555 million increased $153 million or 38% from last year, reflecting income tax adjustments related to the current year, strong trading revenue and the positive impact of foreign exchange translation.\r\nIn addition, results last year included a $51 million after-tax charge related to funding valuation adjustments and $46 million after-tax of lower revenue and costs associated with our exit from certain proprietary trading strategies.\r\nSequentially, earnings were up $10 million or 2%, reflecting lower variable compensation, income tax adjustments and higher equity trading revenue, mostly offset by lower origination activity, reflecting fewer client issuances and lower fixed income trading revenue due to unfavorable market condition.\r\nLet me briefly discuss the tax adjustment this quarter. Our tax accrual process is based on a number of assumptions we make throughout the year, including business mix. In Q4, as we had full year earnings, the mix is known, and we determined that we had a higher proportion of taxable income in Canada compared to the U.S. than we did last year. Since Canada has a lower income tax rate relative to the U.S., this contributed to the lower tax expense for Q4. I would point out that our full year tax rate of approximately 30% is in line with our expected run rate for 2015.\r\nBefore I turn it over to Mark, I would like to briefly discuss a few priorities for next year.

However, we've maintained our medium-term objective for ROE of 18% plus based on our confidence in building back up to that target level over time.\r\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Hughes (Executives)】\nThank you, Janice, and good morning. We're pleased with our fourth quarter credit, market risk performance. It reflects the diversification of our portfolios, both in terms of geography and industry, low interest rates, strong employment trends as well as our prudent risk management practices.\r\nTurning to Slide 15. Provisions for credit losses on impaired loans of $275 million or 23 basis points this quarter were relatively flat sequentially, as higher provisions in Capital Markets were largely offset by lower provisions in Personal & Commercial Banking.\r\nGross impaired loans decreased $94 million or 3 basis points this quarter, largely due to lower impairments in Personal & Commercial Banking and a write-off in Capital Markets, partly offset by higher impairments in Wealth Management.\r\nIn Canadian Banking, credit trends were stable. We had provisions of $228 million or 25 basis points, down $10 million or 1 basis point from last quarter due to lower provisions in commercial lending. Gross impaired loans decreased $55 million from last quarter, reflecting lower impaired loans in commercial lending and residential mortgages.\r\nIn Caribbean and U.S. Banking, credit trends improved slightly this quarter, with provisions down $7 million and gross impaired loans down $55 million, reflecting higher collections.\r\nWealth Management's provisions were relatively flat, though gross impaired loans increased $48 million sequentially due to a single account in International Wealth Management, which is fully collateralized. We do not anticipate a provision will be required.\r\nIn Capital Markets, provisions increased $21 million sequentially, spread across 5 accounts, with 2 of these 5 accounts in the oil and gas sector, 1 in the U.S. Drilling & Services sector and the other in the Canadian E&P sector. Gross impaired loans decreased $32 million from last quarter, mainly due to a partial write-off of an account in the oil and gas sector.\r\nLet me provide you with an update of our oil and gas exposure. As you can see on Slide 16, our drawn exposure to the oil and gas sector remained at 1.6% of RBC's total loan book, with our exposure to E&P companies down slightly from last quarter. The majority of this E&P portfolio was borrowing-based facilities.\r\nOver the past couple of months, we've been going through our fall redetermination and it is now largely completed. The price deck we used for the redetermination was down 10% to 15% from the spring. Borrowing bases have reduced, on average, 1% in Canada and 6% in the United States. This has resulted in reduced credit availability for some clients, while others have remained flat or even increased due to asset acquisitions, incremental hedging or the addition of further proven reserves to the borrowing base.\r\nDuring the quarter, we added 8 new names to our energy watch list for closer monitoring. While the energy watch list has increased over the year, primarily as a result of our stress testing earlier in the year, our enterprise watch list has been relatively stable as the number of clients have been removed from the list when loans are repaid or clients are upgraded.\r\nOverall, our portfolio is performing as expected, and we continue to work closely with our clients to help them manage through the sustained period of low oil prices.\r\nTurning to Slide 17. Our Canadian retail portfolio remains stable, but we've noticed some early signs of stress in Alberta, particularly in communities that are more dependent on the oil and gas sector. The unemployment rate in Alberta reached 6.6% in October. And while it remains slightly below the national average of 7%, it is up 2.2% from last year.\r\nOur total retail portfolio in Alberta represents 16% of our total Canadian retail portfolio and is largely secured.\r\nWe've noticed a slight, and I would stress the word slight, upward trend in auto and credit card delinquencies in Alberta. And while they haven't translated into write-offs, we are monitoring the performances of these portfolios. Combined, these 2 portfolios account for less than 2% of our total Canadian retail portfolio.\r\nIn our Canadian credit card portfolio, provisions have steadily improved to 234 basis points, down 9 basis points sequentially.\r\nIn our small business portfolio, as we expect variability from quarter-to-quarter, we've seen a slight increase in provisions, mainly in Ontario.\r\nProvisions in our personal portfolio remain stable from last quarter.\r\nOur residential mortgage portfolio continues to perform well, with provisions of 2 basis points this quarter consistent with our historical performance.\r\nTurning to Slide 18. Our portfolio is geographically diversified and our clients' credit profiles are strong and have remained stable over the past year. Also, many clients are committed to accelerated repayment plans and the debt service ratio is low, reinforcing our confidence in our clients' ability to repay.\r\nWe've seen strong house price growth in a few markets, notably Vancouver and Toronto, driven by the short supply of single-family homes coupled with strong demand. We are monitoring these markets closely.\r\nThe credit trends of our portfolios have remained stable and signs of stress remain isolated and manageable.\r\nTurning to market risk on Slide 19. Global markets volatility had a considerable impact on the first half of the quarter, which resulted in 6 days of trading losses, totaling $17.6 million. In addition, due to the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar and higher equity market volatility, our average value at risk increased $4 million and our average stress value at risk increased by $23 million from last quarter.\r\nSo far, in Q1, we've seen markets stabilize. I would note these VAR and stress VAR levels have reduced back again this quarter.\r\nIn summary, our risk performance in Q4 and fiscal 2015 has remained strong, with metrics still reflecting a benign environment.\r\nLooking ahead, recent market and economic headwinds continue to underpin the more cautious outlook. Should oil prices remain depressed and the unemployment rate rise, we could expect credit provisions to reach more normalized levels in the 30 to 35 basis point range. However, we would also anticipate some positive impacts from low oil prices, the weaker Canadian dollar, and our well-diversified portfolio, which should help offset some of the possible deterioration in the oil and gas loan book and retail loan book of oil-exposed provinces.\r\nWith that, we'll open lines up for Q&A.",
      "transcript_text3": "I have a couple of questions on capital after some somewhat stubborn CET1 trends. You got a nice lift this quarter. So when I look at the RWA schedule, there seems to be a lot of categories that are down, admittedly some of the larger drivers look to be the repo line, the derivative line, you touched on that, Janice, thanks for that color. But could we get a little bit more detail and may be split it out, is there any model assumption changes or model enhancements or approvals? Pretty unusual to see RWA going down. And then maybe more importantly, is there anything on slate for next year on the horizon in terms of model enhancements or anything you expect to help you on the RWA front going forward as you absorb City National?\n\n---\n\nSteve, thanks for the question. I think that it was pretty straightforward this quarter in terms of all of our efforts around balance sheet optimization. When you asked about potential for -- other than looking more carefully at what's happening with our various categories like securities and derivatives, if there are any model changes, we haven't had anything of significance. What you saw is the data cleanup. So we had some of the items that were lumped all together and we actually cleaned it up into the various underlying categories, so that we could get advanced Basel II.5 treatment for those particular exposures. Going forward, we expect the ongoing back-and-forth about credit models and model review that we do from time to time, but what you see here is the result of various solid balance sheet optimization and balance sheet management across all of our businesses.\n\n---\n\nOn the derivative side, is any of the derivative components related to unwinding any of the dividend rental trades?\n\n---\n\nNo, not at all.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just on capital as well. Are you able, at this point to -- the SIFI announcement obviously came and went in November? Are you in a position at this point to provide the SIFI score for the year that I think we got Q1 last year, but wondering if you have that any earlier?\n\n---\n\nWe don't have that information available from Basel, but the minute that we have it, we'll definitely provide it. But we're -- obviously, we were below the 130 cut off that Basel was using.\n\n---\n\nJust to piggyback off that question regarding some of the decline in risk-weighted assets. It did seem to be, in part, related to what I would consider to be more capital market type items, so probably for Doug. When we think about some of this balance sheet repurposing, to use that -- if I can use that term, do you foresee this having any impact on revenue trends for the bank going forward? And if not, I guess, the natural question would be, what was the -- what was the benefit of having these assets in the first place?\n\n---\n\nIt's Doug. I think, first of all, I'll take you through where some of the reductions came in Capital Markets. It came in fixed income and some of the portfolios that we were looking at were credit portfolios in the U.S., in particular, and some of our securitization portfolios. So when Janice talks about optimization, what we're really doing is trying to figure out where we're getting proper returns on GAA and RWA, and we looked at those portfolios in particular and took some assets off. I would say also in the leverage lending part of our business, we weren't as active last quarter as we have been over the last year or so. And frankly, that worked out pretty well for us given the performance of credit markets. So I think going forward, we have a business plan. We obviously work with Janice and the rest of the bank on capital allocation and the bank expects to generate more capital as the year goes on through retained earnings. And so we think that we'll have the capital we need to grow the business.\n\n---\n\nAnd the question regarding net income, I mean, is, in your view, the pullback from some of these businesses, should we contemplate any kind of material change in the earnings profile of your segment?\n\n---\n\nNo. One of the reasons we took assets off where we did, there is some -- in the fixed income business, in particular, things are reasonably difficult in certain parts of those trading books. And so I wouldn't expect that that's going to have a significant run rate change to our business. The other thing that's happened, and I think it might be in the [indiscernible], that the legacy book has been running off pretty vigorously.\n\n---\n\nSome of the old level 3 type stuff?\n\n---\n\nYes. And so there's been a significant run-off over the course of the year and the last half of the year.\n\n---\n\nSo Janice talked on -- touched on all bank operating leverage and the hopes for next year. I wonder if we can get a little bit more color perhaps from Jennifer on the Canadian segment specifically. I'm curious on the quarter how much of it was just seasonally elevated expenses versus sort of structural spending that has to happen, and perhaps, what the prospects are for your segment, in particular, as we look into next year?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Rob, for the question. Overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made managing expenses. And on a full year basis, our efficiency ratio was 44% and actually, we've improved the ratio by 70 basis points over the past 2 years. Operating leverage was 0.4, notwithstanding margin compression. I think that's an important thing to note. And in addition, we reduced our headcount in Canadian Banking by 528 FTE this year, mostly through attrition and a similar number last year. The expenses this quarter were up 3%, largely driven, as was pointed out, by some of the seasonal timing of marketing and particularly higher technology-related costs. We're continuing to invest in our digital channels, as Dave mentioned, and also to invest in automating and simplifying our processes to improve the paying points for our clients and our employees. We're obviously continuing to manage our overall costs given the margin conditions as we want to continue to invest in the business. So we're going to continue to target operating leverage of 1% to 2% for the full year and drive our efficiency ratio further down over the medium term, notwithstanding the challenging interest rate environment. But reminder that through the year, the seasonal factors impacting revenue and expense trends can create fluctuations in operating leverage and efficiency ratio.\n\n---\n\nDo you think that kind of operating leverage is attainable over a medium term when you've already got a 44% efficiency ratio. How far down do you think that ratio can go?\n\n---\n\nYes, because as even Janice pointed out, we think there are more efficiencies through technology investments that we can gain. The challenge is really going to be on the revenue side given margin compression.\n\n---\n\nRob, it’s Dave here. I would add that if you look at the interest rate environment of absolute low rates, but very high prime BA spreads, that plays against the construct of our balance sheet more than any other bank on the street, given the very high core deposit base that we have and the relatively high proportion of fixed-rate mortgages that we have. So that creates a more difficult revenue environment. As you start to see that shift in the last couple of months towards higher base rates, slightly higher base rates as BAs go up and compression, as Jennifer just mentioned, of your prime BA spreads, which really affects your variable rate lending book, that plays a little bit more into our strength than others. So it's been a difficult year balance sheet-wise as far as margin compression for Jennifer's business as she mentioned from an overall macro weak environment, rates environment, but also from a competitive environment that should alleviate a little bit going forward. So that was one of the reasons why revenues compressed. We like the structure of our balance sheet with very strong core deposits and our deposit funding ratios being the strongest on the -- among the banks. It just didn't play into the rate environment as well of a fairly unique macro rate environment last year.\n\n---\n\nJust wanted to ask a quick one of Doug, if you can talk -- we got some color from Janice, but if you can talk about the current quarter trading conditions, how those are progressing compared to the quarter we just had? And then, the next one would be for either Dave or Janice. A few of your peers with big U.S. businesses have given -- have quantified the sensitivity of their earnings to increases in U.S. rates. As you acquired City National and rolled out, you gave some guidance when you acquired City National about their rate sensitivity, but how does it fit into the overall business. Is there like a broad sensitivity you can give us that we can...\n\n---\n\nOkay, it's Doug. I'll start with the current quarter. I would say that the business environment overall is much more constructive than it was last quarter. I mean, last quarter, we had an equity market where it was very difficult issue into. We had clients' shares reducing in value. They weren't interested in selling at levels that the shares got to and probably more importantly, credit markets, especially high yield in the U.S. was quite difficult. So we're seeing a nice repairing in equities and firming up on the credit side. So the business, the new issue business is going better, Hydro One being an example. We've also had some good wins on the M&A side. We've done -- we've had a nice win in the U.S. and Australia over the last 2 or 3 weeks. So it's considerably better than it was in August, September.\n\n---\n\nIt's Dave here. We've had a month now with City National, and we're really excited about the momentum that the business had coming into the close of the transaction on November 1 with their balance sheet growth, and their client growth has been absolutely exceptional, and we spent the better part of the month starting to launch our synergy programs. But as you point out, one of the largest synergies in this transaction, and we'll spend a lot more time on this in the Investor Day in March, is the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet to a higher U.S. rate environment. That was a big part of the trajectory of the earnings that we saw. I can refer you back to a September disclosure by City National where they disclosed some of the asset sensitivity of their current balance sheet that they had at the end, I believe, of -- at least it was Q2. And they disclosed that in a rate environment that goes up 200 basis points, as you bleed those higher rates into that portfolio, by the end of the second year, they disclosed an asset sensitivity of U.S. $279 million. So very significant sensitivity. I think that's beyond what we disclosed in January. So again, reflecting both the accelerated growth of the balance sheet and the client success they're having, and the short duration of their asset profile leads to very significant asset sensitivity in the context of their overall current earnings structure. So a very exciting part of the synergies and the trajectory of this business, USD 279 million.\n\n---\n\nWhat about -- how would that compare to the existing Royal business. I know -- is it similar? Is it more? Just trying to get a sense of the full picture, not just City National?\n\n---\n\nRight. Great question. So we do have a significant amount of suite deposits on our U.S. Wealth Management franchise, that would, as we unlock the value of those, and again, we require the City National acquisition to really get after the use of those deposits and unlock the true value of those suites over time. But certainly that deposit base would have an asset sensitivity. I don't think we've disclosed that and calculated that. Again, it's a meaningful part of the overall earnings potential of our existing U.S. Wealth franchise. So when you combine the 2 businesses together, they both bring fairly material asset sensitivity and interest rate increase earnings potential to ROI.\n\n---\n\nI think it would be helpful if once it's settled down into integration a little bit, you can give us a bit of a picture there and some rules of thumb for 25 or 100 basis point shift. That keep it simple stupid stuff, we like that.\n\n---\n\nJust on the Wealth Management business, and I think, Janice, you mentioned a few points, just I think you mentioned, there is a $21 million, correct me if I'm wrong, restructuring charge coming in Q1. Just wondering, because I thought that was going to be done at the tail end of this year, just wondering what's dragging in to next year? And are we done? And then more broadly on Wealth Management, if I exclude the restructuring charge, I think and correct me if I'm wrong, earnings increase 3% year-over-year, but obviously, your assets were up quite nicely, and I think you've had less transactional activity and [indiscernible] activity or something as such. If you can just enlighten me and maybe kind of guide me in terms of how to think about modeling out or thinking about earnings growth? And then maybe in the same context, what does City National add to that potential in the wealth business?\n\n---\n\nOkay, great question, Doug. So what I said about the remainder of the restructuring, it would be about $20 million to $25 million of additional expense after-tax that we'd be taking in Q1. And it is in relation to the fact that we're going as fast as we can, but it's a big and complex project. So there was some overhang into the next fiscal year. If you look at our core Wealth Management earnings and to some degree adjust out a lot of the noise that's happening, we do believe that despite the fact that markets did turn down towards the end of the year, that there was earnings growth on -- in our core businesses in Wealth Management. And we think that as we go through the next year, you'll see more of that core earnings growth because of less of a preoccupation on what we've been doing around International Wealth Management.\n\n---\n\nSo it's Doug, I can add to Janice's comments as well. I think what's been previously disclosed in relation to that restructuring program is that we were largely complete, and so this is moving along that spectrum and is consistent with our expectations for the overall execution of the program. If you'd look back to when we started, our estimate of the cost and timing has been very accurate, it's been quite -- quite well-executed. So you shouldn't view the $20 million to $25 million as additional to what was anticipated before, but rather as Janice said, sort of completion of the last set of activities that are currently contemplated. Part of my job is to come in and take a fresh look at things. So I'll be doing that. But you -- the whole business, but you should regard that program as having been well executed and the last bit is pretty much the completion of what we had talked about before.\n\n---\n\nAnd Doug, with respect to your question, how does City National fit into overall Wealth Management? We decided to organize around one client, which is the high net worth, ultra-high net worth client in the U.S., putting together our existing U.S. wealth franchise with the City National franchise who serves a very similar customer on the wealth side. In addition, City National serves a very strong commercial customer and links those 2 together, and that organizing philosophy around 1 bank, 1 client is consistent with how we think about our franchise globally, particularly in Canada. So given the client they serve, it belongs in the wealth franchise and we'll roll up overall to our Global Wealth business because of the customer franchise that it serves. So that's where it belongs for now, and that's how it's going to be managed. Russell will report in to myself directly, but the results will show up in the consolidated Global Wealth segment.\n\n---\n\nAnd when I think about looking forward, should we expect the margins that have to -- and I believe it's the case, but is there potential for margin improvement in wealth as you integrate the City National, is that the way to think about it?\n\n---\n\nCertainly with respect to our U.S. wealth business, as we look to expand our client wallet and increase the revenue, for sure, and then we look at cost efficiencies from a functional side across the 2 businesses, they're both primary opportunities. But this is, first and foremost, a revenue growth strategy and a cross-sell in deeper client relationships with a larger product shelf. Secondary, it's leveraging the suite and cash deposits that are in the wealth franchise tertiary, it's a cost opportunity across the infrastructure side. So yes, in that order.\n\n---\n\nMaybe Dave or Janice. When you look at the financial targets that you have, and as we think ahead, what's the basis for example for the EPS growth target, is it the $10 billion? Or is it an adjusted number that's lower? Or how should I think about the atypical movements in the business mix this quarter of Capital Markets and the corporate segment?\n\n---\n\nRight. I think -- good question, Sohrab. I think that when you look at our target for EPS growth, it's obviously going to be impacted by the share issuance we did on acquisition of City National. The basis for -- so I would -- we also look at sort of the EPS growth target as a proxy for earnings growth target going forward in the medium term, and so it would be growth based on where we sit today and what is achievable in the medium term. So that would be the basis given our current trajectories and how we look at the medium term in terms of our outlook, our business mix, taking into consideration the things Dave talked about, about the growth potential we have with, for example, City National and our solid performance in all of our underlying segments, we believe we can achieve the medium-term objectives as set out in our annual report. But there will be some pressure on EPS, definitely, in the short run because of the issuance.\n\n---\n\nGreat. I mean, just to be clear, Janice, and I'm not suggesting this is an annual target, but if we were going to start the measurement period today and look ahead, the starting point is the $9.9 billion adjusted net income?\n\n---\n\nYes. That's where -- how we're looking at it. And these are absolutely not annual financial targets. They are about the medium term. As you know, there is movement without, and that's why we look at a medium-term objective and not setting annual guidance.\n\n---\n\nPerfect, and that's very helpful. Now maybe this one is, again, for Dave or Janice. When you think about this medium-term target, if you think over the next, I don't know, couple of years, where do you think the primary driver of the leverage is going to come from, is it going to be on the revenue line? Or is it going to be on the expense line?\n\n---\n\nI would say it'd have to come from both. It's a good question, and we're certainly excited about the growth opportunities of our Capital Markets opportunity -- Capital Markets franchise and our wealth franchise with City National in the U.S. and capitalizing on a strong U.S. market so that presents very strong revenue growth opportunity. We have a very balanced and strong Canadian franchise, whether the growth is in on the wealth side, commercial side, Capital Markets or consumer, we are poised from a business perspective, from a geographic perspective, to capture that growth in Canada, we've demonstrated that over a decade now, so -- and we feel strongly about that. So when you look at our ability to grow where we see the pockets of growth globally, we feel very strongly, particularly with our North American franchise and in an emerging business that Doug is building with ITS and Capital Markets in Europe, albeit that could be a more prolonged play of economic recovery, but we're certainly investing for that long-term play. So that really is where we look at the revenue side. There is an enormous opportunity digitally to look at efficiencies to streamline customer processes to redeploy our employees into higher value-added activities. So that's an ongoing, longer term secular opportunity to become more efficient. And the last thing I would add is, you look at the delta on earnings from an interest rate increase, on our Canadian balance sheet, it's significant, with the largest, as I talked about in my speech, core deposit franchise on the consumer and business side that is seeing historically low compression in margins. As that accelerates in an eventual rising rate environment, that also gives us confidence in our long-term trajectory to meet those earnings objectives. So I think you look at diversification, you look at our growth strategy in the U.S., you look at our ability to use technology, and you look at our balance sheet and our core deposit franchise, they are all reasons to be positive about these medium-term objectives.\n\n---\n\nDuring the prepared remarks, you noted signs of stress in Alberta, and I'm not sure if I missed it, but I was wondering if you could kind of clarify what you're referring to, what you're seeing in the province?\n\n---\n\nYes, certainly, it's Mark here. I guess, I'd point to 2 things. One, as I've said throughout the year, one of the early warning signals we monitor is unemployment and unemployment has moved up. So that is obviously an economic impact for the -- for all of us in the province. And then the second point I mentioned is we did see some slight uptick in delinquencies in our card portfolio. I would say that that's quite slight, it is less than 1% of our outstandings in our Alberta card portfolio, but because we are watching so closely, we did notice it, so we will now continue to monitor that going forward.\n\n---\n\nAnd I'm wondering going to the expense side, a lot of discussion there, definitely technology spending is in focus for Canadian banks and globally, and I'm wondering from your perspective, do you have any sense that -- does Royal Bank have an advantage when it comes to technology spending in the current environment? I mean, we tend to think of scale as being important to your -- do you believe that that is still an important factor in terms of being able to handle these expenses better relative to peers? Are there any other factors that would suggest that Royal has an advantage when it comes to meeting these significant challenges when it comes to technology spending?\n\n---\n\nI would say there're 2 things that favor us. One, we started this journey probably earlier than many of our peers, almost 7 or 8 years ago, and have been on a legacy system replacement technology build over a prolonged period of time, whether it's the retail credit transformation project, commercial projects, and we started this a while ago. So we sequence this over a period of time and got some of the big projects out of the way and are allowed to -- are enabled to focus more on the digital projects now. So I think -- I've talked about that many times over the last 5 years, and we feel that we've gotten a lot of heavy lifting done, but we've got a significant amount of work to do where others may be playing catch-up on both those fronts. Second thing is scale. I mean technology cost for all of us is probably less for us with our purchasing power, but let's say it's even the same when the size of our income statement and our revenue line allows us to spend more than our competitors, and it's going to cost us the same to deliver many of these apps in the digital world or back-office technology integrations or digital processes. So I'd say, timing and scale are advantages.\n\n---\n\nProbably a question for Janice. There's always a lot of talk about the level of capital, but I want to ask a question about the cost of capital, particularly nonequity capital. You may have noticed there was a pressure issuance by one of your peers where we saw widening by about 2x on spreads. NVCC subdebt spreads are wider by 90 basis points, next couple of years we'll have bail-in, that's probably going to raise your long-term deposit funding cost by 20 to 40 basis points. I guess you are going to pass this along to customers or shareholders, and I suspect more of it will go to customers. So what are -- do you think that's right? Am I right in that assessment? And secondly, if so what are the implications for Canadian credit quality as loan yields move up?\n\n---\n\nSo that's a good question, Peter, because you would have seen from our perspective that we do a lot of funding in the markets and when we do funding, we try to fund 3 to 6 months ahead of our requirements so that we don't get caught in pricing pressures and have to replace that funding. And when we look at our own funding spread because of where credit markets have been, they've widened out, but with our base we are still funding pretty much below the AA- equivalence of other financial service companies. I think that as we get more clarity around bail-in, we will have more clarity around the debt ratings. I think that that is a bit of an overhang for all of the Canadian issuers in terms of determining what the bail-in triggers are and that sort of stuff, but from our perspective, we are well aware of the potential for funding cost to drift up, and that's why we are totally focused on balance sheet optimization, looking at the correct returns and making sure that we are never caught short in terms of our own funding needs, and that we can satisfy them well in advance of when we have the requirements. So I think that's how we look at the funding equation with all of the uncertainties.\n\n---\n\nI want to thank everyone for joining us this morning, and also for your support and engagement over the past year as we've had very constructive dialogue and certainly appreciate your questions. And I'd like to take this opportunity at this part of the season to wish you and your families all the very best for a safe and happy holiday season. We'll see you in Q1. Thanks very much.",

But we're -- obviously, we were below the 130 cut off that Basel was using.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sumit Malhotra (Analysts)】\nJust to piggyback off that question regarding some of the decline in risk-weighted assets. It did seem to be, in part, related to what I would consider to be more capital market type items, so probably for Doug. When we think about some of this balance sheet repurposing, to use that -- if I can use that term, do you foresee this having any impact on revenue trends for the bank going forward? And if not, I guess, the natural question would be, what was the -- what was the benefit of having these assets in the first place?\n\n---\n\n【回答: A. McGregor (Executives)】\nIt's Doug. I think, first of all, I'll take you through where some of the reductions came in Capital Markets. It came in fixed income and some of the portfolios that we were looking at were credit portfolios in the U.S., in particular, and some of our securitization portfolios. So when Janice talks about optimization, what we're really doing is trying to figure out where we're getting proper returns on GAA and RWA, and we looked at those portfolios in particular and took some assets off. I would say also in the leverage lending part of our business, we weren't as active last quarter as we have been over the last year or so. And frankly, that worked out pretty well for us given the performance of credit markets. So I think going forward, we have a business plan. We obviously work with Janice and the rest of the bank on capital allocation and the bank expects to generate more capital as the year goes on through retained earnings. And so we think that we'll have the capital we need to grow the business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sumit Malhotra (Analysts)】\nAnd the question regarding net income, I mean, is, in your view, the pullback from some of these businesses, should we contemplate any kind of material change in the earnings profile of your segment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: A. McGregor (Executives)】\nNo. One of the reasons we took assets off where we did, there is some -- in the fixed income business, in particular, things are reasonably difficult in certain parts of those trading books. And so I wouldn't expect that that's going to have a significant run rate change to our business. The other thing that's happened, and I think it might be in the [indiscernible], that the legacy book has been running off pretty vigorously.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sumit Malhotra (Analysts)】\nSome of the old level 3 type stuff?\n\n---\n\n【回答: A. McGregor (Executives)】\nYes. And so there's been a significant run-off over the course of the year and the last half of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Sedran (Analysts)】\nSo Janice talked on -- touched on all bank operating leverage and the hopes for next year. I wonder if we can get a little bit more color perhaps from Jennifer on the Canadian segment specifically. I'm curious on the quarter how much of it was just seasonally elevated expenses versus sort of structural spending that has to happen, and perhaps, what the prospects are for your segment, in particular, as we look into next year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jennifer Tory (Executives)】\nThanks, Rob, for the question. Overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made managing expenses. And on a full year basis, our efficiency ratio was 44% and actually, we've improved the ratio by 70 basis points over the past 2 years. Operating leverage was 0.4, notwithstanding margin compression. I think that's an important thing to note. And in addition, we reduced our headcount in Canadian Banking by 528 FTE this year, mostly through attrition and a similar number last year. The expenses this quarter were up 3%, largely driven, as was pointed out, by some of the seasonal timing of marketing and particularly higher technology-related costs. We're continuing to invest in our digital channels, as Dave mentioned, and also to invest in automating and simplifying our processes to improve the paying points for our clients and our employees. We're obviously continuing to manage our overall costs given the margin conditions as we want to continue to invest in the business. So we're going to continue to target operating leverage of 1% to 2% for the full year and drive our efficiency ratio further down over the medium term, notwithstanding the challenging interest rate environment. But reminder that through the year, the seasonal factors impacting revenue and expense trends can create fluctuations in operating leverage and efficiency ratio.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Sedran (Analysts)】\nDo you think that kind of operating leverage is attainable over a medium term when you've already got a 44% efficiency ratio. How far down do you think that ratio can go?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jennifer Tory (Executives)】\nYes, because as even Janice pointed out, we think there are more efficiencies through technology investments that we can gain. The challenge is really going to be on the revenue side given margin compression.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David McKay (Executives)】\nRob, it’s Dave here. I would add that if you look at the interest rate environment of absolute low rates, but very high prime BA spreads, that plays against the construct of our balance sheet more than any other bank on the street, given the very high core deposit base that we have and the relatively high proportion of fixed-rate mortgages that we have. So that creates a more difficult revenue environment. As you start to see that shift in the last couple of months towards higher base rates, slightly higher base rates as BAs go up and compression, as Jennifer just mentioned, of your prime BA spreads, which really affects your variable rate lending book, that plays a little bit more into our strength than others. So it's been a difficult year balance sheet-wise as far as margin compression for Jennifer's business as she mentioned from an overall macro weak environment, rates environment, but also from a competitive environment that should alleviate a little bit going forward. So that was one of the reasons why revenues compressed. We like the structure of our balance sheet with very strong core deposits and our deposit funding ratios being the strongest on the -- among the banks. It just didn't play into the rate environment as well of a fairly unique macro rate environment last year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gabriel Dechaine (Analysts)】\nJust wanted to ask a quick one of Doug, if you can talk -- we got some color from Janice, but if you can talk about the current quarter trading conditions, how those are progressing compared to the quarter we just had? And then, the next one would be for either Dave or Janice. A few of your peers with big U.S. businesses have given -- have quantified the sensitivity of their earnings to increases in U.S. rates. As you acquired City National and rolled out, you gave some guidance when you acquired City National about their rate sensitivity, but how does it fit into the overall business. Is there like a broad sensitivity you can give us that we can...\n\n---\n\n【回答: A. McGregor (Executives)】\nOkay, it's Doug. I'll start with the current quarter. I would say that the business environment overall is much more constructive than it was last quarter. I mean, last quarter, we had an equity market where it was very difficult issue into. We had clients' shares reducing in value. They weren't interested in selling at levels that the shares got to and probably more importantly, credit markets, especially high yield in the U.S. was quite difficult. So we're seeing a nice repairing in equities and firming up on the credit side. So the business, the new issue business is going better, Hydro One being an example. We've also had some good wins on the M&A side. We've done -- we've had a nice win in the U.S. and Australia over the last 2 or 3 weeks. So it's considerably better than it was in August, September.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David McKay (Executives)】\nIt's Dave here. We've had a month now with City National, and we're really excited about the momentum that the business had coming into the close of the transaction on November 1 with their balance sheet growth, and their client growth has been absolutely exceptional, and we spent the better part of the month starting to launch our synergy programs. But as you point out, one of the largest synergies in this transaction, and we'll spend a lot more time on this in the Investor Day in March, is the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet to a higher U.S. rate environment. That was a big part of the trajectory of the earnings that we saw. I can refer you back to a September disclosure by City National where they disclosed some of the asset sensitivity of their current balance sheet that they had at the end, I believe, of -- at least it was Q2. And they disclosed that in a rate environment that goes up 200 basis points, as you bleed those higher rates into that portfolio, by the end of the second year, they disclosed an asset sensitivity of U.S. $279 million. So very significant sensitivity. I think that's beyond what we disclosed in January. So again, reflecting both the accelerated growth of the balance sheet and the client success they're having, and the short duration of their asset profile leads to very significant asset sensitivity in the context of their overall current earnings structure. So a very exciting part of the synergies and the trajectory of this business, USD 279 million.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gabriel Dechaine (Analysts)】\nWhat about -- how would that compare to the existing Royal business. I know -- is it similar? Is it more? Just trying to get a sense of the full picture, not just City National?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David McKay (Executives)】\nRight. Great question. So we do have a significant amount of suite deposits on our U.S. Wealth Management franchise, that would, as we unlock the value of those, and again, we require the City National acquisition to really get after the use of those deposits and unlock the true value of those suites over time. But certainly that deposit base would have an asset sensitivity. I don't think we've disclosed that and calculated that. Again, it's a meaningful part of the overall earnings potential of our existing U.S. Wealth franchise. So when you combine the 2 businesses together, they both bring fairly material asset sensitivity and interest rate increase earnings potential to ROI.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gabriel Dechaine (Analysts)】\nI think it would be helpful if once it's settled down into integration a little bit, you can give us a bit of a picture there and some rules of thumb for 25 or 100 basis point shift. That keep it simple stupid stuff, we like that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Doug Young (Analysts)】\nJust on the Wealth Management business, and I think, Janice, you mentioned a few points, just I think you mentioned, there is a $21 million, correct me if I'm wrong, restructuring charge coming in Q1. Just wondering, because I thought that was going to be done at the tail end of this year, just wondering what's dragging in to next year? And are we done? And then more broadly on Wealth Management, if I exclude the restructuring charge, I think and correct me if I'm wrong, earnings increase 3% year-over-year, but obviously, your assets were up quite nicely, and I think you've had less transactional activity and [indiscernible] activity or something as such. If you can just enlighten me and maybe kind of guide me in terms of how to think about modeling out or thinking about earnings growth? And then maybe in the same context, what does City National add to that potential in the wealth business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Janice Fukakusa (Executives)】\nOkay, great question, Doug. So what I said about the remainder of the restructuring, it would be about $20 million to $25 million of additional expense after-tax that we'd be taking in Q1. And it is in relation to the fact that we're going as fast as we can, but it's a big and complex project. So there was some overhang into the next fiscal year. If you look at our core Wealth Management earnings and to some degree adjust out a lot of the noise that's happening, we do believe that despite the fact that markets did turn down towards the end of the year, that there was earnings growth on -- in our core businesses in Wealth Management. And we think that as we go through the next year, you'll see more of that core earnings growth because of less of a preoccupation on what we've been doing around International Wealth Management.\n\n---\n\n【回答: A. McGregor (Executives)】\nSo it's Doug, I can add to Janice's comments as well. I think what's been previously disclosed in relation to that restructuring program is that we were largely complete, and so this is moving along that spectrum and is consistent with our expectations for the overall execution of the program. If you'd look back to when we started, our estimate of the cost and timing has been very accurate, it's been quite -- quite well-executed. So you shouldn't view the $20 million to $25 million as additional to what was anticipated before, but rather as Janice said, sort of completion of the last set of activities that are currently contemplated. Part of my job is to come in and take a fresh look at things. So I'll be doing that. But you -- the whole business, but you should regard that program as having been well executed and the last bit is pretty much the completion of what we had talked about before.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David McKay (Executives)】\nAnd Doug, with respect to your question, how does City National fit into overall Wealth Management? We decided to organize around one client, which is the high net worth, ultra-high net worth client in the U.S., putting together our existing U.S. wealth franchise with the City National franchise who serves a very similar customer on the wealth side. In addition, City National serves a very strong commercial customer and links those 2 together, and that organizing philosophy around 1 bank, 1 client is consistent with how we think about our franchise globally, particularly in Canada. So given the client they serve, it belongs in the wealth franchise and we'll roll up overall to our Global Wealth business because of the customer franchise that it serves. So that's where it belongs for now, and that's how it's going to be managed. Russell will report in to myself directly, but the results will show up in the consolidated Global Wealth segment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Doug Young (Analysts)】\nAnd when I think about looking forward, should we expect the margins that have to -- and I believe it's the case, but is there potential for margin improvement in wealth as you integrate the City National, is that the way to think about it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David McKay (Executives)】\nCertainly with respect to our U.S. wealth business, as we look to expand our client wallet and increase the revenue, for sure, and then we look at cost efficiencies from a functional side across the 2 businesses, they're both primary opportunities. But this is, first and foremost, a revenue growth strategy and a cross-sell in deeper client relationships with a larger product shelf. Secondary, it's leveraging the suite and cash deposits that are in the wealth franchise tertiary, it's a cost opportunity across the infrastructure side. So yes, in that order.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sohrab Movahedi (Analysts)】\nMaybe Dave or Janice. When you look at the financial targets that you have, and as we think ahead, what's the basis for example for the EPS growth target, is it the $10 billion? Or is it an adjusted number that's lower? Or how should I think about the atypical movements in the business mix this quarter of Capital Markets and the corporate segment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Janice Fukakusa (Executives)】\nRight. I think -- good question, Sohrab. I think that when you look at our target for EPS growth, it's obviously going to be impacted by the share issuance we did on acquisition of City National. The basis for -- so I would -- we also look at sort of the EPS growth target as a proxy for earnings growth target going forward in the medium term, and so it would be growth based on where we sit today and what is achievable in the medium term. So that would be the basis given our current trajectories and how we look at the medium term in terms of our outlook, our business mix, taking into consideration the things Dave talked about, about the growth potential we have with, for example, City National and our solid performance in all of our underlying segments, we believe we can achieve the medium-term objectives as set out in our annual report. But there will be some pressure on EPS, definitely, in the short run because of the issuance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sohrab Movahedi (Analysts)】\nGreat. I mean, just to be clear, Janice, and I'm not suggesting this is an annual target, but if we were going to start the measurement period today and look ahead, the starting point is the $9.9 billion adjusted net income?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Janice Fukakusa (Executives)】\nYes. That's where -- how we're looking at it. And these are absolutely not annual financial targets. They are about the medium term. As you know, there is movement without, and that's why we look at a medium-term objective and not setting annual guidance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sohrab Movahedi (Analysts)】\nPerfect, and that's very helpful. Now maybe this one is, again, for Dave or Janice. When you think about this medium-term target, if you think over the next, I don't know, couple of years, where do you think the primary driver of the leverage is going to come from, is it going to be on the revenue line? Or is it going to be on the expense line?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David McKay (Executives)】\nI would say it'd have to come from both. It's a good question, and we're certainly excited about the growth opportunities of our Capital Markets opportunity -- Capital Markets franchise and our wealth franchise with City National in the U.S. and capitalizing on a strong U.S. market so that presents very strong revenue growth opportunity. We have a very balanced and strong Canadian franchise, whether the growth is in on the wealth side, commercial side, Capital Markets or consumer, we are poised from a business perspective, from a geographic perspective, to capture that growth in Canada, we've demonstrated that over a decade now, so -- and we feel strongly about that. So when you look at our ability to grow where we see the pockets of growth globally, we feel very strongly, particularly with our North American franchise and in an emerging business that Doug is building with ITS and Capital Markets in Europe, albeit that could be a more prolonged play of economic recovery, but we're certainly investing for that long-term play. So that really is where we look at the revenue side. There is an enormous opportunity digitally to look at efficiencies to streamline customer processes to redeploy our employees into higher value-added activities. So that's an ongoing, longer term secular opportunity to become more efficient. And the last thing I would add is, you look at the delta on earnings from an interest rate increase, on our Canadian balance sheet, it's significant, with the largest, as I talked about in my speech, core deposit franchise on the consumer and business side that is seeing historically low compression in margins. As that accelerates in an eventual rising rate environment, that also gives us confidence in our long-term trajectory to meet those earnings objectives. So I think you look at diversification, you look at our growth strategy in the U.S., you look at our ability to use technology, and you look at our balance sheet and our core deposit franchise, they are all reasons to be positive about these medium-term objectives.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meny Grauman (Analysts)】\nDuring the prepared remarks, you noted signs of stress in Alberta, and I'm not sure if I missed it, but I was wondering if you could kind of clarify what you're referring to, what you're seeing in the province?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hughes (Executives)】\nYes, certainly, it's Mark here. I guess, I'd point to 2 things. One, as I've said throughout the year, one of the early warning signals we monitor is unemployment and unemployment has moved up. So that is obviously an economic impact for the -- for all of us in the province. And then the second point I mentioned is we did see some slight uptick in delinquencies in our card portfolio. I would say that that's quite slight, it is less than 1% of our outstandings in our Alberta card portfolio, but because we are watching so closely, we did notice it, so we will now continue to monitor that going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meny Grauman (Analysts)】\nAnd I'm wondering going to the expense side, a lot of discussion there, definitely technology spending is in focus for Canadian banks and globally, and I'm wondering from your perspective, do you have any sense that -- does Royal Bank have an advantage when it comes to technology spending in the current environment? I mean, we tend to think of scale as being important to your -- do you believe that that is still an important factor in terms of being able to handle these expenses better relative to peers? Are there any other factors that would suggest that Royal has an advantage when it comes to meeting these significant challenges when it comes to technology spending?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hughes (Executives)】\nI would say there're 2 things that favor us. One, we started this journey probably earlier than many of our peers, almost 7 or 8 years ago, and have been on a legacy system replacement technology build over a prolonged period of time, whether it's the retail credit transformation project, commercial projects, and we started this a while ago. So we sequence this over a period of time and got some of the big projects out of the way and are allowed to -- are enabled to focus more on the digital projects now. So I think -- I've talked about that many times over the last 5 years, and we feel that we've gotten a lot of heavy lifting done, but we've got a significant amount of work to do where others may be playing catch-up on both those fronts. Second thing is scale. I mean technology cost for all of us is probably less for us with our purchasing power, but let's say it's even the same when the size of our income statement and our revenue line allows us to spend more than our competitors, and it's going to cost us the same to deliver many of these apps in the digital world or back-office technology integrations or digital processes. So I'd say, timing and scale are advantages.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Routledge (Analysts)】\nProbably a question for Janice. There's always a lot of talk about the level of capital, but I want to ask a question about the cost of capital, particularly nonequity capital. You may have noticed there was a pressure issuance by one of your peers where we saw widening by about 2x on spreads. NVCC subdebt spreads are wider by 90 basis points, next couple of years we'll have bail-in, that's probably going to raise your long-term deposit funding cost by 20 to 40 basis points. I guess you are going to pass this along to customers or shareholders, and I suspect more of it will go to customers. So what are -- do you think that's right? Am I right in that assessment? And secondly, if so what are the implications for Canadian credit quality as loan yields move up?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Janice Fukakusa (Executives)】\nSo that's a good question, Peter, because you would have seen from our perspective that we do a lot of funding in the markets and when we do funding, we try to fund 3 to 6 months ahead of our requirements so that we don't get caught in pricing pressures and have to replace that funding. And when we look at our own funding spread because of where credit markets have been, they've widened out, but with our base we are still funding pretty much below the AA- equivalence of other financial service companies. I think that as we get more clarity around bail-in, we will have more clarity around the debt ratings. I think that that is a bit of an overhang for all of the Canadian issuers in terms of determining what the bail-in triggers are and that sort of stuff, but from our perspective, we are well aware of the potential for funding cost to drift up, and that's why we are totally focused on balance sheet optimization, looking at the correct returns and making sure that we are never caught short in terms of our own funding needs, and that we can satisfy them well in advance of when we have the requirements. So I think that's how we look at the funding equation with all of the uncertainties.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David McKay (Executives)】\nI want to thank everyone for joining us this morning, and also for your support and engagement over the past year as we've had very constructive dialogue and certainly appreciate your questions. And I'd like to take this opportunity at this part of the season to wish you and your families all the very best for a safe and happy holiday season. We'll see you in Q1. Thanks very much.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, and thank you for joining our 2016 Financial Outlook conference call. Please find our presentation for today's call on our website at www.investor.prudential.com. Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by John and Rob, and then we will answer your questions.\r\nToday's presentation includes forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation includes references to a non-GAAP measure. The slide deck includes a reconciliation of such measure to the comparable GAAP measure and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ many from those in the forward-looking statements. \r\nAnd with that, I will hand it over to John.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mark. I'd like to welcome everyone to our 2016 Financial Outlook presentation. Before Rob takes you through the specifics, I wanted to provide some higher-level observations, and I will begin on Slide 2.\r\nThe key message is that while we anticipate some near-term headwinds, we believe the earnings power of our businesses should produce an overall ROE of 13% to 14% across the cycle, and we remain positive on our prospects for 2016 and beyond.\r\nOur ROE target reflects our attractive mix of protection, retirement and asset management businesses, and facilitates our ability to invest appropriately across our platforms and infrastructure to capture longer-term growth opportunities. At the same time, we are generating increasing levels of free cash flow that support a balanced approach to capital deployment. This allows us to pursue outsized organic and inorganic growth opportunities and return capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, while continuing to meet our standards for financial strength.\r\nLast month, we announced a 21% increase in our dividend to an annualized rate of $2.80 per share. And today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion for calendar year 2016. These actions incorporate our expectation that we should produce deployable capital equal to about 60% of our earnings over time. It also reflects the confidence we have in our balance sheet and capital position.\r\nWe are also focusing on reducing the complexity and volatility in our businesses. This morning, we are announcing our intention to recapture our variable annuity living benefit riders from our captive and house all of our VA product risks in our statutory insurance entities in 2016. \r\nWhile we have always managed these risks on an economic basis and held strong reserves and capital against these risks, a practice that we will continue, managing through a captive has added a source of complexity and capital volatility that has distracted from the core fundamentals of our business. Rob will provide a high-level view of the planned recapture later.\r\nThis action follows the implementation earlier this year of our divisional reporting structure in Japan, which has mitigated the noneconomic impact of foreign currency remeasurement on our net income, historically a large source of volatility. These actions should contribute to a simpler story and a more stable capital position going forward. \r\nWe do face near-term headwinds. The impact of low interest rates, weaker foreign currencies, more conservative expectations for noncoupon investment income, along with continued higher levels of initiative-related expenses, all contributed to some pressures on earnings expectations that are factored into our 2016 guidance. And we continue to navigate the evolving regulatory environment. \r\nHaving said that, our track record of innovation and execution, together with the investments we are making in our longer-term opportunities, give us confidence in our ability to succeed over the long run.\r\nTurning to Slide 3. This shows our return on equity since 2010. The key takeaway is that you see the strong growth in our ROE from 2010 to current levels. This reflects key acquisitions that were successfully integrated, including Star and Edison from AIG and Hartford's Life business, our success in building the pension risk transfer business, the positive impact of improvement in equity markets and healthy capital returns to shareholders. It also reflects strong execution across our international and domestic businesses.\r\nMore recent results have also benefited from tailwinds that cannot be expected to recur, such as the benefits from noncoupon investment income above our average expectations, better-than-expected underwriting experience in our domestic and international life businesses, and favorable pension risk transfer case experience. While our ROE has recently exceeded 15%, we believe a 13% to 14% ROE target through the cycle is appropriate, given our business mix and ongoing investments to support longer-term growth opportunities. \r\nI'll now turn it over to Rob and will later follow up with some concluding comments. Rob?\n\n---\n\nThank you, John. Slides 4 and 5 summarize some of the key considerations at a business-unit level that affect how we think about 2016. As many of you are aware, we do not provide guidance at the segment level or specific sales outlooks, as they can be inherently volatile and our overall guidance represents a range of potential outcomes. And while I don't plan to go into detail as to the specific items or to quantify their potential impact beyond the few key sensitivity items that we've included, we thought these observations might be helpful as you think about your own models in the context of our overall guidance.\r\nI won't go through all the points, but here are some highlights. In International Insurance, we expect continued growth of our Life Planner count, including targeted low single digit growth in Japan with a commensurate impact on sales and a slightly greater impact on in-force business, given our high persistency. \r\nAt Gibraltar, we stabilized the Life Consultant count and see expanding distribution as an opportunity for modest growth. While the weaker yen is a near-term earnings headwind, the contribution of U.S. dollar and other non-yen business and our hedging programs are significant mitigants.\r\nIn Individual Life, we expect to continue our strategy of a diversified product mix, targeting new business comprised of roughly 1/3 guaranteed universal life, 1/3 term and 1/3 other products. Retention of a greater share of mortality risk will also contribute to our revenue growth prospects.\r\nIn Group Insurance, with substantially all of the disability repricing now behind us and improvements in underwriting and claims management in place, we feel that we are now positioned for controlled growth, exercising pricing discipline as we seek new business opportunities. \r\nIn Retirement, we expect opportunities in pension risk transfer to continue to drive account value growth, but are not assuming jumbo case wins for 2016 because of their episodic nature.\r\nIn Asset Management, we expect earnings to be driven by the growth of core asset management fees, the fee yields on AUM consistent with 2015. We will continue to invest in the business as we launch new funds, build our asset-class capabilities and expand distribution. \r\nAnd in Annuities, we will continue to execute on our product diversification strategy. While there are still uncertainties on the impact of the DOL proposals, we feel that we are well positioned to adapt.\r\nIn addition, one of our key initiatives for 2016, as mentioned by John and which is further outlined on Slide 6, is the recapture of our variable annuity living benefit rider from our captive reinsurer. We plan to manage the risks of this rider, along with the risks of the base contract, including the death benefits, together in our statutory entities. \r\nWe've obtained approvals from the insurance regulators for the key aspects of our recapture plan, which will be implemented in phases during 2016. We'll provide more detail when we complete the recapture, but here are some of the key takeaways. Going forward, we will continue to manage these risks at CTE 97 capital and reserve levels. This reflects our view of prudent management of the economic risk and we believe is consistent with our AA ratings objectives.\r\nUpon completion, we expect to fully manage product-related capital markets risks within the Annuities business. Importantly, given our current management of living benefit risks, we expect to fully cover the net impact of the recapture with existing capital and reserves.\r\nUpon completion, we expect the recapture transaction to substantially reduce the volatility in capital and capital debt that we have historically experienced due to our variable annuity business. With this reduced volatility and the simplified corporate structure, we anticipate our available on-balance sheet capital capacity will show more stability on a quarterly basis and become less relevant than other indicators of our financial strength and flexibility, including our regulatory solvency ratios, our leverage ratios, cash flow distributions to the holding company and cash resources at the holding company.\r\nWhile we are initiating this recapture in advance of definitive guidance coming out of the NAIC's variable annuity issues initiative, we have been supportive of and highly engaged in this initiative with the NAIC and their consultant, Oliver Wyman, as well as with others in the industry. We are encouraged by the direction of this initiative. The terms of our recapture have been approved by our regulators and are consistent with the issues identified by Oliver Wyman and the NAIC.\r\nTurning to Slide 7. Here are some of the key assumptions and considerations that underpin our guidance. Our guidance assumes a 2015 ending S&P 500 level of 2,080, growing at 6% over the year and ending 2016 at 2,205. \r\nOur International Insurance non-U.S. dollar earnings are fully hedged for 2016 at JPY 106 and KRW 1,100 per dollar. \r\nOur interest rates assumptions are based on an averaging of observed forward yield curves. As a benchmark, we assume the 10-year treasury rate increases to 2.5% by the end of 2016.\r\nWe expect returns on noncoupon investments, which have been above average expectations for the past several years, to produce about a $0.05 shortfall to our average long-term expectations. \r\nWe expect our continuing investment in technology, infrastructure and digital initiatives, together with enhanced supervision costs, to result in incremental costs of about $0.15 per share relevant to 2015. \r\nWe are assuming a modest initial contribution to results from the closing of our AFP Habitat acquisition in Chile. We are expecting an effective tax rate of approximately 25%, modestly below our 2015 expectation, reflecting business mix and the full year impact of lower tax rates in Japan.\r\nWe expect to maintain our balanced approach to capital deployment. Our board has approved an increase in our share repurchase program with a $1.5 billion authorization for calendar year 2016, as mentioned by John. This reflects our expectation that about 60% of our after-tax adjusted operating income will become available for deployment over time and complements the 21% increase in our quarterly dividend that we announced in November.\r\nAnd we expect our leverage ratios to be within our targets. \r\nTurning to Slide 8.  To level set, this slide starts with our reported results and removes the impact of market-driven and discrete items, and then nets favorable variances from our average expectations that we've called out during the course of the year, primarily including mortality and pension risk transfer case experience and returns on noncoupon investments.  This takes you to a baseline of about $7.35 per share for the first 9 months in 2015. \r\nWe then add a hypothetical fourth quarter that is based on our third quarter run rate, but adjusted for the historically higher level of expenses that we typically experience in the fourth quarter. We pointed to a historical average of about $150 million to $200 million of increased costs or roughly $0.20 to $0.30 per share in our last earnings call. This leads to a pro forma baseline range of $9.50 to $9.60 per share. While this should not be viewed as a projection of our full year 2015 results, we believe it provides a useful baseline for discussing our 2016 guidance.\r\nTurning to Slide 9. Starting from our 2015 pro forma baseline range, if you take into account the change in foreign exchange rates, including the plan rate for the yen from JPY 91 to JPY 106, which reduces the base line to a range of $9.25 to $9.35 per share, market factors are expected to have a mixed impact on 2016 earnings.  We are assuming that the continued low interest rate environment will have a negative impact in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per share, mainly driven by reinvestment rates and investment yields on incoming premiums at lower available rates, net of the benefits of liabilities repricing. However, this is partially offset by other market factors, including our assumed 6% depreciation in the equity markets.\r\nWe expect solid continued core grow growth in our businesses, with key considerations and sensitivities as I reviewed earlier. And we expect to balance our use of capital between deployment in our businesses based on market opportunities; investments, including the AFP Habitat acquisition; and return to our shareholders, including our increased share buyback authorization. Putting all this together, our 2016 earnings guidance range for baseline adjusted operating income is $9.75 to $10.25 per share.\r\nOn Slide 10, you can see the estimated impact of our earnings per share from a plus or minus 10% movement in the equity markets and a plus or minus 100 basis point change in interest rates, assumed in each case to occur at the beginning of 2016 and viewed in isolation.\r\nAs shown, a 10% move in the equity markets translates to about $0.30 per share in our results, while a 100 basis point change in interest rates, defined as a parallel shift to the yield curve, is worth about $0.20 per share for 2016. \r\nI would like to caution that these sensitivities are not necessarily linear and are not entirely symmetrical, and should not be extrapolated over more severe shock levels in either direction. Still, they should provide a useful framework to help understand the direction and order of magnitude of 2 of the more important macro assumptions that affect our results, overlaying the business-level sensitivities that we showed earlier.\r\nNow I'll turn it back to John.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Rob. As you've heard, we remain positive on our positioning as a company and on our long-term prospects. Yes, we have some near-term headwinds, but we believe our unique business model, which has benefited from superior innovation and execution over many years, should continue to generate top-tier returns with growth and strong excess capital generation.  Further, we are taking steps to simplify our business model and reduce sources of volatility, which has sometimes obscured our strong fundamental performance. \r\nWith that, I'll turn it over to the operator to start the question-and-answer session.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Mark Finkelstein (Executives)】\nThank you, Cynthia. Good morning, and thank you for joining our 2016 Financial Outlook conference call. Please find our presentation for today's call on our website at www.investor.prudential.com. Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by John and Rob, and then we will answer your questions.\r\nToday's presentation includes forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation includes references to a non-GAAP measure. The slide deck includes a reconciliation of such measure to the comparable GAAP measure and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ many from those in the forward-looking statements. \r\nAnd with that, I will hand it over to John.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: John Strangfeld (Executives)】\nThank you, Mark. I'd like to welcome everyone to our 2016 Financial Outlook presentation. Before Rob takes you through the specifics, I wanted to provide some higher-level observations, and I will begin on Slide 2.\r\nThe key message is that while we anticipate some near-term headwinds, we believe the earnings power of our businesses should produce an overall ROE of 13% to 14% across the cycle, and we remain positive on our prospects for 2016 and beyond.\r\nOur ROE target reflects our attractive mix of protection, retirement and asset management businesses, and facilitates our ability to invest appropriately across our platforms and infrastructure to capture longer-term growth opportunities. At the same time, we are generating increasing levels of free cash flow that support a balanced approach to capital deployment. This allows us to pursue outsized organic and inorganic growth opportunities and return capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, while continuing to meet our standards for financial strength.\r\nLast month, we announced a 21% increase in our dividend to an annualized rate of $2.80 per share. And today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion for calendar year 2016. These actions incorporate our expectation that we should produce deployable capital equal to about 60% of our earnings over time. It also reflects the confidence we have in our balance sheet and capital position.\r\nWe are also focusing on reducing the complexity and volatility in our businesses. This morning, we are announcing our intention to recapture our variable annuity living benefit riders from our captive and house all of our VA product risks in our statutory insurance entities in 2016. \r\nWhile we have always managed these risks on an economic basis and held strong reserves and capital against these risks, a practice that we will continue, managing through a captive has added a source of complexity and capital volatility that has distracted from the core fundamentals of our business. Rob will provide a high-level view of the planned recapture later.\r\nThis action follows the implementation earlier this year of our divisional reporting structure in Japan, which has mitigated the noneconomic impact of foreign currency remeasurement on our net income, historically a large source of volatility. These actions should contribute to a simpler story and a more stable capital position going forward. \r\nWe do face near-term headwinds. The impact of low interest rates, weaker foreign currencies, more conservative expectations for noncoupon investment income, along with continued higher levels of initiative-related expenses, all contributed to some pressures on earnings expectations that are factored into our 2016 guidance. And we continue to navigate the evolving regulatory environment. \r\nHaving said that, our track record of innovation and execution, together with the investments we are making in our longer-term opportunities, give us confidence in our ability to succeed over the long run.\r\nTurning to Slide 3. This shows our return on equity since 2010. The key takeaway is that you see the strong growth in our ROE from 2010 to current levels. This reflects key acquisitions that were successfully integrated, including Star and Edison from AIG and Hartford's Life business, our success in building the pension risk transfer business, the positive impact of improvement in equity markets and healthy capital returns to shareholders. It also reflects strong execution across our international and domestic businesses.\r\nMore recent results have also benefited from tailwinds that cannot be expected to recur, such as the benefits from noncoupon investment income above our average expectations, better-than-expected underwriting experience in our domestic and international life businesses, and favorable pension risk transfer case experience. While our ROE has recently exceeded 15%, we believe a 13% to 14% ROE target through the cycle is appropriate, given our business mix and ongoing investments to support longer-term growth opportunities. \r\nI'll now turn it over to Rob and will later follow up with some concluding comments.

As you've heard, we remain positive on our positioning as a company and on our long-term prospects. Yes, we have some near-term headwinds, but we believe our unique business model, which has benefited from superior innovation and execution over many years, should continue to generate top-tier returns with growth and strong excess capital generation.  Further, we are taking steps to simplify our business model and reduce sources of volatility, which has sometimes obscured our strong fundamental performance. \r\nWith that, I'll turn it over to the operator to start the question-and-answer session.",
      "transcript_text3": "Rob, first question on the annuity recapture for you is, I assume this won't change your view of excess capital because you're indicating CTE 97 is still the level you're going to capitalize the business at. But can you talk a little bit about what this would do to more of the cosmetics in terms of RBC? I assume the reserves will go down and equity will go up, if you're going to be using statutory instead of GAAP from a capitalization standpoint. Can you talk a bit about how the mechanics are going to work here?\n\n---\n\nTom, let me take that in 2 pieces, put the mechanics aside from the RBC and the capital implications. So as you said and as we've shared in the past, we've got total assets in our captives that are about twice the reserves that we're getting released from at the seeding company when we hold capital to CTE 97. And we do intend to continue to manage capital reserves associated with the living benefit rider economically going forward, consistent with that historical practice and consistent with our view of what's appropriate for our objectives of being AA rated. At this point in time, given the number of moving pieces and the complexity of that undertaking, Tom, we're not going to provide any further insight into how that may actually manifest itself in the statutory results. There is -- there are a number of intersecting pieces on that, that would make it a difficult question to answer at this point in time. Having said that, we're very comfortable that both from a statutory standpoint and an economic standpoint, that we have sufficient resources and that this will not have a negative outcome affecting either of those.\n\n---\n\nBut just a follow-up on that, Rob. So is the right way to view this that it's likely to have a neutral to positive impact on overall enterprise-wide capital from an excess capital view standpoint? Or is it really just more neutral, because there's not really much of a change happening there?\n\n---\n\nWell, Tom, I go back to what I said. I think what we're comfortable saying at this point in time is that we're very comfortable that we can fully cover the net impact of the recapture with the existing capital and reserves that we have.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and then my follow-up is simply on the noncoupon investment returns. You're using 6% to 7% long term, and I assume, by modestly low or slightly lower near term, is 5% the number that you're assuming on that? And then the related question is, what is it about your noncoupon investments that you are assuming 6% to 7%? I think most of your peers on similar assets are using 8% to 10%. Is that you guys have more -- have less private equity in your noncoupon investments? Or is that something you could shed some light on?\n\n---\n\nSo taking those in turn, Tom, I think what I indicated in my remarks upfront, we think it's going to be about a $0.05 in terms of the relative under-performance vis-à-vis the 6% targeted returns. So that's -- it's relatively modest, but we wanted to call that out. In terms of the composition of the portfolio and the basis for the 6% to 7%, I can't compare our alternative portfolio to our peers, but I can provide you a little bit of transparency what's in ours. The PE component of our alternatives is a little under 1/3 and hedge funds make up between -- up to about 15%. Real estate is about 20% of it. And then what we also include in there is our public equity portfolio. That exists primarily in our international operations vis-à-vis our domestic, and that accounts for about 1/3 of that overall alternative allocation. Blending that in, based on our view of what are sustainable levels of returns from those different classes of alternative securities, we think 6% to 7% is an appropriate level.\n\n---\n\nJust one question on your PRT assumption. I know you've mentioned you're not assuming any jumbo transactions, but are you assuming some level of activity in 2015? Or would any transactions that you do be accretive to your assumptions?\n\n---\n\nErik, this is Steve. No, we're assuming continued momentum in the business. As we've discussed before, the pipeline looks strong. The marketplace interest in the value proposition of pension risk transfer is strong and, I would say, growing. So we do expect the continued momentum and success in the business. What we wanted to emphasize was that if you're talking about jumbo transactions, we should probably use some more clarity around jumbo. If you're going to talk about the very large transactions of, say, $4 billion to $5 billion and above, I'm talking on the funded side here, we do not -- we did not incorporate anything like that into our guidance. But if you're talking about some of the transactions that have -- aside from the very large ones that we've done, if you're talking about some of the transactions that in recent periods, for example, have been the range in which we play at frequently in the market, say in $1 billion range, those we absolutely anticipate further success in that regard.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just on the investment spending, can you just comment a little bit more on where you're making some of the investments? And will that run through the business segments? Or is part of that going through corporate?\n\n---\n\nThis is Rob. So it's at both levels. So there is some level of corporate spending that's baked into those numbers, but there is not an insignificant amount that's down at the business unit level as well. And that investment spending, I think in the total number that we gave you in terms of the increase there, it also includes our regulatory spend. So -- and I would think about that as being -- roughly thinking about it as being half and half between what would be at the -- the increase that what would be at the house versus what you would find down at the business unit level.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then the business unit investments, it's primarily investment management, and where else would we see that?\n\n---\n\nYou'd see it in part in the investment management business, Erik, as you mentioned, but you'd also see it in terms of the investments we're making in our digital platform and data analytics across our businesses, and systems investments in some of the other domestic businesses. And Charlie will speak to the international dimension.\n\n---\n\nYes, and then that's relatively true on the international side too. We have some end-of-life issues, but we also are making investments in systems to create better efficiencies and do things for customers to make it easier for them. So it's consistent amongst the businesses.\n\n---\n\nOn the technology and infrastructure spending, how should we think about those -- that level of expenses beyond 2016? It seems like technology and infrastructure-type spending should continue at a similar rate beyond 2016, but is that correct or not?\n\n---\n\nJimmy, it's Rob. And yes, we -- our expectation is this is, as we spoke about it last year, it is a multi-year phenomena, so we should expect this elevated level of spending for the next couple of years in any event. And so in the foreseeable horizon, we'll continue to make these levels of investments. It will eventually drop back down, but not in the immediate future.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then on -- you didn't quantify the earnings impact from Habitat. But are you expecting any initial investments or integration spending or investments into the business that will dampen the earnings in the first few quarters that you have the business?\n\n---\n\nNo, we don't think so. This is an investment in a joint venture. We're extremely comfortable with Habitat. We very much like the company and the management, and therefore don't anticipate significant expenditures, once we make the acquisition of the joint venture interest.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just lastly, on share repurchases, you've been fairly stable in how you've based the buybacks over time. Should we assume that'll continue even though your buyback number is going up a little bit from 2015 into '16?\n\n---\n\nWe haven't changed our philosophy with regard to how we think about share buybacks. We've just changed the quantum, Jimmy.\n\n---\n\nRob, I was hoping first that you could just update us on the yen macro hedge, maybe the size of that gain now and how it's going to get paid out over time?\n\n---\n\nSure. Well, what I would do in that respect is actually repeat or cover where we were as of the end of the third quarter because I can't really update you beyond that. So in terms of actually realized gains from the macro hedge, on an after-tax basis through the first 9 months of the year, we had about $400 million worth of harvested gains there. At the end of the third quarter, the mark-to-market on the yen hedge was at -- or roughly around $2.12 billion [ph]. A significant portion of that amortizes between the third quarter of this year and the end of 2017, about 3/4 of it actually will amortize over that period of time, or will be harvested over that period of time. As that occurs, that would then go into our capital capacity.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then on the VA recapture, just a quick 2 there. Again, I want to try to follow up on what Tom was asking, and I think the effect on your views of excess capital following this. I think -- I guess, a yes or no. I think Tom's question really was, if you look at this on an economic basis, and presumably the 400 RBC capital spend that you had set up as a base was viewed as an economic standard, I mean, does this really have an effect on the excess capital from an economic standpoint, in your view?\n\n---\n\nAgain, I'll repeat what I said before, Steven, is that when we bring this together, we think this is a more effective way to manage the risks that we have associated with the VA business, both the host contract and the rider. The -- and they're both -- there are operational efficiencies associated with doing it that way. And there is, as John indicated, it's a -- it reduces complexity and gives us greater flexibility for how we think about moving capital around the enterprise. The volatility that you've seen related to our annuities business in the back -- in the past has in part been driven by the fact that we don't have complete fungibility, and in any given quarter, our ability to move gains in one part of the organization to areas where they would be offset with losses in other starts -- in other parts of the organization. So we get that increased flexibility. Beyond that, I think when I go back to the statement, which is, when we look at the level of reserving that we do and the way in which we hold capital for this business, we think about then moving that over into the new construct, we're very comfortable that we have the appropriate levels of economic reserves and capital to manage this in the same way on a go-forward basis.\n\n---\n\nRob, just last one. Does the new structure -- does that mitigate kind of the capital swings associated with the shortage of straight position in the hedging?\n\n---\n\nSo yes, that is in fact the point. So as we've looked at the way we've managed the rider within that captive, to the extent that there are -- in any given quarter, that we would have seen volatility in capital because we had losses within the captive, we would have gains in other parts of the organization. We were not necessarily able to offset those because we couldn't get the capital out of the areas in which we had gains and over into the areas, where -- in this case the captive, where we had the shortfall. By eliminating the captive and consolidating it back in with the host, we'll substantially mitigate that dynamic that you've seen in the past.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to go back to the guidance, Slide 9. So the $9.75 to $10.25 range, you offer basically 3 buckets driving that: the market factors, core growth and capital deployment. Which of these buckets would really lead to you coming at the lower end versus of the higher end of that range?\n\n---\n\nSo I think about it this way. If you look at each of those 3 buckets, start with the market bucket. I think we've given you the assumptions that are in there. So from a market standpoint, rates we indicated are having a negative impact of $0.15 to $0.20. And we've given some sensitivity metrics so that you can calibrate what would happen to that based on movements in the -- we've given you off the 10-year. We've, I think, given you some -- we've giving you the indication of our alternative performance against our expectations. There is a correlation of that performance with equity markets that drives a not insignificant component of that. And then we've given you our equity market assumption, which is about a 6% growth. So -- and we've given you sensitivities around that number as well. So to the extent that we're more than -- less than the 6%, you continue to do the calibrations there. So I think you've got a good sense for how the market component of this could contribute or detract from our growth, depending on how events actually play out against the assumptions that we have built in the forecast. With regard to the -- I'll go to the far right-hand side. The core growth is driven by all the things that we walked through upfront. Obviously, we can outperform our baseline expectations, but a lot of that is actually driven in large part by an installed book of business as opposed to incremental sales. And so while we think there is -- there could be variability around sales and upsides, it won't have as material an impact as what's driven from the embedded book, which brings you to the middle piece, which is capital deployment. And what we have there is we've given you some transparency, I think, at how some of that capital will be deployed: the Chilean acquisition, the increased level of buybacks. But where we are in the range will be influenced by how that capital is actually deployed during the -- excess capital is actually deployed during the year and the rate at which it's deployed.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And this last part, actually, is a good segue to my second question. When we look at capital deployment opportunities or your appetite to deploy capital, are you also considering, let's say, blocks similar to what you did with Hartford a few years ago? I think there may be a few blocks out on the market now. Or is it mostly pension risk transfers and the Habitat?\n\n---\n\nThis is John. If you look back, we've --  you've seen a mix of those types of activities, and a series of these have had step-function impacts, whether it's large-scale PRT transactions or whether it's activities we have done with AIG, the Star and Edison, or whether it's Hartford, we're certainly open to those sorts of things. As we thought about our business, our sentiment around this is, there -- we like to do, not have to do. Meaning, we're feeling very focused on core businesses and the core growth prospects, and innovation, and execution, but we've shown a pattern over time, more in certain phases of the cycle than in others, of being opportunistic in a variety of different ways. And as Steve pointed out, it's hard -- in the PRT business, where large-scale activities are lumpy and unpredictable, it's just difficult and probably unwise to be layering them into financial planning. But certainly, we have an interest for that, and we certainly have the capacity for it as well.\n\n---\n\nMy first question is just about the increase in the buyback authorization. I know money is fungible, but I'm curious. What's really specifically driving that? Is that just more confidence in the 60% free cash flow? Or is there some element there that we should be considering related to the monetization of the yen equity hedge? I ask this specifically because I think, over time -- excuse my voice, the equity hedge is intended to provide an offset to the translation impact of a weaker yen on your operating income. But if we look at Slide 9, you're clearly showing us a 2.5% to 3% headwind from currency. So I'm just wondering how to think about the increase in the buyback authorization.\n\n---\n\nJohn, it's Rob. So let me try to address that for you. I would think about the buybacks, first and foremost, being consistent with the 21% increase in the dividend. And both the dividend and the buybacks reflect a couple of things. One, it's confidence in the strength of our balance sheet. It is driven by the increased level of earnings translating into free cash flow. We previously gave guidance that, that number was around 50%, and we increased that most recently to the 60% number. That's about a 20% increase, sort of not inconsistent with the level of increase that we did in our dividend. But it also is, in part, the harvesting of the yen equity hedge gains. As I mentioned, when Tom or whoever asked the earlier question, we've realized about $400 million after tax of that in the first 9 months of the year. We still got another $2 billion out there. And interestingly, I think when I provided how much of that was actually maturing, it's about 50% of that, that I think matures through the end of 2017. But we understand and have communicated to you that, that yen equity hedge us is designed and calibrated so, over time, the gains from the hedge can be redeployed to offset any dilution in earnings resulting from a depreciation in the yen. That doesn't happen immediately. There is a lag. As we're harvesting and realizing, it has to be redeployed, and the actual harvesting doesn't line up entirely with the dilution associated with the earnings. But if you look over a multiyear period of time, what you will find is that the redeployment of capital, either in the form of acquisitions or buybacks, will be well correlated to the dilution that we're seeing in earnings per share from the yen. And so you should expect those things over time to offset.\n\n---\n\nSo then if I could summarize it this way, Rob, would this be a reasonable expectation? We can think about capital return or deployment, dividends plus buybacks, around 60%, and then plus or minus whatever the change in the yen hedge may be?\n\n---\n\nWell, we look at buybacks as being a variable, not a set-in-stone number. It is -- when we look at capital redeployment, we look at the variety of ways in which we may go about doing that. So to the extent that there are opportunities either within the business, super organic growth opportunities like we've talked about with PRT, or there should be exogenous things like acquisitions, we would -- we might alter the level of buybacks that we're doing in order to finance those. And similarly, to the extent that we're anticipating that those sort of the things we're holding capital in order to have the flexibility to pursue them but they don't manifest, we might alter it in the other way. So I would say, we don't want to become overly programmatic about the direction we would give on that, but I think what you should think about is we generate a lot of capital, 60% of earnings every year, and that we're good stewards of that capital don't tend to hoard it, but rather redeploy it to the benefit of shareholders.\n\n---\n\nAnd then the last real quick one is just on Habitat. Since you announced the deal -- and boy, it's been some time now, the Chilean peso has weakened considerably versus the U.S. dollar. I'm just wondering how we should think about the cash outlay, assuming this thing is going to close in the next couple of months. If the Chilean peso didn't move from here versus the dollar, do we think about a cash outlay here that's going to be substantially less than what you had originally announced?\n\n---\n\nI think we give you a range before of about $530 million to $620 million, and we feel comfortable with that range. We have not hedged the acquisition. So obviously, there will be a benefit in terms of U.S. dollars. But it'll be -- that's the range we gave. We feel comfortable with that.\n\n---\n\nMy first question is on Slide 8, talking about the 2015 adjusted baseline results. Could you give us some more insight on what that $0.20 to $0.30 EPS headwind would be from seasonally increased expenses?\n\n---\n\nSo you're talking about bridge to the full year basis. That's the -- I think the number we gave was -- yes, the $0.20 to $0.30 adjustment from our third quarter run rate. Is that what you're referring to, Jay?\n\n---\n\nCorrect.\n\n---\n\nYes. So I'll actually turn that over to both Charlie and to Steve to talk about sort of the seasonality that exists with the International and the U.S. businesses. Specifically at a corporate level, we tend to have a higher level of expenses at corporate in the fourth quarter. It reflects things like some of the spending that we do and accruals that we make that are catch-up's, tend to get caught up in the fourth quarter and therefore not evenly distributed during the course of the year, but it's also driven by level of expenditures that we have down at the businesses. So Charlie and Steve?\n\n---\n\nSure, I'll go first. It's Charlie. In terms of the International business, you do you have seasonal expenses that sort of come in the fourth quarter. One of the obvious ones is mailings. So you have a mailing that happens in the fourth quarter every year, especially in Japan. We have a lot of customers, and actually, that's a fair amount of money. You also have some technology and systems cost that tend to be back-ended and spent in the fourth quarter. So it's a variety of different things. It's nothing in particular, but it is consistent and it is -- it does happen.\n\n---\n\nAnd Jay, the answer on the domestic side would be very similar. I'd say principal driver of fourth quarter seasonality of expenses is mailings. That's when we're sending out a lot of contractual materials, a lot of disclosure-type materials, and that's reflected in our fourth quarter historical seasonally high expense level.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So Rob, I might be overly simplistic about this. But if I look at your 2015 baseline of between $9.50, $9.60 versus the third quarter year-to-date 2015 baseline result of $7.35, the difference at the midpoint is around $2.20. Is that the right way we should think about the outlook for 4Q?\n\n---\n\nYes, I cannot comment on outlook for 4Q. We did not provide this analytic as a way to give you a view toward where 2015 would turn out, but rather to establish a basis upon which we could talk about 2016, without giving any forward-looking guidance on our results for the fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I mean, the Street's just above that. And then the second, I guess, broader issue is, I'm just seeing some reports come out that there is likely -- that the Democrats are likely to block the fiduciary rule from being part of the omnibus spending bill. And given kind of that breaking perspective, I think it'd be helpful to get Prudential's view on where we're headed with the fiduciary standards proposal.\n\n---\n\nJay, this is Steve. I wouldn't venture to comment on the different legislative efforts and things going on between the Congress and the executive branch on -- how it relates to outcomes here. I just emphasize that our advocacy position, both in our own voice and as part of the industry voice, has been consistent around focusing on the markets that we serve and making sure that the final regulation does not have an adverse impact on the access of Americans to financial advice and to certain types of financial solutions, in particular guaranteed retirement income solutions. And that's been the consistent thrust of our efforts. The -- in terms of our own efforts to cope with the range of outcomes that could be -- that could come with the final regulation, those have been underway for some time and are very robust efforts. We have efforts in each of our most relevant businesses in this regard Prudential advisers, our Retirement business, our Annuities business. And we have oversight regarding all of those efforts and corporate-level coordination of all of those efforts. So that work is well underway. For reasons I've outlined earlier, I -- in earlier earnings calls, for example, I think our business mix and our business strategies will make us highly resilient in the face of a range of outcomes on the regulation. The -- in regard to quantifying any of those impacts, that's not something we're going to do in this call. I will say that any kind of expense increases around compliance requirements and the like has been factored into our guidance and is part of the guidance that we've provided on this. In regard to sales-level impact, in the Annuities business, for example, as Rob pointed out, it's true of most of our businesses, just about all of them, certainly true of the Annuities business, that earnings are really driven by the in-force. And even if there were a meaningful impact on sales in 2016 as a result of the regulation, that would not have a significant impact on the guidance we've provided.\n\n---\n\nJust a clarification on the higher expenses. So related to the recapture, I assumed there will be some expenses related to that effort. Would that be included in your kind of $0.15 expectation for higher expenses?\n\n---\n\nHumphrey, it's Rob. The higher expenses were essentially associated with initiatives and with regulatory costs, not with the recapture. To the extent that there are any expenses associated with that recapture, however, they are included in our guidance.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then in terms of, I think it was Slide 5, you talked about kind of roughly $3 billion of new funded business to offset anticipated annual runoff in retirement. Is the $3 billion referring just to the PRT deals or including everything else, including your normal kind of food [ph] service business as well.\n\n---\n\nHumphrey, the $3 billion refers to PRT runoff.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So just simply for the runoff for the PRT. It seems a little bit quicker than I would expect. Is there any color that you can provide?\n\n---\n\nLet me jump in on that. Actually, with the -- so one of the things that we often highlight about the pension risk transfer business is that it is entirely retired lives, and therefore, it has a relatively short duration and one of the reasons why we particularly like this business, which is that while we're taking on longevity risk, it's longevity risk without a significant amount of risk or variation in terms of expected outcomes. So what you find is that depending on the individual blocks of business that we have, either funded or the pure reinsurance transactions, you can have durations in there that are as short as 8 years and maybe as long as 10 to 12 years, but relatively short. So if you think about that duration, take 10 years, you're going to have about 1/10 of the portfolio rolling off. And so when you take that against the total block of business that we've done, you can sort of see that there is a substantial roll-down that need to be replaced with new blocks of business.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Thomas Gallagher (Analysts)】\nRob, first question on the annuity recapture for you is, I assume this won't change your view of excess capital because you're indicating CTE 97 is still the level you're going to capitalize the business at. But can you talk a little bit about what this would do to more of the cosmetics in terms of RBC? I assume the reserves will go down and equity will go up, if you're going to be using statutory instead of GAAP from a capitalization standpoint. Can you talk a bit about how the mechanics are going to work here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nTom, let me take that in 2 pieces, put the mechanics aside from the RBC and the capital implications. So as you said and as we've shared in the past, we've got total assets in our captives that are about twice the reserves that we're getting released from at the seeding company when we hold capital to CTE 97. And we do intend to continue to manage capital reserves associated with the living benefit rider economically going forward, consistent with that historical practice and consistent with our view of what's appropriate for our objectives of being AA rated. At this point in time, given the number of moving pieces and the complexity of that undertaking, Tom, we're not going to provide any further insight into how that may actually manifest itself in the statutory results. There is -- there are a number of intersecting pieces on that, that would make it a difficult question to answer at this point in time. Having said that, we're very comfortable that both from a statutory standpoint and an economic standpoint, that we have sufficient resources and that this will not have a negative outcome affecting either of those.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gallagher (Analysts)】\nBut just a follow-up on that, Rob. So is the right way to view this that it's likely to have a neutral to positive impact on overall enterprise-wide capital from an excess capital view standpoint? Or is it really just more neutral, because there's not really much of a change happening there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nWell, Tom, I go back to what I said. I think what we're comfortable saying at this point in time is that we're very comfortable that we can fully cover the net impact of the recapture with the existing capital and reserves that we have.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Gallagher (Analysts)】\nOkay, and then my follow-up is simply on the noncoupon investment returns. You're using 6% to 7% long term, and I assume, by modestly low or slightly lower near term, is 5% the number that you're assuming on that? And then the related question is, what is it about your noncoupon investments that you are assuming 6% to 7%? I think most of your peers on similar assets are using 8% to 10%. Is that you guys have more -- have less private equity in your noncoupon investments? Or is that something you could shed some light on?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nSo taking those in turn, Tom, I think what I indicated in my remarks upfront, we think it's going to be about a $0.05 in terms of the relative under-performance vis-à-vis the 6% targeted returns. So that's -- it's relatively modest, but we wanted to call that out. In terms of the composition of the portfolio and the basis for the 6% to 7%, I can't compare our alternative portfolio to our peers, but I can provide you a little bit of transparency what's in ours. The PE component of our alternatives is a little under 1/3 and hedge funds make up between -- up to about 15%. Real estate is about 20% of it. And then what we also include in there is our public equity portfolio. That exists primarily in our international operations vis-à-vis our domestic, and that accounts for about 1/3 of that overall alternative allocation. Blending that in, based on our view of what are sustainable levels of returns from those different classes of alternative securities, we think 6% to 7% is an appropriate level.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Erik Bass (Analysts)】\nJust one question on your PRT assumption. I know you've mentioned you're not assuming any jumbo transactions, but are you assuming some level of activity in 2015? Or would any transactions that you do be accretive to your assumptions?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Pelletier (Executives)】\nErik, this is Steve. No, we're assuming continued momentum in the business. As we've discussed before, the pipeline looks strong. The marketplace interest in the value proposition of pension risk transfer is strong and, I would say, growing. So we do expect the continued momentum and success in the business. What we wanted to emphasize was that if you're talking about jumbo transactions, we should probably use some more clarity around jumbo. If you're going to talk about the very large transactions of, say, $4 billion to $5 billion and above, I'm talking on the funded side here, we do not -- we did not incorporate anything like that into our guidance. But if you're talking about some of the transactions that have -- aside from the very large ones that we've done, if you're talking about some of the transactions that in recent periods, for example, have been the range in which we play at frequently in the market, say in $1 billion range, those we absolutely anticipate further success in that regard.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Erik Bass (Analysts)】\nAnd then just on the investment spending, can you just comment a little bit more on where you're making some of the investments? And will that run through the business segments? Or is part of that going through corporate?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nThis is Rob. So it's at both levels. So there is some level of corporate spending that's baked into those numbers, but there is not an insignificant amount that's down at the business unit level as well. And that investment spending, I think in the total number that we gave you in terms of the increase there, it also includes our regulatory spend. So -- and I would think about that as being -- roughly thinking about it as being half and half between what would be at the -- the increase that what would be at the house versus what you would find down at the business unit level.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Erik Bass (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then the business unit investments, it's primarily investment management, and where else would we see that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Pelletier (Executives)】\nYou'd see it in part in the investment management business, Erik, as you mentioned, but you'd also see it in terms of the investments we're making in our digital platform and data analytics across our businesses, and systems investments in some of the other domestic businesses. And Charlie will speak to the international dimension.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Lowrey (Executives)】\nYes, and then that's relatively true on the international side too. We have some end-of-life issues, but we also are making investments in systems to create better efficiencies and do things for customers to make it easier for them. So it's consistent amongst the businesses.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jamminder Bhullar (Analysts)】\nOn the technology and infrastructure spending, how should we think about those -- that level of expenses beyond 2016? It seems like technology and infrastructure-type spending should continue at a similar rate beyond 2016, but is that correct or not?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nJimmy, it's Rob. And yes, we -- our expectation is this is, as we spoke about it last year, it is a multi-year phenomena, so we should expect this elevated level of spending for the next couple of years in any event. And so in the foreseeable horizon, we'll continue to make these levels of investments. It will eventually drop back down, but not in the immediate future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jamminder Bhullar (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then on -- you didn't quantify the earnings impact from Habitat. But are you expecting any initial investments or integration spending or investments into the business that will dampen the earnings in the first few quarters that you have the business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Lowrey (Executives)】\nNo, we don't think so. This is an investment in a joint venture. We're extremely comfortable with Habitat. We very much like the company and the management, and therefore don't anticipate significant expenditures, once we make the acquisition of the joint venture interest.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jamminder Bhullar (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just lastly, on share repurchases, you've been fairly stable in how you've based the buybacks over time. Should we assume that'll continue even though your buyback number is going up a little bit from 2015 into '16?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nWe haven't changed our philosophy with regard to how we think about share buybacks. We've just changed the quantum, Jimmy.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Schwartz (Analysts)】\nRob, I was hoping first that you could just update us on the yen macro hedge, maybe the size of that gain now and how it's going to get paid out over time?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nSure. Well, what I would do in that respect is actually repeat or cover where we were as of the end of the third quarter because I can't really update you beyond that. So in terms of actually realized gains from the macro hedge, on an after-tax basis through the first 9 months of the year, we had about $400 million worth of harvested gains there. At the end of the third quarter, the mark-to-market on the yen hedge was at -- or roughly around $2.12 billion [ph]. A significant portion of that amortizes between the third quarter of this year and the end of 2017, about 3/4 of it actually will amortize over that period of time, or will be harvested over that period of time. As that occurs, that would then go into our capital capacity.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Schwartz (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then on the VA recapture, just a quick 2 there. Again, I want to try to follow up on what Tom was asking, and I think the effect on your views of excess capital following this. I think -- I guess, a yes or no. I think Tom's question really was, if you look at this on an economic basis, and presumably the 400 RBC capital spend that you had set up as a base was viewed as an economic standard, I mean, does this really have an effect on the excess capital from an economic standpoint, in your view?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nAgain, I'll repeat what I said before, Steven, is that when we bring this together, we think this is a more effective way to manage the risks that we have associated with the VA business, both the host contract and the rider. The -- and they're both -- there are operational efficiencies associated with doing it that way. And there is, as John indicated, it's a -- it reduces complexity and gives us greater flexibility for how we think about moving capital around the enterprise. The volatility that you've seen related to our annuities business in the back -- in the past has in part been driven by the fact that we don't have complete fungibility, and in any given quarter, our ability to move gains in one part of the organization to areas where they would be offset with losses in other starts -- in other parts of the organization. So we get that increased flexibility. Beyond that, I think when I go back to the statement, which is, when we look at the level of reserving that we do and the way in which we hold capital for this business, we think about then moving that over into the new construct, we're very comfortable that we have the appropriate levels of economic reserves and capital to manage this in the same way on a go-forward basis.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Schwartz (Analysts)】\nRob, just last one. Does the new structure -- does that mitigate kind of the capital swings associated with the shortage of straight position in the hedging?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nSo yes, that is in fact the point. So as we've looked at the way we've managed the rider within that captive, to the extent that there are -- in any given quarter, that we would have seen volatility in capital because we had losses within the captive, we would have gains in other parts of the organization. We were not necessarily able to offset those because we couldn't get the capital out of the areas in which we had gains and over into the areas, where -- in this case the captive, where we had the shortfall. By eliminating the captive and consolidating it back in with the host, we'll substantially mitigate that dynamic that you've seen in the past.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Yaron Kinar (Analysts)】\nI wanted to go back to the guidance, Slide 9. So the $9.75 to $10.25 range, you offer basically 3 buckets driving that: the market factors, core growth and capital deployment. Which of these buckets would really lead to you coming at the lower end versus of the higher end of that range?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nSo I think about it this way. If you look at each of those 3 buckets, start with the market bucket. I think we've given you the assumptions that are in there. So from a market standpoint, rates we indicated are having a negative impact of $0.15 to $0.20. And we've given some sensitivity metrics so that you can calibrate what would happen to that based on movements in the -- we've given you off the 10-year. We've, I think, given you some -- we've giving you the indication of our alternative performance against our expectations. There is a correlation of that performance with equity markets that drives a not insignificant component of that. And then we've given you our equity market assumption, which is about a 6% growth. So -- and we've given you sensitivities around that number as well. So to the extent that we're more than -- less than the 6%, you continue to do the calibrations there. So I think you've got a good sense for how the market component of this could contribute or detract from our growth, depending on how events actually play out against the assumptions that we have built in the forecast. With regard to the -- I'll go to the far right-hand side. The core growth is driven by all the things that we walked through upfront. Obviously, we can outperform our baseline expectations, but a lot of that is actually driven in large part by an installed book of business as opposed to incremental sales. And so while we think there is -- there could be variability around sales and upsides, it won't have as material an impact as what's driven from the embedded book, which brings you to the middle piece, which is capital deployment. And what we have there is we've given you some transparency, I think, at how some of that capital will be deployed: the Chilean acquisition, the increased level of buybacks. But where we are in the range will be influenced by how that capital is actually deployed during the -- excess capital is actually deployed during the year and the rate at which it's deployed.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Yaron Kinar (Analysts)】\nOkay. And this last part, actually, is a good segue to my second question. When we look at capital deployment opportunities or your appetite to deploy capital, are you also considering, let's say, blocks similar to what you did with Hartford a few years ago? I think there may be a few blocks out on the market now. Or is it mostly pension risk transfers and the Habitat?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Strangfeld (Executives)】\nThis is John. If you look back, we've --  you've seen a mix of those types of activities, and a series of these have had step-function impacts, whether it's large-scale PRT transactions or whether it's activities we have done with AIG, the Star and Edison, or whether it's Hartford, we're certainly open to those sorts of things. As we thought about our business, our sentiment around this is, there -- we like to do, not have to do. Meaning, we're feeling very focused on core businesses and the core growth prospects, and innovation, and execution, but we've shown a pattern over time, more in certain phases of the cycle than in others, of being opportunistic in a variety of different ways. And as Steve pointed out, it's hard -- in the PRT business, where large-scale activities are lumpy and unpredictable, it's just difficult and probably unwise to be layering them into financial planning. But certainly, we have an interest for that, and we certainly have the capacity for it as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Nadel (Analysts)】\nMy first question is just about the increase in the buyback authorization. I know money is fungible, but I'm curious. What's really specifically driving that? Is that just more confidence in the 60% free cash flow? Or is there some element there that we should be considering related to the monetization of the yen equity hedge? I ask this specifically because I think, over time -- excuse my voice, the equity hedge is intended to provide an offset to the translation impact of a weaker yen on your operating income. But if we look at Slide 9, you're clearly showing us a 2.5% to 3% headwind from currency. So I'm just wondering how to think about the increase in the buyback authorization.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nJohn, it's Rob. So let me try to address that for you. I would think about the buybacks, first and foremost, being consistent with the 21% increase in the dividend. And both the dividend and the buybacks reflect a couple of things. One, it's confidence in the strength of our balance sheet. It is driven by the increased level of earnings translating into free cash flow. We previously gave guidance that, that number was around 50%, and we increased that most recently to the 60% number. That's about a 20% increase, sort of not inconsistent with the level of increase that we did in our dividend. But it also is, in part, the harvesting of the yen equity hedge gains. As I mentioned, when Tom or whoever asked the earlier question, we've realized about $400 million after tax of that in the first 9 months of the year. We still got another $2 billion out there. And interestingly, I think when I provided how much of that was actually maturing, it's about 50% of that, that I think matures through the end of 2017. But we understand and have communicated to you that, that yen equity hedge us is designed and calibrated so, over time, the gains from the hedge can be redeployed to offset any dilution in earnings resulting from a depreciation in the yen. That doesn't happen immediately. There is a lag. As we're harvesting and realizing, it has to be redeployed, and the actual harvesting doesn't line up entirely with the dilution associated with the earnings. But if you look over a multiyear period of time, what you will find is that the redeployment of capital, either in the form of acquisitions or buybacks, will be well correlated to the dilution that we're seeing in earnings per share from the yen. And so you should expect those things over time to offset.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Nadel (Analysts)】\nSo then if I could summarize it this way, Rob, would this be a reasonable expectation? We can think about capital return or deployment, dividends plus buybacks, around 60%, and then plus or minus whatever the change in the yen hedge may be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nWell, we look at buybacks as being a variable, not a set-in-stone number. It is -- when we look at capital redeployment, we look at the variety of ways in which we may go about doing that. So to the extent that there are opportunities either within the business, super organic growth opportunities like we've talked about with PRT, or there should be exogenous things like acquisitions, we would -- we might alter the level of buybacks that we're doing in order to finance those. And similarly, to the extent that we're anticipating that those sort of the things we're holding capital in order to have the flexibility to pursue them but they don't manifest, we might alter it in the other way. So I would say, we don't want to become overly programmatic about the direction we would give on that, but I think what you should think about is we generate a lot of capital, 60% of earnings every year, and that we're good stewards of that capital don't tend to hoard it, but rather redeploy it to the benefit of shareholders.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Nadel (Analysts)】\nAnd then the last real quick one is just on Habitat. Since you announced the deal -- and boy, it's been some time now, the Chilean peso has weakened considerably versus the U.S. dollar. I'm just wondering how we should think about the cash outlay, assuming this thing is going to close in the next couple of months. If the Chilean peso didn't move from here versus the dollar, do we think about a cash outlay here that's going to be substantially less than what you had originally announced?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Lowrey (Executives)】\nI think we give you a range before of about $530 million to $620 million, and we feel comfortable with that range. We have not hedged the acquisition. So obviously, there will be a benefit in terms of U.S. dollars. But it'll be -- that's the range we gave. We feel comfortable with that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jay Gelb (Analysts)】\nMy first question is on Slide 8, talking about the 2015 adjusted baseline results. Could you give us some more insight on what that $0.20 to $0.30 EPS headwind would be from seasonally increased expenses?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nSo you're talking about bridge to the full year basis. That's the -- I think the number we gave was -- yes, the $0.20 to $0.30 adjustment from our third quarter run rate. Is that what you're referring to, Jay?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jay Gelb (Analysts)】\nCorrect.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nYes. So I'll actually turn that over to both Charlie and to Steve to talk about sort of the seasonality that exists with the International and the U.S. businesses. Specifically at a corporate level, we tend to have a higher level of expenses at corporate in the fourth quarter. It reflects things like some of the spending that we do and accruals that we make that are catch-up's, tend to get caught up in the fourth quarter and therefore not evenly distributed during the course of the year, but it's also driven by level of expenditures that we have down at the businesses. So Charlie and Steve?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Lowrey (Executives)】\nSure, I'll go first. It's Charlie. In terms of the International business, you do you have seasonal expenses that sort of come in the fourth quarter. One of the obvious ones is mailings. So you have a mailing that happens in the fourth quarter every year, especially in Japan. We have a lot of customers, and actually, that's a fair amount of money. You also have some technology and systems cost that tend to be back-ended and spent in the fourth quarter. So it's a variety of different things. It's nothing in particular, but it is consistent and it is -- it does happen.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Pelletier (Executives)】\nAnd Jay, the answer on the domestic side would be very similar. I'd say principal driver of fourth quarter seasonality of expenses is mailings. That's when we're sending out a lot of contractual materials, a lot of disclosure-type materials, and that's reflected in our fourth quarter historical seasonally high expense level.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jay Gelb (Analysts)】\nOkay. So Rob, I might be overly simplistic about this. But if I look at your 2015 baseline of between $9.50, $9.60 versus the third quarter year-to-date 2015 baseline result of $7.35, the difference at the midpoint is around $2.20. Is that the right way we should think about the outlook for 4Q?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nYes, I cannot comment on outlook for 4Q. We did not provide this analytic as a way to give you a view toward where 2015 would turn out, but rather to establish a basis upon which we could talk about 2016, without giving any forward-looking guidance on our results for the fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jay Gelb (Analysts)】\nOkay. I mean, the Street's just above that. And then the second, I guess, broader issue is, I'm just seeing some reports come out that there is likely -- that the Democrats are likely to block the fiduciary rule from being part of the omnibus spending bill. And given kind of that breaking perspective, I think it'd be helpful to get Prudential's view on where we're headed with the fiduciary standards proposal.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Pelletier (Executives)】\nJay, this is Steve. I wouldn't venture to comment on the different legislative efforts and things going on between the Congress and the executive branch on -- how it relates to outcomes here. I just emphasize that our advocacy position, both in our own voice and as part of the industry voice, has been consistent around focusing on the markets that we serve and making sure that the final regulation does not have an adverse impact on the access of Americans to financial advice and to certain types of financial solutions, in particular guaranteed retirement income solutions. And that's been the consistent thrust of our efforts. The -- in terms of our own efforts to cope with the range of outcomes that could be -- that could come with the final regulation, those have been underway for some time and are very robust efforts. We have efforts in each of our most relevant businesses in this regard Prudential advisers, our Retirement business, our Annuities business. And we have oversight regarding all of those efforts and corporate-level coordination of all of those efforts. So that work is well underway. For reasons I've outlined earlier, I -- in earlier earnings calls, for example, I think our business mix and our business strategies will make us highly resilient in the face of a range of outcomes on the regulation. The -- in regard to quantifying any of those impacts, that's not something we're going to do in this call. I will say that any kind of expense increases around compliance requirements and the like has been factored into our guidance and is part of the guidance that we've provided on this. In regard to sales-level impact, in the Annuities business, for example, as Rob pointed out, it's true of most of our businesses, just about all of them, certainly true of the Annuities business, that earnings are really driven by the in-force. And even if there were a meaningful impact on sales in 2016 as a result of the regulation, that would not have a significant impact on the guidance we've provided.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Humphrey Lee (Analysts)】\nJust a clarification on the higher expenses. So related to the recapture, I assumed there will be some expenses related to that effort. Would that be included in your kind of $0.15 expectation for higher expenses?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nHumphrey, it's Rob. The higher expenses were essentially associated with initiatives and with regulatory costs, not with the recapture. To the extent that there are any expenses associated with that recapture, however, they are included in our guidance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Humphrey Lee (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then in terms of, I think it was Slide 5, you talked about kind of roughly $3 billion of new funded business to offset anticipated annual runoff in retirement. Is the $3 billion referring just to the PRT deals or including everything else, including your normal kind of food [ph] service business as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nHumphrey, the $3 billion refers to PRT runoff.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Humphrey Lee (Analysts)】\nOkay. So just simply for the runoff for the PRT. It seems a little bit quicker than I would expect. Is there any color that you can provide?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Robert Falzon (Executives)】\nLet me jump in on that. Actually, with the -- so one of the things that we often highlight about the pension risk transfer business is that it is entirely retired lives, and therefore, it has a relatively short duration and one of the reasons why we particularly like this business, which is that while we're taking on longevity risk, it's longevity risk without a significant amount of risk or variation in terms of expected outcomes. So what you find is that depending on the individual blocks of business that we have, either funded or the pure reinsurance transactions, you can have durations in there that are as short as 8 years and maybe as long as 10 to 12 years, but relatively short. So if you think about that duration, take 10 years, you're going to have about 1/10 of the portfolio rolling off. And so when you take that against the total block of business that we've done, you can sort of see that there is a substantial roll-down that need to be replaced with new blocks of business.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to this conference call on our operational update for the 10 months ended 31 October, 2015, which we published this afternoon at 2:30. I'm joined on this call by Finance Director, Kobus Möller; and Wikus Olivier, Head Group Finance. \r\nLet me first deal with the overview of results. The group delivered an overall solid performance for the 10 months through 31 October, 2015, despite the very challenging conditions. The details of the results for the 10-month period are included in the [indiscernible] announcement released at 2:30 today.\r\nBut I would just like to highlight a few points before we proceed to questions. In terms of the environment, as anticipated, the headwinds we faced in the first half of the year continued to impact on the performance of the group for the 10-month period. Economic conditions remain challenging in the largely commodity-based economies where we operate. South Africa, our largest market is performing very poorly in the economy, with less than 2% growth expected in 2015, which, together with inflationary pressure, impacts negatively on disposable income. \r\nNow the middle income market is worst hit by these conditions. And that is evident in the lower-than-expected growth in new business volumes on this segment. As has been the case in the last few years, new business growth in the affluent and entry-level market, that remains more resilient. And here, the affluent market continues to benefit from the relatively strong investment market performances over the past few years.\r\nIn the entry-level market, sales continue to be supported by lower levels relative of industrial action, higher-than-expected wage settlement in the public sector and a couple of large one-off items. In particular, this year is that you see biannual renewal in large group scheme has risen in Sanlam Sky during the 10-month period. \r\nWe didn't highlight in the interim results announcement that Zambia and Kenya are experiencing difficult years, and this continued to be reflected in the 10-month performance. And here, a major recovery is not expected until next year.\r\nAs also we advised at the half year, additional provisions have been raised by Sanlam in respect of the Shriram Equipment Finance book. On a net basis, the additional provisions are more or less in line with the provisions raised in the first half of the year.\r\nAnd finally, lower performance fees and an increase in administration costs relating to outsourcing and some capacity building in the institutional markets and marketing continued to impact on the operational earnings of Sanlam Investments.\r\nIn the 10-month period, Sanlam Personal Finance and Santam in particular delivered a very solid result. In fact, in the Santam case, we would consider that to be a really outstanding 10-month result. Some of the salient features of our performance are as follows: new business volumes increased by 17%; and in effect, that's 24% with the large Employee Benefits bulk annuity policy, which was written in 2014, if we normalize for that. \r\nNet fund flows are down on 2014 as previously advised due to withdrawals by the PIC in South Africa and the Botswana Public Officers Pension Fund impacting on the Sanlam Emerging Markets results. VNB is slightly up in the first 10 months of 2014 if we normalize for the SEB policy. But here trends are broadly in line with the first half results, apart from -- in the 4-month period, we did have some higher-than-expected replacement sales of the newly launched tax-free savings product in the entry-level market. It's because of the change in mix results, lower VNB contribution in Sanlam Sky. \r\nNet operating earnings increased by some 8%, which was ahead of where we were at the half year. \r\nIn conclusion therefore, looking for the remaining period, which is 2 months, we expect a challenging environment to persist. We also had a very high operating earnings base in the second half of 2014. And we, at this stage, we would not see growth in the metrics being maintained at the current levels. And on top of that, one has to remember that in Santam's case, where we've had an excellent performance, that is also a risk to a degree in the last 2 months, which is traditionally the hail season in parts of South Africa.\r\nWe are confident that our medium to long-term growth prospects remain intact and we will deliver value by implementing our services to our shareholders.\r\nWe also look forward to finalizing a number of transactions, which we've announced over the past few months, which includes Saham acquisition, which we announced last week and the 23% additional stakes in Shriram Life and Shriram General as well as the acquisition of the minority stake in AfroCentric, which is the holding company of Medscheme. \r\nThank you. I will now open the call for questions from the audience.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tony Maslowski, Chief Financial Officer of Avago Technologies.\r\nAfter the market closed today, Avago distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Avago's website at www.avagotech.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and a recording will be available via telephone playback for 1 week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at avagotech.com.\r\nDuring the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tony will be providing details of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 results, background to our first quarter fiscal year 2016 outlook and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.\r\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Avago reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.\r\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Ashish. Good afternoon, everyone. I will start with a short summary of fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 business highlights, and Tony will continue with more details on our financial results.\r\nSo fiscal 2015 was an important year for Avago, where we saw a significant increase in our top line from a full year of LSI contribution, augmented by strong growth in wireless revenue. On this expanded base, we drove higher levels of profitability through leveraging our larger scale, continual richer product mix and the full achievement of LSI acquisition cost synergies to deliver operating margins over 40%. In other words, mission accomplished.\r\nOur fourth quarter results exemplified this loud and clear. Revenue came in at $1.85 billion, a 6% sequential increase, and I continue to be very pleased with our execution, which drove the fourth quarter margins above the high end of our range and earnings per share to $2.51. We ended our fiscal year on a very strong note, delivering record levels of revenue and profitability.\r\nLet us now turn to discussion of our segments, starting with wireless. In the fourth quarter, the wireless segment represented 37% of our total revenue from continuing operations in this very typical strong seasonal fourth quarter. As we expected during this seasonal upturn, revenue from our wireless segment grew by 10% sequentially, with the customary product ramp at our North American customer partially offset by the product cycle rollover at one of our large Asian customers. While there was an increase in overall RF content in the new phone model, our -- Avago's RF content on a dollar basis in the new phone model remained largely flat, the same as it was in the prior generation. We had to walk away from supplying additional RF content in the new phone model because of a constrained filter manufacturing capacity. This will not happen again.\r\nOur long-term expectation for our wireless business remains very strong, and we expect our RF content per smartphone to increase at over 20% every year. We have concrete plans in place to address this. We remain on track with our plan to increase FBAR filter capacity in fiscal 2016 by 50% as we convert our fab from 6-inch to 8-inch wafer manufacturing. We also expect our Fort Collins fab to remain at near full capacity as we start to prebuild inventory to support anticipated new phone launches later in fiscal 2016.\r\nNow looking more short term at the first fiscal quarter 2016. Unlike last year, we see -- we do see a seasonal decline in demand and expect our wireless revenue to sequentially decline in the low teens on a percentage basis. Last year, first quarter demand had held up, offsetting normal seasonality, but we don't see the same phenomenon this year. And therefore, on a year-on-year basis, we expect our wireless segment revenue to also decline similar to the sequential drop.\r\nWhile that is just one part of our portfolio, let me now turn to another segment of our portfolio which has been performing rather amazing, and that's our enterprise storage segment. In the fourth quarter, enterprise storage revenue grew by 9% sequentially, and enterprise storage represented 35% of our total revenue from continuing operations. In the fourth quarter, we also saw strong growth from our RAID and SaaS products. We also benefited from increasing shipments into enterprise and data center hard disk drives. Despite macro worries, enterprise storage market held up quite well in fiscal 2015, and in fact, our core enterprise storage revenues in the fourth quarter grew close to 20% on a year-on-year basis.\r\nLooking towards first quarter 2016, we expect this segment to maintain its momentum from the strong fourth quarter, and we expect revenue to be up slightly on a sequential basis. We also believe we may be gaining share in this segment.\r\nOn to wired infrastructure. In the fourth quarter, wired revenue grew by 2% sequentially, and our wired segment represented approximately 20% of our total revenue from continuing operations. The ASIC business was up slightly in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by an increase in shipments into routing, especially edge routing. Our fiber optics business, after a strong third quarter, maintained much of its momentum into the fourth quarter, delivering a small sequential increase. We saw increase in fiber-to-the-home shipments and stable deliveries into the enterprise OEM market. The addition of wafer fab capacity at our Breinigsville, Pennsylvania, edge-emitting laser facility helped us better meet the increasing demand for fiber-to-the-home market. In the final -- in the next quarter, first quarter, we expect sustained performance from this segment and project our revenue to also be up slightly here.\r\nMoving on to industrial. In the fourth quarter, industrial and other miscellaneous products represented 8% of our total revenues from continuing operations. Focusing on industrial, resales held up reasonably well during the quarter and were in fact up slightly. By region, Asia Pacific was quite strong with resales growing close to double digits. Europe also grew by near mid-single digits sequentially, but the Americas and Japan were both weak and resales declined in the mid to single digits sequentially in those regions.\r\nHowever, similar to a number of peers, we saw -- we took a cautionary tone from customers during the quarter and consequently reduced shipments into our distributors, which drove channel inventory down. As a result, our industrial segment revenue declined by 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter. And please keep in mind, we recognize revenue here on a sell-in basis. As we look at first quarter, anticipating normal seasonal decline as well as, of course, lingering macro uncertainty, we plan to continue to reduce inventory in distribution. And accordingly, we expect revenue for industrial segment to decline in the low single digits sequentially.\r\nIn summary, therefore, after a strong close to fiscal 2015, we expect an approximate 4% sequential decline in consolidated first quarter 2016 revenue, driven primarily by seasonality in our wireless and industrial segments, offsetting projected sustained performance from our wired and enterprise storage segments.\r\nWith the LSI integration completed in fiscal 2015, we have created a very powerful business model that leverage our larger scale and increase diversity to deliver strong growth in earnings for the year. As Tony will provide more color on this in his summary, we expect our earnings strength to carry over into the first fiscal quarter regardless of revenue seasonality. And as we go into the rest of fiscal 2016, we expect this earnings machine to further strengthen with the pending Broadcom acquisition.\r\nWith this in mind, I'd like to mention that the Broadcom acquisition process continue to progress very smoothly, and day 1 integration planning continue -- planning, including identification of all key business leaders and supporting teams, have -- has been completed. We have made very good progress, in fact, on the regulatory approval front and expect to be in a position to close the transaction early in the first calendar quarter of 2016. In fact, we believe that we could present an integrated set of financial results starting with our second quarter of fiscal 2016.\r\nWith that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 financials. Tony?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.avagotech.com.\r\nRevenue of $1.85 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter represents an increase of 6% from the prior quarter. Foxconn was a greater-than-20% customer in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 62%, which was above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to better revenue mix and continued high fab utilization.\r\nTurning to operating expenses. R&D expenses were $257 million and SG&A expenses were $81 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of $338 million, $2 million above guidance, primarily due to higher bonus accruals driven by higher profitability. On a percentage basis, total operating expenses were 18% of revenues, a reduction from 19% in the prior quarter. As a percentage of sales, R&D was 14% and SG&A was 4% of net revenue.\r\nOperating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $811 million and represented 44% of net revenue. Taxes came in at $43 million for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter net income was $737 million and earnings per diluted share were $2.51. Fourth quarter interest expense was $41 million. Other income, net, was $10 million, resulting from a number of items, including cash from a legal settlement, interest income and gains from foreign exchange hedging.\r\nOur share-based compensation in the fourth quarter was $63 million. The breakdown of the expense for the fourth quarter includes $7 million in cost of goods sold, $30 million in R&D and $26 million in SG&A. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $65 million. Just as a reminder, our definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense. The non-GAAP guidance from first quarter fiscal 2016 also excludes estimated ticking fees of approximately $47 million related to debt commitments for the pending Broadcom acquisition.\r\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding were 50 days, an increase of 8 days from the prior quarter, caused by linearity of our revenue across the quarter. Our inventory ended at $524 million, a $17 million increase from the third quarter. Days on hand were 68 days. We generated $582 million in operational cash flow and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 billion, which increased by approximately $400 million from the prior quarter.\r\nOur fourth -- in our fourth quarter, we spent $106 million on capital expenditures. On September 30, 2015, we paid a cash dividend of $0.42 per ordinary share, which consumed $116 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter.\r\nSince the inception of our dividend program in the second quarter of 2011 to date, our financial performance has allowed us to increase our dividend each quarter. As a reminder, our board reviews and determines our dividend policy on a quarterly basis, based on our financial performance and condition, the contractual provisions related to our outstanding indebtedness and other factors deemed relevant by our board.\r\nNow let me briefly recap our fiscal year 2015 full year results. Net revenues increased by 60% year-over-year to $6.9 billion, benefiting primarily from a full year of contributions from continuing operations of the LSI businesses as well as strength in our wireless business. Gross margin increased 5% year-over-year to 61%, driven by an improvement in product mix with higher contributions from our FBAR-related wireless products as well as comparatively higher gross margins from the enterprise storage segment. Net income for fiscal 2015 increased to $2.6 billion or $8.98 per diluted share as compared to $1.3 billion or $4.90 per diluted share in fiscal 2014.\r\nNow let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only.\r\nNet revenue is expected to be $1.78 billion plus or minus $25 million. Gross margin is expected to be 61% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $314 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $40 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $37 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 295 million shares.\r\nThat concludes my prepared remarks. However, I would like to make one final comment. Earlier this week, Avago became 10 years old as an independent company. Just as a contrast to today's results, our first year in operations, we had $1.51 billion in revenue and a non-GAAP net loss of $108 million. I would like to personally thank all employees for their hard work and contributions in this first decade.\r\nOperator, please open up the call for questions.",

      "transcript_text3": "Hock, you mentioned on the wireless business that on the next year's flagship model you expect at least 20% higher content. Can you give us some context, what is driving that higher content? And what is your differentiation and competitive advantage versus, say, another competitor who also has BAW filters and is also adding capacity? What can you do consistently that they cannot? So what's really driving up content? And what's your competitive advantage?\n\n---\n\nWell, let's start with content. Content keeps increasing in smartphones, especially the higher-end smartphones, because of, as I say, increasing number of bands, spectral bandwidth that come into play worldwide as carriers expand the bandwidth by which they connect phones, connect us to each other. A number of especially LTE bands are increasing even in places like Japan, where you have new introduction of new bands, band 21, which have not existed before. And of course, the same applies in China, where you have both TDD and FDD as well. So it's really the proliferation of LTE bands and for high-end smartphones, the need for the creation [ph], especially towards the higher end, for phones that can roam. Adding on to this mix is the fact that 2 other things are happening that drives not just RF content, but our particular kind of RF content which is a form of FBAR filters, which allows signals to be received or transmitted in extremely discrete, very narrow -- on a very accurate or, call it, narrow base switches. The problem of -- with that number of bands in one little device, you start to create the phenomenon of coexistence. And coexistence, which exists and exists not across cellular bands alone, but across WiFi, Bluetooth as well, crossing cellular bands, too, that coexistence issue creates a specific need for filters that can extract signals from a very cluttered air space from ether [ph]. Then, of course, you hear now about downlink carrier aggregation, and next year on, you'll start to see some of -- certain phone models with uplink carrier aggregation. Those -- what carrier aggregation meant, and I may have discussed it in previous calls, is simply the ability to max [ph] or de-max [ph] multiple bands -- signals from multiple bands into one single channel in the phone or out, externally. And in order to do that, you need components, you need filters that are able to do the maxing [ph] and de-maxing [ph] in the RF space. And that's where FBAR filters come into their own. So because of all that, we had been consistently seeing over the last several years, and we see that trend continue over the next 3 years because it's as far as we can probably look with a degree of certainty, the increase in content -- in RF content and in particular, in the need for filters, which are not able to be integrated into one single chip. Each filter is a very discrete element. So that's pretty much what's driving what I postulate as perhaps a trend of 20% a year increase in dollar content of RF over the next several years for high-end smartphones. Okay?\n\n---\n\nAs my follow-up, Hock, you also mentioned good growth in your enterprise storage business. That's very different from some of the more sluggish, weak enterprise spending environment trends that we have heard from others. So I'm wondering, what is helping you outgrow the broader spending environment in enterprise?\n\n---\n\nThat's a very good question, and sometimes we sit there and wonder ourselves, by the way. All we do know is it is -- and I suspect in specific areas, there is market share gains on our side simply because we do a better product, simply because we're able to execute on better products. Also, we've been perhaps fortunate in being focused on certain customers, certain OEM customers in particular, that have done better than others and that allows us through that process by itself to gain share. And we build -- display that because, yes, we're fully aware of what's out there, what we hear out there on the macro side. But we are seeing strength particularly on the enterprise front, less so the cloud data center side. So maybe that's something to do with that as well.\n\n---\n\nI had a question on the FBAR capacity expansion, in particular, the move from 6 inch to 8 inch. I know it's early on, but that is an important factor for wireless growth in the back half of fiscal 2016. So can you just give us some early insight in terms of how that's progressing and the confidence of bringing that online?\n\n---\n\nThat has been progressing very much very well. And to be direct about it, we're almost ready now, give it a few more months for the back half and -- but there will not be a full completion for back half. We would anticipate continuing that migration from 6 inch to 8 inch of our existing lines through even our first half of 2017 in anticipation of the generation of phones in 2017, not -- late 2017, not just 2016. But we're pretty prepared right now.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And as my follow-up, good to hear that the integration of Broadcom is going smoothly and day 1 you could hit the ground running. Curious to get your thoughts more on the product side if you had more time to look at the portfolio, anything standout to you positively, particularly with the networking business and the prospects there?\n\n---\n\nOh, we love their products. We love their engineering. And it validates entirely our premise, our investment thesis in making this acquisition as far as we found so far. So we like a lot of what they're doing. To be more specific, might be a bit premature, sorry about that, but I'm not in a position to really disclose it. I frankly want to do it, not because I don't want to, but I think I'm not totally in the picture 100% until we really do have the operations under our control after day 1.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions. First, Tony, I noticed that operating expenses are declining, I think about 7% in the January period, which really stood out to me. Can you talk a little bit about that?\n\n---\n\nSure. It's mostly due to 2 factors. We completely completed the Emulex transition, so there's some OpEx drop-off from that. But more significantly, it's the reset on the bonus accrual. So on the bonus side, we're significantly above 100% attainment and that gets reset into Q1 at 100%, so you get some benefit from that as well. Now just to give you some perspective in 10 years of working here with the bonus is that it's not reset to last year's numbers. We have new numbers that are a little bit stretch targets for next year. So every year that we accomplish over 100% is a pretty Herculean feat. So it's not that we go into it saying we're going to earn 150% in the next year and you'll have kind of expense catch up at the second half of the year. So it's a true reset, and those are the 2 reasons for the expense drop-off.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Helpful. And Hock, you gave us a couple data points on wireless. You said that RF content in high-end phones would increase at 20% or so. And then you also told us that you're planning to increase capacity by about 50%. So putting those 2 data points together, how do we think about expectations for the wireless business, how fast it grows in fiscal '16?\n\n---\n\nWell, I don't know. I cannot really answer for fiscal '16 because we don't give guidance, Romit, on an annual basis. But I tell you, the trajectory we have been seeing and continues, I believe, to be on. And I second [ph] things in my opening remarks to clarify why this year, this end of '15, early '16, as we sit here, why it's more of an exception, a hiatus, I call it, than the rule. But content, as we farm [ph] in all this additional spectral bandwidth into a single piece -- a single device, has increased content-wise, physical content. My -- what we are seeing is anywhere from 30% to almost 50% every year, compounded every year. And -- but then there's always a value to some level of integration in terms of dollar translation, which is why in dollar terms, that content increase of 30% to 50% typically translates to, I think, 20% to 30% on an annual basis. That's really what it comes down to.\n\n---\n\nI had a question on the RF side, and as you look at China, where probably handsets don't have much of carrier aggregation today, where do you see carrier aggregation penetration in China by the end of next year?\n\n---\n\nThere's probably some, but there is some carrier aggregation -- a high level of carrier aggregation going on in China right now. Not as much perhaps as out here in the U.S., but there is, and there's a need to do that because that's where the operators in China were and want to go. And so we are seeing that now and we are selling some products, some more discrete module products that addresses downlink carrier aggregation. Uplink, that's a different method. Down, probably out for a couple of years at least, if not longer, for China. Uplink will happen here and some parts of the world faster, but downlink carrier aggregation is already happening in China.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And on the fab side, as you talk about 8-inch capacity, is it -- do you already have output on 8-inches fab [ph]?\n\n---\n\nWe have at this point what we call pilot lines. We have been doing the conversion over the past 12 months. It's really more investment and developing the process. We're at a point that we are starting to go into production fairly soon.\n\n---\n\nHock, back on the wireless side of things, you mentioned that the capacity constraint was never going to happen again and then you're kind enough to give us that 20% increase number. Is part of that 20% increase just simply your ability to address the sockets that you're limited on today? Or is that above and beyond the content increase that you're going to get on average with RF in the phones?\n\n---\n\nNo, and basically, it's almost one and the same. [indiscernible] trying to be too arrogant or [indiscernible], but it is one and the same because in order to integrate that kind of increase of content into a tiny little device and do it very well, not many people can do it, is our view. And so as I say, it becomes almost one and the same, which is our perception of the trend, last 3 years and forward 3 years, is that content keeps growing up. It keeps growing in that range, at least in dollar terms, and we are always able to capture that. But it's a broad trend, we believe, in the high-end smartphone market, and we do not see that changing over the next 3 years as it has been happening -- as has been happening the last 3 years.\n\n---\n\nAnd I guess as my follow-up, another one for you, Hock, and I know you're not going to give full year guidance, and maybe it doesn't even matter once Broadcom comes into the mix. But as you look at your 4 segments, can you just walk us through some of the areas that you're most excited about going up in fiscal '16, and then areas where you think there might be some headwinds as you look at your current portfolio of businesses?\n\n---\n\nI'm actually most excited about networking, wired infrastructure, so to speak, and very excited about -- continue to be excited about wireless. And enterprise storage has been, as I mentioned, performing very well and I'll be very pleased, but totally not disappointed if it doesn't hit the level it did in 2015 in enterprise storage. But definitely in wired and wireless, I'm -- I believe those 2 areas will continue to grow and grow very well.\n\n---\n\nHock, clearly, there is a tailwind on the wireless side, and you have executed very well within that. I was just having a tough time understanding and trying to reconcile what you said at the top of the call regarding the capacity. So you were constrained by capacity, and so you said that you walked away from certain business. And I'm assuming that can't be at the high end because you have a very differentiated product at the high end. So what gives you the confidence then that the competition or the customer will come back to you for that content that you could not provide? And then I had a quick follow-up.\n\n---\n\nBecause we are very good at what we do and we are just about one of very few people who can do what we say we do here. And really my purpose in explaining that at the beginning was that because this quarter and last, we saw, as you saw, a sort of a pause in that 20% growth rate year-on-year. And I took the pains to explain that as basically as not about people catching up as much as our inability capacity-wise to meet all of that need for this particular short window of time. But otherwise it's, in fact, the content that demand will still keep going at that rough 20% a year rate.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Okay. My follow-up then on the tax side, Tony. Should we -- I just want to make sure I get it right. So we should use the baseline from the guide for the Q1 because...\n\n---\n\nYes, so everything we have right now, and again, this is assuming in a model that -- no Broadcom. So I mean, in a full year, if you do just us, it's this new run rate. We'll have our midyear merit increases, which is a couple of percent. And then if we outperform our businesses, you'll see some bonus catch up in the second half. So yes, this is the -- I would consider this a stable run rate. Again, we throw that all out the window when we do Q2 and we start integrating Broadcom. So...\n\n---\n\nI guess, Hock, sorry to beat a dead horse here a little bit, but I'm getting a sense that your approach to the FBAR business may have changed here with your commentary about not wanting to supply constrain the market going forward. I did notice intra-quarter in the news, you guys procured a large factory up in Oregon. I believe it was cited as being for wireless. Can you give us sort of maybe the timing of getting Oregon up and running and whether you have, in fact, changed your strategy to not supply constrain the FBAR market? And if so, how quickly do you think you'll remove that constraint?\n\n---\n\nWell, I guess our strategy was never to want to constrain the market, first of all, to make that clear. What probably I'm implying, the corollary to what you just said and it's true on what I just said, is we are seeing the market grow even faster than we had originally thought. And again, consistent, we've done one thing to constrain the market we want to address, those specific high-end smartphone markets. We are taking steps to make sure we will never constrain it again.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Moving on...\n\n---\n\nAnd that includes that potential fab up in Oregon, just to complete that thought and tying with what you said. Yes, that plan of ours to address that longer term includes that facility, and that's a long-term plan because we don't expect that to -- once we get that going, if we get that going, that won't come into play -- come into line until more towards 2018. 2016 and '17, what we have in Fort Collins 8-inch conversion is pretty cool. '18, uncertainty. We better get this additional Oregon fab.\n\n---\n\nI guess as my follow-up, what capacity addition does that Oregon fab enable, if you could, on a percentage? Does that kind of double your FBAR capacity going forward?\n\n---\n\nWe generally don't want to disclose that, Doug, sorry.\n\n---\n\nHock, again, on wireless. I know you said you have visibility into the next 2 to 3 years on the design wins and also on the architectures. I'm just curious as to how much visibility you have on the pricing front because, obviously, to say that your content is increasing 20%, you got to assume some pricing curve. And the reason I'm asking is and given that your competitors are also adding capacity, what's the risk that your pricing assumptions could go wrong here?\n\n---\n\nOh, you're right. It's -- again, I'm approaching it from a very macro point of view and a very trend basis. And if you look at my trend and macro over the last 4 years, that 20% is what I've been achieving and have been able to achieve and achieving. And I think there's nothing really that we see out there, though I should never take it for granted because each one is an interesting challenge by itself. I'll be honest, the products we do in FBAR in front-end module, pets [ph], as I call them, are very, very difficult things to do. I mean, I'm not saying they are moon shots, but they're not that far from that. And we spend an enormous amount of money, talent doing it. So the best way to describe it is we don't see anything that dramatically changed, though each one is a tough one by itself. So as I've seen it the last 4 years, I'm basically commenting that it sure looks that for the next 2, 3 years, we'll see a continuation of this trend. And we see that, as I answer in an earlier question, through more bands, through the increasing issue of coexistence across bands in handsets, plus just as much the phenomenon of downlink and uplink carrier aggregation as operators need to run their network and base station much more efficiently. And all that is happening. It's not pie in the sky.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then, Tony, on the balance sheet side, I guess once you close the Broadcom deal, I think you told us you're going to have the leverage ratio around 2.5x or so. My question is, if an opportunity comes along to do additional M&A next year or some other time, first, what's your strategy in terms of additional M&A here? And then how much debt capacity you think you have?\n\n---\n\nYes, so taken in reverse order, we definitely have the debt capacity to go probably back to 3x or slightly above it. So you can think about, at any given time, we can be another turn here right out of the gate. However, the Broadcom acquisition, there will be a digestion phase for Broadcom. And as we've said, we don't wake up every morning looking for the next acquisition. We're very opportunistic on the acquisition front, and we'll look at it as we go. But again, I think we have flexibility with a starting point at 2.5x to do what we need to do, and if something opportunistic comes along, we'll take advantage of that.\n\n---\n\nQuestion from me. I guess, if I go back to the wireless segment, Hock, this should have been [ph] talked about. When you add capacity in the near term over the next 12 months, call it, are you doing it based on the design wins you have? Or do you have much more formed purchase commitments from your larger OEMs and hence, you're adding capacity?\n\n---\n\nIt's a judgmental process, and that judgment tends to be very tied to -- slant, bias conservatively. But you're right, it's tied to sockets, I believe in sockets that we will win over the next 12, 18 months. And you're right, sometimes we have to scramble to put capacity in place because of that kind of approach, but we believe that we prefer to be conservative than the other way around. But at the end of it all, it's all based on judgment, and we tend to be rather conservative in lagging capacity build-out behind what we see as demand. We might have, based on an earlier statement, started to behave a little differently. But basically, we are very conservative creatures is what we know we are. But it's all based on judgment and obviously, our judgment is that we will use up the capacity that we're putting in place for the next 2, 3 years.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then on the enterprise side, you talked about share gains and demonstrating [ph] better. I'm curious. Is that more on the HDD side? Or is that more the fiber channel adapters from Emulex where you think you might be picking up more share?\n\n---\n\nI think it's more on the connectivity side than the HDD side. HDD market doesn't change very much.\n\n---\n\nOn the wireless business, typically calendar Q1 is when your large Asian smartphone customer ramps production of its flagship platform. So the question is, are you seeing some of this ramp in your fiscal Q1, or is that typically seen in fiscal Q2? And then, Hock, in line with your commentary, are you anticipating 20% plus content gains on their new flagship smartphones?\n\n---\n\nI would say yes to all 3, yes. There is an uptick there, late Q1, probably Q2 fiscal, not calendar, fiscal Q2, more like fiscal Q2. And yes, we do see improvement in content.\n\n---\n\nThat's great. And then industrial, you had anticipated revenues to be down kind of low single digits in Q4. It came down 10% sequentially, but I think it's obviously a good decision to be prudent and take down inventories in the fourth quarter. As you think about Q1 and another quarter of inventory reduction, can you just help us understand your expectations for sell-through? And also, any commentary on demand by geography that you would expect in Q1?\n\n---\n\nYes, good point. Keep in mind, maybe first, simplest way to answer is our Q1 is November, December and January. So as you know -- as you probably know, industrial seasonality is down late -- end of the year and up again beginning of the year. So for Q1, we only have 1 month, not much. So that's why we continue to be -- to forecast and be conservative in our guidance of industrial revenue, whether they be resale or shipping. On the resale front, yes, we kind of see industrial -- it's hard to break out between seasonality versus secular in this case. All we see is that industrial is kind of struggling even to stay flat at this point. We saw -- our Q4, just to emphasize, was actually August, September, October. So we only saw part of the downturn of the back end of the year. And so that -- so even though our shipping was down, our resale, as I indicated, wasn't that bad. So I would expect our resale Q1 to be not so good, and that's why I used the word struggle to even stay flat, which is why we believe we better guide our shipping, which is our revenue, at down single digits. And we could have -- and not more or less, let's put it that way, because if the resale maybe down even more but our shipping is less because we already pulled down inventory last quarter.\n\n---\n\nHock, you said 8-inch will probably take you through the transition in about 2017. The Hynix fab in Portland probably wouldn't get turned on, I think you indicated till, what, 2018. It seems kind of to be the flat spot between the 2. I was just curious, the silicon SAW stuff that you've been working on, is that there to take up the slack, to take some of the pressure off your BAW fab by moving some of the lower-end stuff into that? Or is that more of a push by Avago to expand your filter offering beyond just traditional BAW into something maybe that would be more competitive in the SAW front? And I have a follow-up, please.\n\n---\n\nNo, I think we -- we think we have planned it pretty well because you're right, 8 inch will take us all the way through product generation of '17, which will just be in time for the fab up in Oregon to come in for '18. So it's straight on, and it's all largely focused on filters, all the sense [ph].\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then the 20% increase, I know it's more of a general number for the TAM growth over all, but it sounds like you're pretty enthusiastic about that for the next year. In 2015 [ph], as it specifically applies to Avago, will more of that come from, say, the max [ph] filters? And is that really a content gain like you're getting more parts? Or is it more of an ASP boost given how tough these are to do? Maybe not more die size itself, but you're just getting paid better for it?\n\n---\n\nNo, we're very nice people to our customers. We basically -- it'd be more content and we actually give a discount on a per filter basis. It's a lot more content, a lot more filters.\n\n---\n\nThank you, operator. Thank you for participating in today's earnings call. We look forward to talking with you again when we report our first quarter fiscal year 2016 financial results.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Vivek Arya (Analysts)】\nHock, you mentioned on the wireless business that on the next year's flagship model you expect at least 20% higher content. Can you give us some context, what is driving that higher content? And what is your differentiation and competitive advantage versus, say, another competitor who also has BAW filters and is also adding capacity? What can you do consistently that they cannot? So what's really driving up content? And what's your competitive advantage?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nWell, let's start with content. Content keeps increasing in smartphones, especially the higher-end smartphones, because of, as I say, increasing number of bands, spectral bandwidth that come into play worldwide as carriers expand the bandwidth by which they connect phones, connect us to each other. A number of especially LTE bands are increasing even in places like Japan, where you have new introduction of new bands, band 21, which have not existed before. And of course, the same applies in China, where you have both TDD and FDD as well. So it's really the proliferation of LTE bands and for high-end smartphones, the need for the creation [ph], especially towards the higher end, for phones that can roam. Adding on to this mix is the fact that 2 other things are happening that drives not just RF content, but our particular kind of RF content which is a form of FBAR filters, which allows signals to be received or transmitted in extremely discrete, very narrow -- on a very accurate or, call it, narrow base switches. The problem of -- with that number of bands in one little device, you start to create the phenomenon of coexistence. And coexistence, which exists and exists not across cellular bands alone, but across WiFi, Bluetooth as well, crossing cellular bands, too, that coexistence issue creates a specific need for filters that can extract signals from a very cluttered air space from ether [ph]. Then, of course, you hear now about downlink carrier aggregation, and next year on, you'll start to see some of -- certain phone models with uplink carrier aggregation. Those -- what carrier aggregation meant, and I may have discussed it in previous calls, is simply the ability to max [ph] or de-max [ph] multiple bands -- signals from multiple bands into one single channel in the phone or out, externally. And in order to do that, you need components, you need filters that are able to do the maxing [ph] and de-maxing [ph] in the RF space. And that's where FBAR filters come into their own. So because of all that, we had been consistently seeing over the last several years, and we see that trend continue over the next 3 years because it's as far as we can probably look with a degree of certainty, the increase in content -- in RF content and in particular, in the need for filters, which are not able to be integrated into one single chip. Each filter is a very discrete element. So that's pretty much what's driving what I postulate as perhaps a trend of 20% a year increase in dollar content of RF over the next several years for high-end smartphones. Okay?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vivek Arya (Analysts)】\nAs my follow-up, Hock, you also mentioned good growth in your enterprise storage business. That's very different from some of the more sluggish, weak enterprise spending environment trends that we have heard from others. So I'm wondering, what is helping you outgrow the broader spending environment in enterprise?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nThat's a very good question, and sometimes we sit there and wonder ourselves, by the way. All we do know is it is -- and I suspect in specific areas, there is market share gains on our side simply because we do a better product, simply because we're able to execute on better products. Also, we've been perhaps fortunate in being focused on certain customers, certain OEM customers in particular, that have done better than others and that allows us through that process by itself to gain share. And we build -- display that because, yes, we're fully aware of what's out there, what we hear out there on the macro side. But we are seeing strength particularly on the enterprise front, less so the cloud data center side. So maybe that's something to do with that as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Craig Hettenbach (Analysts)】\nI had a question on the FBAR capacity expansion, in particular, the move from 6 inch to 8 inch. I know it's early on, but that is an important factor for wireless growth in the back half of fiscal 2016. So can you just give us some early insight in terms of how that's progressing and the confidence of bringing that online?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nThat has been progressing very much very well. And to be direct about it, we're almost ready now, give it a few more months for the back half and -- but there will not be a full completion for back half.

We love their engineering. And it validates entirely our premise, our investment thesis in making this acquisition as far as we found so far. So we like a lot of what they're doing.

First, Tony, I noticed that operating expenses are declining, I think about 7% in the January period, which really stood out to me. Can you talk a little bit about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony Maslowski (Executives)】\nSure. It's mostly due to 2 factors.

And enterprise storage has been, as I mentioned, performing very well and I'll be very pleased, but totally not disappointed if it doesn't hit the level it did in 2015 in enterprise storage. But definitely in wired and wireless, I'm -- I believe those 2 areas will continue to grow and grow very well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ambrish Srivastava (Analysts)】\nHock, clearly, there is a tailwind on the wireless side, and you have executed very well within that. I was just having a tough time understanding and trying to reconcile what you said at the top of the call regarding the capacity. So you were constrained by capacity, and so you said that you walked away from certain business. And I'm assuming that can't be at the high end because you have a very differentiated product at the high end. So what gives you the confidence then that the competition or the customer will come back to you for that content that you could not provide? And then I had a quick follow-up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nBecause we are very good at what we do and we are just about one of very few people who can do what we say we do here. And really my purpose in explaining that at the beginning was that because this quarter and last, we saw, as you saw, a sort of a pause in that 20% growth rate year-on-year. And I took the pains to explain that as basically as not about people catching up as much as our inability capacity-wise to meet all of that need for this particular short window of time. But otherwise it's, in fact, the content that demand will still keep going at that rough 20% a year rate.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ambrish Srivastava (Analysts)】\nOkay. Okay. My follow-up then on the tax side, Tony. Should we -- I just want to make sure I get it right. So we should use the baseline from the guide for the Q1 because...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony Maslowski (Executives)】\nYes, so everything we have right now, and again, this is assuming in a model that -- no Broadcom. So I mean, in a full year, if you do just us, it's this new run rate. We'll have our midyear merit increases, which is a couple of percent. And then if we outperform our businesses, you'll see some bonus catch up in the second half. So yes, this is the -- I would consider this a stable run rate. Again, we throw that all out the window when we do Q2 and we start integrating Broadcom. So...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Douglas Freedman (Analysts)】\nI guess, Hock, sorry to beat a dead horse here a little bit, but I'm getting a sense that your approach to the FBAR business may have changed here with your commentary about not wanting to supply constrain the market going forward. I did notice intra-quarter in the news, you guys procured a large factory up in Oregon. I believe it was cited as being for wireless. Can you give us sort of maybe the timing of getting Oregon up and running and whether you have, in fact, changed your strategy to not supply constrain the FBAR market? And if so, how quickly do you think you'll remove that constraint?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nWell, I guess our strategy was never to want to constrain the market, first of all, to make that clear. What probably I'm implying, the corollary to what you just said and it's true on what I just said, is we are seeing the market grow even faster than we had originally thought. And again, consistent, we've done one thing to constrain the market we want to address, those specific high-end smartphone markets. We are taking steps to make sure we will never constrain it again.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Douglas Freedman (Analysts)】\nOkay. Moving on...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nAnd that includes that potential fab up in Oregon, just to complete that thought and tying with what you said. Yes, that plan of ours to address that longer term includes that facility, and that's a long-term plan because we don't expect that to -- once we get that going, if we get that going, that won't come into play -- come into line until more towards 2018. 2016 and '17, what we have in Fort Collins 8-inch conversion is pretty cool. '18, uncertainty. We better get this additional Oregon fab.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Douglas Freedman (Analysts)】\nI guess as my follow-up, what capacity addition does that Oregon fab enable, if you could, on a percentage? Does that kind of double your FBAR capacity going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nWe generally don't want to disclose that, Doug, sorry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Srini Pajjuri (Analysts)】\nHock, again, on wireless. I know you said you have visibility into the next 2 to 3 years on the design wins and also on the architectures. I'm just curious as to how much visibility you have on the pricing front because, obviously, to say that your content is increasing 20%, you got to assume some pricing curve. And the reason I'm asking is and given that your competitors are also adding capacity, what's the risk that your pricing assumptions could go wrong here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nOh, you're right. It's -- again, I'm approaching it from a very macro point of view and a very trend basis. And if you look at my trend and macro over the last 4 years, that 20% is what I've been achieving and have been able to achieve and achieving. And I think there's nothing really that we see out there, though I should never take it for granted because each one is an interesting challenge by itself. I'll be honest, the products we do in FBAR in front-end module, pets [ph], as I call them, are very, very difficult things to do. I mean, I'm not saying they are moon shots, but they're not that far from that. And we spend an enormous amount of money, talent doing it. So the best way to describe it is we don't see anything that dramatically changed, though each one is a tough one by itself. So as I've seen it the last 4 years, I'm basically commenting that it sure looks that for the next 2, 3 years, we'll see a continuation of this trend. And we see that, as I answer in an earlier question, through more bands, through the increasing issue of coexistence across bands in handsets, plus just as much the phenomenon of downlink and uplink carrier aggregation as operators need to run their network and base station much more efficiently. And all that is happening. It's not pie in the sky.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Srini Pajjuri (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then, Tony, on the balance sheet side, I guess once you close the Broadcom deal, I think you told us you're going to have the leverage ratio around 2.5x or so. My question is, if an opportunity comes along to do additional M&A next year or some other time, first, what's your strategy in terms of additional M&A here? And then how much debt capacity you think you have?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony Maslowski (Executives)】\nYes, so taken in reverse order, we definitely have the debt capacity to go probably back to 3x or slightly above it. So you can think about, at any given time, we can be another turn here right out of the gate. However, the Broadcom acquisition, there will be a digestion phase for Broadcom. And as we've said, we don't wake up every morning looking for the next acquisition. We're very opportunistic on the acquisition front, and we'll look at it as we go. But again, I think we have flexibility with a starting point at 2.5x to do what we need to do, and if something opportunistic comes along, we'll take advantage of that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Amit Daryanani (Analysts)】\nQuestion from me. I guess, if I go back to the wireless segment, Hock, this should have been [ph] talked about. When you add capacity in the near term over the next 12 months, call it, are you doing it based on the design wins you have? Or do you have much more formed purchase commitments from your larger OEMs and hence, you're adding capacity?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nIt's a judgmental process, and that judgment tends to be very tied to -- slant, bias conservatively. But you're right, it's tied to sockets, I believe in sockets that we will win over the next 12, 18 months. And you're right, sometimes we have to scramble to put capacity in place because of that kind of approach, but we believe that we prefer to be conservative than the other way around. But at the end of it all, it's all based on judgment, and we tend to be rather conservative in lagging capacity build-out behind what we see as demand. We might have, based on an earlier statement, started to behave a little differently. But basically, we are very conservative creatures is what we know we are. But it's all based on judgment and obviously, our judgment is that we will use up the capacity that we're putting in place for the next 2, 3 years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Amit Daryanani (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then on the enterprise side, you talked about share gains and demonstrating [ph] better. I'm curious. Is that more on the HDD side? Or is that more the fiber channel adapters from Emulex where you think you might be picking up more share?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nI think it's more on the connectivity side than the HDD side. HDD market doesn't change very much.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Harlan Sur (Analysts)】\nOn the wireless business, typically calendar Q1 is when your large Asian smartphone customer ramps production of its flagship platform. So the question is, are you seeing some of this ramp in your fiscal Q1, or is that typically seen in fiscal Q2? And then, Hock, in line with your commentary, are you anticipating 20% plus content gains on their new flagship smartphones?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nI would say yes to all 3, yes. There is an uptick there, late Q1, probably Q2 fiscal, not calendar, fiscal Q2, more like fiscal Q2. And yes, we do see improvement in content.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Harlan Sur (Analysts)】\nThat's great. And then industrial, you had anticipated revenues to be down kind of low single digits in Q4. It came down 10% sequentially, but I think it's obviously a good decision to be prudent and take down inventories in the fourth quarter. As you think about Q1 and another quarter of inventory reduction, can you just help us understand your expectations for sell-through? And also, any commentary on demand by geography that you would expect in Q1?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nYes, good point. Keep in mind, maybe first, simplest way to answer is our Q1 is November, December and January. So as you know -- as you probably know, industrial seasonality is down late -- end of the year and up again beginning of the year. So for Q1, we only have 1 month, not much. So that's why we continue to be -- to forecast and be conservative in our guidance of industrial revenue, whether they be resale or shipping. On the resale front, yes, we kind of see industrial -- it's hard to break out between seasonality versus secular in this case. All we see is that industrial is kind of struggling even to stay flat at this point. We saw -- our Q4, just to emphasize, was actually August, September, October. So we only saw part of the downturn of the back end of the year. And so that -- so even though our shipping was down, our resale, as I indicated, wasn't that bad. So I would expect our resale Q1 to be not so good, and that's why I used the word struggle to even stay flat, which is why we believe we better guide our shipping, which is our revenue, at down single digits. And we could have -- and not more or less, let's put it that way, because if the resale maybe down even more but our shipping is less because we already pulled down inventory last quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Snyder (Analysts)】\nHock, you said 8-inch will probably take you through the transition in about 2017. The Hynix fab in Portland probably wouldn't get turned on, I think you indicated till, what, 2018. It seems kind of to be the flat spot between the 2. I was just curious, the silicon SAW stuff that you've been working on, is that there to take up the slack, to take some of the pressure off your BAW fab by moving some of the lower-end stuff into that? Or is that more of a push by Avago to expand your filter offering beyond just traditional BAW into something maybe that would be more competitive in the SAW front? And I have a follow-up, please.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nNo, I think we -- we think we have planned it pretty well because you're right, 8 inch will take us all the way through product generation of '17, which will just be in time for the fab up in Oregon to come in for '18. So it's straight on, and it's all largely focused on filters, all the sense [ph].\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Snyder (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then the 20% increase, I know it's more of a general number for the TAM growth over all, but it sounds like you're pretty enthusiastic about that for the next year. In 2015 [ph], as it specifically applies to Avago, will more of that come from, say, the max [ph] filters? And is that really a content gain like you're getting more parts? Or is it more of an ASP boost given how tough these are to do? Maybe not more die size itself, but you're just getting paid better for it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hock Tan (Executives)】\nNo, we're very nice people to our customers. We basically -- it'd be more content and we actually give a discount on a per filter basis. It's a lot more content, a lot more filters.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ashish Saran (Executives)】\nThank you, operator. Thank you for participating in today's earnings call.

      "transcript_text1": "Okay. Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. I will briefly go with a few highlights before turning it over to Michael. \r\nIn the third quarter, total sales increased by 13%. This increase reflects the expansion of our store network but is also driven by strong organic growth. This quarter, we achieved a 6.4% increase in same-store sales within higher average basket size and an increase in the number of transactions. Our EBITDA grew by 34.8%. It is important to note that higher gross margins played a big role in this exceptional growth. In fiscal 2016, we have been actively managing our margins to offset the impact of the weakening Canadian dollar on the cost of domestic and imported products paid for in U.S. dollars. So far, in fiscal 2016, our currency hedges continue to favorably impact our margins. However, there is a significant timing element here. And therefore, we expect gross margin to revert back to historical levels within the range of 36% to 37% in fiscal 2017. Finally, net income for the quarter was $101.1 million, representing a 37.1% increase in year-over-year. \r\nLooking at our store network. Dollarama has now surpassed the 1,000-store mark. We opened 16 net new stores this quarter compared to 11 in Q3 of last year. This brings our total store count to 1,005 compared to 928 in November 2, 2014. We have opened 15 net new stores since the beginning of the fiscal year, and for the full year, we still expect to open between 70 and 80 stores. As a result, the fourth quarter will be a busy one in this regard. From a merchandising point of view, Halloween sales were very strong, and customers responded well to our offering. The fact that Halloween fell on a Saturday further stimulated sales in this quarter.\r\nOur stores transitioned quickly from one season to the other, and we are now focused on the historically busy holiday season. Last year, in Q4, we reported exceptional same-store sales of 8.5% in part because we were comparing ourselves to the fiscal 2014 holiday season when we experienced unusually adverse weather conditions as you probably all remember. In terms of year-over-year growth percentage, this obviously sets the bar quite high for this year. \r\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Michael.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. As Larry mentioned, total sales increased during the quarter by 13% to $664.5 million from $588 million in the prior year. The increase in sales was fueled by the opening of 77 net new stores over the past 12 months and a same-store sales increase year-over-year of 6.4%. Same-store sales growth consisted of a 5.4% increase in base basket size, which reflects consumer demand for the higher price point items and a 0.9 increase in the number of transactions driven by higher traffic. In this quarter, 59.7% of our sales were from products priced higher than $1.25 compared to $54.1 in the corresponding quarter last year. Effective this quarter, we will be reporting this metric using the [indiscernible] price point as a reference instead of the $1 price point. We believe this will provide a better appreciation for the fact that there are still many items offered in our stores at very affordable price points at or below $1.25. With the majority of units sold in our stores being at the $1.25 price point or below, we believe this is a better reflection of the extreme value end of our price point range and so a better point of comparison when looking at the penetration of higher price points. \r\nAnd the third quarter of our gross margin was 40% of sales compared to 36.8% of sales in Q3 last year. As we explained in September, our highest -- our higher-than-expected gross margin for the quarter and year-to-date has been driven by higher product margin in anticipation of an increase in our average forward contract rate. In other words, we may select changes to our product offering and price mix while we were still hedged at favorable rates in anticipation of next year's currency headwind when those hedges are scheduled to roll out. The higher gross margin is also attributable to lower transportation costs as a percentage of sales, as a result of operational improvements as well as rate and fuel surcharge reductions. Margin is also benefiting from the positive scaling impact of stronger-than-anticipated sales.\r\nBased on third quarter results, we have adjusted [ph] our fiscal 2016 gross margin target range upward from the range of 37% to 38% disclosed in September 2015 concurrently with our Q2 results to a range of 38% to 39% for the full year. We believe that while comparable store sales growth for the first 9 months of fiscal 2016 is exceptionally strong, the trend for fiscal 2017 should revert back to historical results, which are more in range of 4% to 5% combined -- total. Gross margin should also come back down within the range of 36% to 37%. As we've done in the past, we will continue to actively manage the gross margin by reinvesting in our value proposition by refreshing up to 25% to 30% of our product offering on a yearly basis. Longer term, the goal is to maintain a margin that will sustain reasonable profitability while ensuring that our customers are getting value to stimulate sales.\r\nOur Q3 SG&A was 16.7% of sales compared to 17.2% last year. This progression is the result of our in-store labor productivity improvements and the positive scaling effect of higher sales on fixed costs. Overall, we expect an improvement in the SG&A margin for the full fiscal year 2016 and continue to target a margin between 16.5% to 17% for fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2017, the targeted range will be between 16% and 16.5%. With higher sales and margins and lower G&A costs, EBITDA in Q3 grew 34.8% to $154.8 million or 23.3% of sales.\r\nQ3 net earnings increased to $100.1 million or $0.78 per diluted share compared to $73 million or $0.55 per diluted shares in the third quarter last year. Cash flows from operation increased to $114.4 million in Q3 from $62.8 million for the same period last year. This increase is due to the higher earnings. We spent $21.2 million on CapEx in Q3 compared to $18.5 million last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect to incur total CapEx in the range of $95 to $100 million -- $95 million to $100 million depending on the number of new stores that opened in Q4.\r\nAt this point, we are forecasting CapEx of $100 million to $110 million for fiscal 2017. As in fiscal 2016, these will mostly be related to new stores, fixtures, equipment as well as information technology projects. \r\nGetting to -- getting into our capital structure now. In October 2015, we entered into an amending agreement with our lenders and extended the term of our credit agreement by one year from December 2019 to December 2020. We received additional commitments of $125 million, which is over and above the $250 million credit already available under the revolving facility, for a period of approximately 20 months to June 2017 pursuant to the accordion feature of the credit agreement. This period coincides with the maturity date of the floating rate notes. We are planning to use this extra capacity on the revolver to further optimize Dollarama's capital structure between now and June 2017, including too the purchase of shares under our share buyback program.\r\nIn Q3, we repurchased a total of 2.1 million shares at an average weighted cost of $88.83 per share for a total cash consideration of $188.2 million for cancellation under our 2015 and '16 share buyback program. Today, we received approval from the TSX to amend the 2015, 2016 NCIB to increase the maximum number of shares that may be repurchased from approximately 4.5 million common shares or 3.5% of the common shares issued in outstanding as of the close of markets on June 9, 2015, to approximately 6.4 million common shares or 5% of the common shares issued in outstanding on the reference date. The other terms of the NCIB program remain unchanged.\r\nNow from an operational perspective, we have made significant investment in stores over the past few years and we are seeing, again, the results in the steady improvement of our SG&A margin. This year, we completed the rollout of WiFi in all our stores. The introduction of WiFi lays the foundation for the use of mobile technology in our stores, and some of these mobile-driven projects are currently being piloted in select stores. These initiatives are intended to reduce nonvalue-added tasks at the store level, manual tasks, optimize inventory levels in the store and reduce wait time at the checkout. We expect to start seeing the benefits of these new operational efficiency towards the end of fiscal 2017.\r\nDebit card penetration continues to increase year-over-year as 46.6% of sales were paid with debit cards compared to 43.8% in the corresponding period of previous fiscal year. In November 2015, we activated tap and go in all of our stores so that consumers can benefit from the flexibility of contactless technology for purchases. It also saves time at checkout, which can only have positive impact on waiting times and lineups at the cash. \r\nRegarding payment methods, we will start accepting credit cards on a trial basis in our 80-plus stores in British Columbia beginning in early 2016. We have been evaluating credit cards as a payment method since -- before our IPO, and we believe the timing is right to run another pilot at this time. Since the last time we ran a pilot, which was back in 2010, things have changed quite a bit. Customers are increasingly using noncash payment options, especially younger customers, while most exclusively use plastic as a payment method. In addition, we operate more stores and our average basket size is higher. \r\nConducting the pilot in British Columbia allows us to test a good sized sample of stores that are representative of the average basket size and mix of payment methods across the chain. No time line has been set as to the length of the pilot. As an example the last time we did a pilot of this nature in 2010, a decision was made after a 12-month period. The pilot will tell us if customers are receptive and if there is meaningful incremental improvements in our sales. In summary, we are doing a thorough credit card pilot only in British Columbia, only starting next year.\r\nFinally, as a natural evolution of Dollarama's growth strategy, we will be gradually introducing $3.50 and $4 price points in the second half of fiscal 2017. We are maintaining by design our product mix, focusing on increasing the sales in the key categories that have made us a unique value destination, namely seasonal and general merchandising products. Selectively introducing $3.50 and $4 will enable us to enhance our customer shopping experience. We have not set a particular target to reach a critical mass of items at these price points and we do not expect them to have a significant impact on our overall offering in fiscal 2017.\r\nIn closing, we are obviously very pleased with the financial and operating performance of the company this quarter and the continued progress being made on our key initiatives. \r\nSo this ends our formal remarks, and we can now take questions. Operator, I'll turn the call over to you.",

In terms of year-over-year growth percentage, this obviously sets the bar quite high for this year. \r\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Michael.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nThank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. As Larry mentioned, total sales increased during the quarter by 13% to $664.5 million from $588 million in the prior year. The increase in sales was fueled by the opening of 77 net new stores over the past 12 months and a same-store sales increase year-over-year of 6.4%. Same-store sales growth consisted of a 5.4% increase in base basket size, which reflects consumer demand for the higher price point items and a 0.9 increase in the number of transactions driven by higher traffic. In this quarter, 59.7% of our sales were from products priced higher than $1.25 compared to $54.1 in the corresponding quarter last year. Effective this quarter, we will be reporting this metric using the [indiscernible] price point as a reference instead of the $1 price point. We believe this will provide a better appreciation for the fact that there are still many items offered in our stores at very affordable price points at or below $1.25. With the majority of units sold in our stores being at the $1.25 price point or below, we believe this is a better reflection of the extreme value end of our price point range and so a better point of comparison when looking at the penetration of higher price points. \r\nAnd the third quarter of our gross margin was 40% of sales compared to 36.8% of sales in Q3 last year. As we explained in September, our highest -- our higher-than-expected gross margin for the quarter and year-to-date has been driven by higher product margin in anticipation of an increase in our average forward contract rate. In other words, we may select changes to our product offering and price mix while we were still hedged at favorable rates in anticipation of next year's currency headwind when those hedges are scheduled to roll out. The higher gross margin is also attributable to lower transportation costs as a percentage of sales, as a result of operational improvements as well as rate and fuel surcharge reductions. Margin is also benefiting from the positive scaling impact of stronger-than-anticipated sales.\r\nBased on third quarter results, we have adjusted [ph] our fiscal 2016 gross margin target range upward from the range of 37% to 38% disclosed in September 2015 concurrently with our Q2 results to a range of 38% to 39% for the full year. We believe that while comparable store sales growth for the first 9 months of fiscal 2016 is exceptionally strong, the trend for fiscal 2017 should revert back to historical results, which are more in range of 4% to 5% combined -- total. Gross margin should also come back down within the range of 36% to 37%. As we've done in the past, we will continue to actively manage the gross margin by reinvesting in our value proposition by refreshing up to 25% to 30% of our product offering on a yearly basis. Longer term, the goal is to maintain a margin that will sustain reasonable profitability while ensuring that our customers are getting value to stimulate sales.\r\nOur Q3 SG&A was 16.7% of sales compared to 17.2% last year. This progression is the result of our in-store labor productivity improvements and the positive scaling effect of higher sales on fixed costs. Overall, we expect an improvement in the SG&A margin for the full fiscal year 2016 and continue to target a margin between 16.5% to 17% for fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2017, the targeted range will be between 16% and 16.5%. With higher sales and margins and lower G&A costs, EBITDA in Q3 grew 34.8% to $154.8 million or 23.3% of sales.\r\nQ3 net earnings increased to $100.1 million or $0.78 per diluted share compared to $73 million or $0.55 per diluted shares in the third quarter last year. Cash flows from operation increased to $114.4 million in Q3 from $62.8 million for the same period last year. This increase is due to the higher earnings. We spent $21.2 million on CapEx in Q3 compared to $18.5 million last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect to incur total CapEx in the range of $95 to $100 million -- $95 million to $100 million depending on the number of new stores that opened in Q4.\r\nAt this point, we are forecasting CapEx of $100 million to $110 million for fiscal 2017. As in fiscal 2016, these will mostly be related to new stores, fixtures, equipment as well as information technology projects. \r\nGetting to -- getting into our capital structure now. In October 2015, we entered into an amending agreement with our lenders and extended the term of our credit agreement by one year from December 2019 to December 2020. We received additional commitments of $125 million, which is over and above the $250 million credit already available under the revolving facility, for a period of approximately 20 months to June 2017 pursuant to the accordion feature of the credit agreement. This period coincides with the maturity date of the floating rate notes. We are planning to use this extra capacity on the revolver to further optimize Dollarama's capital structure between now and June 2017, including too the purchase of shares under our share buyback program.\r\nIn Q3, we repurchased a total of 2.1 million shares at an average weighted cost of $88.83 per share for a total cash consideration of $188.2 million for cancellation under our 2015 and '16 share buyback program. Today, we received approval from the TSX to amend the 2015, 2016 NCIB to increase the maximum number of shares that may be repurchased from approximately 4.5 million common shares or 3.5% of the common shares issued in outstanding as of the close of markets on June 9, 2015, to approximately 6.4 million common shares or 5% of the common shares issued in outstanding on the reference date. The other terms of the NCIB program remain unchanged.\r\nNow from an operational perspective, we have made significant investment in stores over the past few years and we are seeing, again, the results in the steady improvement of our SG&A margin. This year, we completed the rollout of WiFi in all our stores. The introduction of WiFi lays the foundation for the use of mobile technology in our stores, and some of these mobile-driven projects are currently being piloted in select stores. These initiatives are intended to reduce nonvalue-added tasks at the store level, manual tasks, optimize inventory levels in the store and reduce wait time at the checkout. We expect to start seeing the benefits of these new operational efficiency towards the end of fiscal 2017.\r\nDebit card penetration continues to increase year-over-year as 46.6% of sales were paid with debit cards compared to 43.8% in the corresponding period of previous fiscal year. In November 2015, we activated tap and go in all of our stores so that consumers can benefit from the flexibility of contactless technology for purchases. It also saves time at checkout, which can only have positive impact on waiting times and lineups at the cash. \r\nRegarding payment methods, we will start accepting credit cards on a trial basis in our 80-plus stores in British Columbia beginning in early 2016. We have been evaluating credit cards as a payment method since -- before our IPO, and we believe the timing is right to run another pilot at this time. Since the last time we ran a pilot, which was back in 2010, things have changed quite a bit. Customers are increasingly using noncash payment options, especially younger customers, while most exclusively use plastic as a payment method. In addition, we operate more stores and our average basket size is higher. \r\nConducting the pilot in British Columbia allows us to test a good sized sample of stores that are representative of the average basket size and mix of payment methods across the chain. No time line has been set as to the length of the pilot. As an example the last time we did a pilot of this nature in 2010, a decision was made after a 12-month period. The pilot will tell us if customers are receptive and if there is meaningful incremental improvements in our sales. In summary, we are doing a thorough credit card pilot only in British Columbia, only starting next year.\r\nFinally, as a natural evolution of Dollarama's growth strategy, we will be gradually introducing $3.50 and $4 price points in the second half of fiscal 2017. We are maintaining by design our product mix, focusing on increasing the sales in the key categories that have made us a unique value destination, namely seasonal and general merchandising products. Selectively introducing $3.50 and $4 will enable us to enhance our customer shopping experience. We have not set a particular target to reach a critical mass of items at these price points and we do not expect them to have a significant impact on our overall offering in fiscal 2017.\r\nIn closing, we are obviously very pleased with the financial and operating performance of the company this quarter and the continued progress being made on our key initiatives. \r\nSo this ends our formal remarks, and we can now take questions. Operator, I'll turn the call over to you.",
      "transcript_text3": "In the outlook, the store opening range of 60 to 70 is a little lower than I think what you're targeting for this year. What are some of the dynamics that are causing you to keep that number a little more modest?\n\n---\n\nBecause I'm modest. Perry, Larry. It's hard for me to be bullish on anything actually, particularly store numbers. So I put down what I feel we can attain and modestly attain, if we can use that word again, and I guess I feel that the runway is becoming tighter at the 10,000 square foot module that we presently have. It may or may not. I'm always surprising myself on that particular issue, so this may continue to be surprising to me and delightful in many ways. So at the end of the day, I'm -- I feel I'm being modest -- what did we have for next year?\n\n---\n\n60 to 70.\n\n---\n\nYes, that is modest. So let's take it like that. Let's leave it like that for now because I just don't know -- certainly, I can say for next year, that seems modest. The years to follow, since I don't have a good handle on that, I'm being conservative.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then in considering your outlook for the SG&A margins, what factors are you concerned about managing on the expense side for next year? Is it minimum wage? Or are there other issues that might hold back a little more leverage on the SG&A?\n\n---\n\nNo. We're very comfortable in managing for solid gross margin, as we've always done. The key factor here for next year is clearly the currency. So it's -- we're rolling out, getting closer to -- and closer to the spot rates that we've seen recently, so it's just that. The other factors, there's no material movement.\n\n---\n\nI was actually thinking a little bit more about the cost side of the business, the SG&A side of the business, Michael.\n\n---\n\nSo -- okay. You're talking about the SG&A?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nYes -- no. G&A, it's a normal headwind from wage increases and continued savings from our productivity initiatives. So that's why we're comfortable with the range that we stated. In other words, an improvement over this year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just the last question, the additional higher price points, did they allow you to get into some new categories or new items that you've otherwise been shut out of?\n\n---\n\nLarry here. Certainly not new categories. New items, well, I said that we'd have a better -- more clarity after we came back from our China trip in October, and we came back without much more clarity because when we tackle the weak Canadian dollar and factor everything in, we didn't come back with too much in that -- from that perspective. So I don't expect there to be that many items in those price points at all. There will be some, but whether they will blow the roof apart with those items, in other words, whether we think they're exceptional value, first of all, the buyers have got to get used to buying goods at those price points, factoring the exchange rate and then saying, \"Hey, is that great value or not?\" And that didn't happen very often during our October trip as I checked with all of the buyers. So I don't expect that to have a significant -- not next year anyway. Maybe in the future, I don't know, as we become more familiar with those price points and we handle the Canadian FX problems. Apparently, I'm more expected to have poorer -- the Canadian dollar is supposed to get even poorer than it is today. So all of that factors into the values we can offer at $3.50 and $4, and hope that in the relative -- from a relative of point of view that they're good value. But we, as buyers, and not only we, as buyers, our customers also have to be able to absorb these 2 new price points. So it's going to be a very slow rollout, if -- really slow, in my opinion, and I don't expect it to have any major impact on very much.\n\n---\n\nI noticed you gave on the call some initial guidance for same-store sales growth. I believe you said 4% to 5%, which would be a deceleration from current levels. So I'm just wondering what's underlying that. Does that reflect some of the comments that Larry just made on the higher -- the new higher price points you're introducing? Or are there other factors at play? Or you're just up against roncon [ph].\n\n---\n\nNo. Simply, Peter, it's -- right now for the first 9 months, we're at 7.1% SSS, which is quite high for a 9-month period. So I think it's just reasonable to expect that we're going to be comping against a very strong year and that to expect another 6%, 7% next year would be very exceptional. So it's simply bringing it back into a reasonable range.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And Michael, on another matter, can you be more definitive on the timing on when the foreign -- these favorably priced foreign exchange hedges roll off and when you really begin to reset in the context of current exchange rates?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think as I gave a bit of color last quarter, it's this year, Q3 and Q4, we continue to see some favorable impact. But beginning of next year, Q1, you'll -- we'll start seeing some impact and then continuing through the year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And finally, I just wanted to ask you and Larry, you want to work back to that 36%, 37% gross margin in terms of the value proposition. I just wanted to ask what's -- like what's the magic in the 36%, 37%? I mean, why not 30%, why not 40%? Where does that number come from?\n\n---\n\nCan you imagine if we told you 30%? Having said that, I don't think there's a magic. I think basically, we're not -- it's not a set amount. We're just trying to be realistic and say that what's just happened is not realistic, and what's more realistic is what historically we've been doing between 36% and 37%. If he came to me and said we're going to go for 40%, he'd probably lose his job, so he didn't have the nerve to do that. And if he came at 30%, well, you guys would be all over us. So we're basically go -- using the 36%, 37% as the historical numbers that we feel comfortable with, and it may be hopefully better than that. It's very hard to manage when your -- when the foreign exchange is having its ups and downs at this rate, and because I mean it's just quite exceptional.\n\n---\n\nYes. And historically, we're able to maintain some good sales growth levels, same-store sales with the 36%, 37%. We just don't want to exaggerate, and we're -- the buyers obviously can't shop a lot at those levels. So as we said, 36% to 37% is -- remains our comfort level.\n\n---\n\nMichael, just with respect to your CapEx guide at the midpoint, fewer stores, higher CapEx guide, is there some inflection in terms of new store bulk cost? Or is that all the heavy IT-related commentary that you highlighted? And then if it is the IT-related side of it, could you perhaps give some indication on sort of where the focus areas are for you in terms of that elevated spend next year?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So you're good, Kenric. You filled the number of stores -- yes, by the way, it's just a bit lower. There's always the timing of new store openings and so on. But essentially, in terms of store openings, just to reassure everyone, the economics are still the same, i.e. to open up the store is still $400,000 or around that and $230,000 of inventory and 2-year payback. So that hasn't changed. And yes, it's the mix of the new transformation projects. Maintenance is more or less stable again. And so it's the transformation project, and that's where it varies.\n\n---\n\nAnd just on those projects, any additional color you could provide around those at this point?\n\n---\n\nNot really.\n\n---\n\nOkay, enough. Fair enough. One final one, just on the gross margin expansion in the quarter, you highlighted the impact of transportation costs, et cetera. Are you able to sort of better handicap how much of the gross margin expansion was transportation and the like? Or are you not inclined to share that with us?\n\n---\n\nNo. But as I mentioned on the last quarter, it's the -- you're talking about the -- majority of the impact on gross margin was FX adjustment-related. There's transportation cost, second; and scaling, third.\n\n---\n\nCan you just comment on the new price points? The margin contribution on those price points, is it similar to the 36% to 37% target you guys have?\n\n---\n\nYes. Initially, like we said in the past, usually when you introduce them, the percentage margin is a bit lower. You don't get the benefit of -- the quantities and so on. But over time, we try to improve on that margin. The dollar contribution is higher, but the percentage is not. It's usually a bit lower.\n\n---\n\nOkay, understood. And have you guys witnessed any impact from the slowdown in Western Canada and even in Alberta, Saskatchewan?\n\n---\n\nNo, still not. No real change at all. Every province is moving in sync with the chain as the prior year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just, finally, can you give us any update at all on the Dollar City? How many stores are you guys at down there now? And even just anecdotally, I mean, have you seen sales increase materially since you took over the procurement?\n\n---\n\nYes. So I won't disclose how many stores we're at because of some material and we want to respect our confidentiality agreement. But also say -- obviously, the results seem promising but, again, not material about this time.\n\n---\n\nI'm just wondering are you seeing any resistance to your higher prices? I mean, obviously, your consumers had to face much higher price points than they're used to. Is there any sense of a pushback from them?\n\n---\n\nWe -- I don't see or feel that. I look at our penetration of higher price points, it's steadily increasing and it has always been steadily increasing.\n\n---\n\nYes, if numbers count, I guess, we have to say no to your question.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And partly following on Kenric's question, but with respect to the buybacks, so am I wrong in assuming that you've increased the current NCIB because of being so far ahead on your sort of free cash flow forecast that you felt you had excess capacity utilized this year? And then as a follow-on to that, what would your thinking be for a renewal in June of 2016?\n\n---\n\nYes, well, I don't know for 20 -- June of 2016, but right now we're following it -- our buyback program closely, obviously. We've been active, as you've noticed, and we're still very much a growing company and continuing to do very well, and we just expect the opportunity to buy back more before next June, so that's why we increased it this quarter.\n\n---\n\nAnd any change to your thinking about your net debt to EBITDAR target? Like is it still 3x, generally speaking?\n\n---\n\nYes. It's in that range. It was increased to 325 recently by DBRS, the capacity to maintain the current -- our current rating. So DBRS recently increased it, but -- and always using 8 as a factor to capitalize operating leases when we're talking about 3 and 325. Otherwise, if you use 6 as a factor, it's 275x, but we're -- we would keep ourselves some wiggle room. Obviously, we do also the some share buybacks on an opportunistic basis as much as possible, obviously.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then my last question, just factor the new store growth outlook. Larry, I've kind of lost track of where we're at on trying to do smaller stores. I know at one time that was kind of the focus, and I think you were not necessarily wowed by the results. If we're seeing 10,000 square-foot box opportunities potentially get quite tight, does that reinvigorate your interest in smaller stores in trying to make those work?\n\n---\n\nI don't think I was negative to it. I said that as long as we have opportunities to keep finding 10,000 square-foot boxes, 10 or 10 to 15 even, we -- that would be our preference. I think it's harder to manage smaller store surfaces. I mean, whether they're -- they don't have to all -- go all the way down to 5. 5 is almost a different business, but they can go 9 to 8 to 7, even to 6, but that's getting pretty hard to manage. And if we have better management tools, so as time goes on, we can be more selective and possibly better manage 6, 7, 5 -- 5,000, 6,000 7,000, 8,000-foot stores. But ideally, it would be nice to continue to find offices and opportunities at 10,000 to 15,000 feet, if we can. And now when the time comes that we can't and we have these better management tools, we'll take a look at it, but we have opened 7,000-footers of late, 7,000 to 8,000 footers. And they usually have basements in them. So that gives us a little bit of help. And what we save on those 2,000, 3,000 feet, we usually put into labor because you're receiving into basements and then transporting merchandise on a daily basis up and down. To open a 5,000-footer with no basement is almost a different business and we'll look at them and those opportunities when we have to, but it's the same manager, it's the same labor, and I don't think we're far from being exhausted at the 10,000 to 15,000-foot box. I believe we still have a ways to go, but I'm certainly not negative to looking at it, not at all. Not at all.\n\n---\n\nHow are you finding rent? Is there pressure on rent?\n\n---\n\nNo. I think I would say stable, particularly out west, where things are a little rougher. But in renewals, we renew many leases at the same as we have. And when you're saying the same, that's a 10-year lease with a bump usually after 5 years within that 10 years. So we're usually being able to keep our rents, I would say, pretty constant, giving -- you're going to have some increases, you're going to have some sames and you're going to have a few with decreases. So generally speaking, and I think it's -- they're pretty similar. So no major, like I said a few years ago, that it was -- I don't think that exists any longer at the moment. Things change quickly, but they don't -- if you ask me the question today, so today, I would say not.\n\n---\n\nJust wondering about your guidance range and is there conditions there? I mean, you mentioned -- you called out the currency and you expect the Canadian dollar to be weaker perhaps, I guess, in your budgets going forward. I mean, what are the conditions that would take your margins higher than the ranges that you've provided other than currency? Do you see opportunity there? Or are you being kind of modest or conservative in your outlook?\n\n---\n\nWell, Dave, we've shown clearly over the past 2 years that we can manage the margin, and we've explained the -- and you see what happens when there's a sharp increase in the margin and that was the effect of that. Now we're managing it back to our comfort zone. So we will adjust whenever the currency does, and we've demonstrated that again. And what we're, I guess, telling you is that our comfort zone is not at the current level. It's -- so we want to keep that compellingness out there and reinvest into the products. So we're bringing down the margin to 36%, 37%.\n\n---\n\nYes, and I can add that I don't think there's an opportunity to go above -- well, 35%, 38%, 39% because I don't think we can give the compelling value, which is the key motivation to our existence here. The compelling value that we've been giving, if we try to push the margins higher, I think we should be happy at what they are. I've always said that -- I've always used the word vulgar actually, but I'll take it back just for our sakes. It's out there in the public now, but I would be very happy. I think when we went public, we were in the 34% to 35% area. And at that time, I was very happy, and with those results, today we're, well, exceptional. Let's say we're 37%, 38%, 39%, let's forget the 40% for a moment. So I have to be satisfied with that and I think everybody should be. We're still giving great value, and that is #1. Our SSSs reflect that. So to strive for more markup, I don't think would be the right thing to do.\n\n---\n\nWhat about on the SG&A as a percentage of sales? The ranges you've given, I think there's a lot of folks out there at the bottom end or lower than that in their projections. Is there conditions there that would take the number below that?\n\n---\n\nNo, the -- well, no. I mean, the numbers we gave you are the numbers that we are comfortable with. So...\n\n---\n\nAre there conditions? That would happen but I think you're...\n\n---\n\nYes, the likelihood of -- I mean, the best likelihood is between 16.5% and 17% for the year, this year.\n\n---\n\nAnd my final question, just on kind of price points and relative price points to, I guess, other retailers, other forms of competition out there. So you're moving to the $3.50 and $4 price points. You're giving kind of a muted expectations for the contribution certainly for next year. Can you take us beyond that into, say, 2018? I mean, we've seen in previous that you've slowly rolled out products that are of a higher price. We're very careful about how you manage the margins and customer expectations and maintaining value and a proposition, in general, of value to the consumer. Does it get tougher here? Are past the sort of tipping point? Because you seem -- your guidance around those products seem much more modest perhaps in tone than I think I've heard in the past from you, and maybe you can answer that.\n\n---\n\nYes. I'll let Neil give a little color to that question.\n\n---\n\nI think that in true Larry tradition, he's continuing to be modest. For sure because of the timing of those 2 new price points, the impact on next year will be less than it will be the year after. But I think that as the buyers continued to get used to the price points to find great values, there will be an impact, a positive impact both to our customer shopping experience and to the overall basket.\n\n---\n\nAnd if I can ask just one more following that, thanks, Neil. Just with regard to store size, the offering size, as you  move -- and maybe early for this, but as you move into higher price points, maybe bigger products, other things, do you see -- foresee a need where you have to increase your store size at all, look to Dollarama plus or something like that where you -- as you push forward in your evolution?\n\n---\n\nSo we have someone asking us about a Dollarama express and you're asking me about a Dollarama plus. Look, it's all rent-dependent. If I can get 15,000 feet at what I feel are good terms, we'll do that. Will that allow us to put the larger $4 articles in those stores? And larger by -- I mean, cube wise. And what will that mean? It's pretty tough to give you a little bit of insight into that. I think, basically, the extra space allows us to better merchandise our present assortment, and it'll evolve in time.\n\n---\n\nI've got a couple of follow-up questions on the guidance. Michael, with respect to the gross margin, the 200-basis-point increase in the target gross margin, relative to, say, you're historical norm, I'm wondering if you might be able to go into a little bit more detail as to what is attributable to the pricing increase relative to the hedges wearing off, what's attributable to the decline in transport costs and what's attributable to the scale, or at least address the pricing increase at a minimum?\n\n---\n\nWell, yes. I'm not going to go into details of pricing increase, but definitely, while we're refreshing 25% to 30% of our items, we take into account the currency. Because of the steep increase again, the -- instead of using the actual hedge rate that you will be paying the item initially, you're using the higher rate, which is the spot rate to determine what your price should be to long term meet your margin requirement. So we're -- the next time you refresh the same item, so that you don't have to mark it up 6 months later, you set the price accordingly. And obviously, the buyers comp shop and make sure that it's -- will be compelling at that price. So that's what has been going on. And so as you roll out from your hedges and you catch up to that spot rate, when you're refreshing those same items, the cost of the currency is higher and the margin shrinks back to the levels that we were used to, 36%, to 37%. Transport has been contributing also, the scaling impact too, but I think that with the assumptions and the outlook, the assumptions being 4% to 5% same-store sales next year and the gross margin and G&A range, it's been still ending up in the 20% EBITDA range, is still obviously very good.\n\n---\n\nNo, I understand the mechanics. I just -- is it fair to say with the appreciation or depreciation of the Canadian dollar being so rapid that the majority of that gross margin increase this year that is attributable to pricing?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nIn other words, the buyers were duped into pricing goods at $1.30 when in actuality, we had hedges of $1.10, $1.10, $1.10, $1.08, $1.12. So we priced at $1.30 and it worked out. It just made us work harder.\n\n---\n\nOn the new store count, then, when you mentioned that the run rate, it could be a little bit tighter in terms of the availability of 10,000-foot stores, does that at all impact your forecast new store or your total store count total? I think it's 1,400.\n\n---\n\nNo. That remains, and even -- I mean, last year, when we mentioned for the first time that we were setting that new objective at 1,400, which is clearly still the case, we said that for this year, we have 70 to 80 and that you should use 60 stores as an average, giving us a 6- to 7-year runway. So nothing has changed.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then the last question, more out of curiosity than anything else, why did you decide to use BC as your pilot market for your credit card?\n\n---\n\nYes, okay. So the reason being BC is a good -- has a good sized sample of stores. It's representative of the chain in terms of basket size, mix of payment methods. So it's a more or less the same as the chain, and we wanted -- we were targeting a specific market, which would help avoid confusion at other store levels. So we're using a province, a total province, which is BC. And so what we're looking for is to improve the shopping experience of our customers while stimulating more sales to offset the cost.\n\n---\n\nIs -- would it be taken with the fact that a major competitor is -- has a bigger presence in that region? Will that have anything to do with it or no?\n\n---\n\nNo, no.\n\n---\n\nDidn't think of that. You just brought it up and just thought of it just now. You -- because you brought it up. And also when we threw the coin up in the air, it landed on BC. So there was not much other than we felt that going to one of the extremities of the country would be easier to handle in case this pilot failed and gave us the same results, but I think we have better metrics to measure success today than we did in 2010. And I'm a little bit more confident that in 2010, I was not confident that, that would work but I'm a little bit more confident today that it may work.\n\n---\n\nAnd you're right, Larry. And it's a good opportunity to test that market as it stands today and under more favorable terms also.\n\n---\n\nJust some questions on SG&A expense rate. Can you roughly break it down between variable expense versus fixed expense?\n\n---\n\nIt's still in the 85%, 15% range. 85% being variable, 15% fixed.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just in terms of the gross margin rate, you don't tend to put many or I think you have a policy not to put too many higher price points in the consumables area. And so I'm wondering if there's a natural shift of gross margin higher as you -- given that some -- I presume sales of general merchandise and seasonal grow faster as you shift this product mix or product price points or maybe not?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think at this point, I could say that we've made the point in the past that we're trying to stick and we've succeeded in doing so and we -- those are our full intentions on grocery items not to go over the $2 price point. So yes, your perception is correct. So on consumables, mainly grocery items. I'm not sure about the other consumers. Neil, are you trying to stick to any? No. So on consumables, foodstuffs, we're trying to stay at the $2 price point at maximum. And on the rest, well, the rest is the rest. So again, unless I've answered your question, I don't think I have anything else to say.\n\n---\n\nSo will there be a gradual shift, upward movement in gross margin given that consumables tend to be a lower gross margin category and you're not really adding higher price points or...?\n\n---\n\nWell, we're losing margin trying to keep staying at $2, by the way. On foodstuffs basically, grocery items, we don't concentrate on that area, but we're certainly losing gross margin by not being able to go over $2, so I don't expect that to add to gross margins. We're not expanding the range, but basically with the rest of the nonfood items, we'll continue to provide value where we can, I guess. Again, I'm not sure if I've answered your question.\n\n---\n\nAnd when we say that we're losing margin on the food because of the limited price point, that is until the buyer has time to adjust to the challenges of foreign exchange. Eventually, we're still working back to it as targeted margin within that price range.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just in terms of credit cards and debit cards, do you get any information at all on an anonymous basis on debit cards? Like can you track some debit card number, how much they shop or how they shop?\n\n---\n\nNo, not at all. We don't have access to any customer information.\n\n---\n\nAnd does that change with credit card or not really?\n\n---\n\nNo. It's the same system. All our systems are credit-card-enable, tap and go, everything. So it's just turning on the switch, very simple, no -- everything is there and yes, that's pretty simple.\n\n---\n\nAnd just on the technology, will you be doing any pilots this holiday period on the WiFi-enabled alternative cash, alternative payment lines, et cetera?\n\n---\n\nYes. There are some going on in certain stores, but the benefits from this, you'll start seeing more next year. This year, it's not material yet.\n\n---\n\nAnd the tap and go is next year also or now or...?\n\n---\n\nNo. It's already in place. It has been in place for a month or so.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, you better get it at Scarborough Town Center, I can tell you.\n\n---\n\nNo -- okay.\n\n---\n\nNo, just -- and just on the talk about the physical space and the number of stores, is the issue of number of stores not really related to what landlords have available but to where you want to put a store or where competitors are located or...?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think it's not an issue of where competitors are located really. I mean, if I could have my choice, I'd be next to the draw, but we kind of go anywhere it's available. And sometimes they'll do things to make sure that we get in. I mean, landlords consider us more favorably than they did 15 years ago. That's a good thing. It doesn't guarantee pricing, but it's a good thing that they want us as opposed to not want us. And I, again, I think I've answered your question.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then just finally on your initiative in Central and South America, are you at the point where you might want to look at one of the other countries within the agreement with your partner?\n\n---\n\nWell, we have a possibility of 9, but I'm not -- as I mentioned earlier, I don't want to disclose more than I need to because of the confidentiality agreement, but you're aware of the countries. We've mentioned those in the past, Central American countries, and so we're -- and we mentioned to you that we were looking at Colombia, but that's as far as we need to go.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nIn the outlook, the store opening range of 60 to 70 is a little lower than I think what you're targeting for this year. What are some of the dynamics that are causing you to keep that number a little more modest?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nBecause I'm modest. Perry, Larry. It's hard for me to be bullish on anything actually, particularly store numbers. So I put down what I feel we can attain and modestly attain, if we can use that word again, and I guess I feel that the runway is becoming tighter at the 10,000 square foot module that we presently have. It may or may not. I'm always surprising myself on that particular issue, so this may continue to be surprising to me and delightful in many ways. So at the end of the day, I'm -- I feel I'm being modest -- what did we have for next year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\n60 to 70.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, that is modest. So let's take it like that. Let's leave it like that for now because I just don't know -- certainly, I can say for next year, that seems modest. The years to follow, since I don't have a good handle on that, I'm being conservative.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then in considering your outlook for the SG&A margins, what factors are you concerned about managing on the expense side for next year? Is it minimum wage? Or are there other issues that might hold back a little more leverage on the SG&A?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo. We're very comfortable in managing for solid gross margin, as we've always done. The key factor here for next year is clearly the currency. So it's -- we're rolling out, getting closer to -- and closer to the spot rates that we've seen recently, so it's just that. The other factors, there's no material movement.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nI was actually thinking a little bit more about the cost side of the business, the SG&A side of the business, Michael.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nSo -- okay. You're talking about the SG&A?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes -- no. G&A, it's a normal headwind from wage increases and continued savings from our productivity initiatives. So that's why we're comfortable with the range that we stated. In other words, an improvement over this year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just the last question, the additional higher price points, did they allow you to get into some new categories or new items that you've otherwise been shut out of?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nLarry here. Certainly not new categories. New items, well, I said that we'd have a better -- more clarity after we came back from our China trip in October, and we came back without much more clarity because when we tackle the weak Canadian dollar and factor everything in, we didn't come back with too much in that -- from that perspective. So I don't expect there to be that many items in those price points at all. There will be some, but whether they will blow the roof apart with those items, in other words, whether we think they're exceptional value, first of all, the buyers have got to get used to buying goods at those price points, factoring the exchange rate and then saying, \"Hey, is that great value or not?\" And that didn't happen very often during our October trip as I checked with all of the buyers. So I don't expect that to have a significant -- not next year anyway. Maybe in the future, I don't know, as we become more familiar with those price points and we handle the Canadian FX problems. Apparently, I'm more expected to have poorer -- the Canadian dollar is supposed to get even poorer than it is today. So all of that factors into the values we can offer at $3.50 and $4, and hope that in the relative -- from a relative of point of view that they're good value. But we, as buyers, and not only we, as buyers, our customers also have to be able to absorb these 2 new price points. So it's going to be a very slow rollout, if -- really slow, in my opinion, and I don't expect it to have any major impact on very much.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Sklar (Analysts)】\nI noticed you gave on the call some initial guidance for same-store sales growth. I believe you said 4% to 5%, which would be a deceleration from current levels. So I'm just wondering what's underlying that. Does that reflect some of the comments that Larry just made on the higher -- the new higher price points you're introducing? Or are there other factors at play? Or you're just up against roncon [ph].\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo. Simply, Peter, it's -- right now for the first 9 months, we're at 7.1% SSS, which is quite high for a 9-month period. So I think it's just reasonable to expect that we're going to be comping against a very strong year and that to expect another 6%, 7% next year would be very exceptional. So it's simply bringing it back into a reasonable range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Sklar (Analysts)】\nOkay. And Michael, on another matter, can you be more definitive on the timing on when the foreign -- these favorably priced foreign exchange hedges roll off and when you really begin to reset in the context of current exchange rates?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. I think as I gave a bit of color last quarter, it's this year, Q3 and Q4, we continue to see some favorable impact. But beginning of next year, Q1, you'll -- we'll start seeing some impact and then continuing through the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Sklar (Analysts)】\nOkay. And finally, I just wanted to ask you and Larry, you want to work back to that 36%, 37% gross margin in terms of the value proposition. I just wanted to ask what's -- like what's the magic in the 36%, 37%? I mean, why not 30%, why not 40%? Where does that number come from?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nCan you imagine if we told you 30%? Having said that, I don't think there's a magic. I think basically, we're not -- it's not a set amount. We're just trying to be realistic and say that what's just happened is not realistic, and what's more realistic is what historically we've been doing between 36% and 37%. If he came to me and said we're going to go for 40%, he'd probably lose his job, so he didn't have the nerve to do that. And if he came at 30%, well, you guys would be all over us. So we're basically go -- using the 36%, 37% as the historical numbers that we feel comfortable with, and it may be hopefully better than that. It's very hard to manage when your -- when the foreign exchange is having its ups and downs at this rate, and because I mean it's just quite exceptional.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. And historically, we're able to maintain some good sales growth levels, same-store sales with the 36%, 37%. We just don't want to exaggerate, and we're -- the buyers obviously can't shop a lot at those levels. So as we said, 36% to 37% is -- remains our comfort level.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenric Tyghe (Analysts)】\nMichael, just with respect to your CapEx guide at the midpoint, fewer stores, higher CapEx guide, is there some inflection in terms of new store bulk cost? Or is that all the heavy IT-related commentary that you highlighted? And then if it is the IT-related side of it, could you perhaps give some indication on sort of where the focus areas are for you in terms of that elevated spend next year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nOkay. So you're good, Kenric. You filled the number of stores -- yes, by the way, it's just a bit lower. There's always the timing of new store openings and so on. But essentially, in terms of store openings, just to reassure everyone, the economics are still the same, i.e. to open up the store is still $400,000 or around that and $230,000 of inventory and 2-year payback. So that hasn't changed. And yes, it's the mix of the new transformation projects. Maintenance is more or less stable again. And so it's the transformation project, and that's where it varies.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenric Tyghe (Analysts)】\nAnd just on those projects, any additional color you could provide around those at this point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNot really.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenric Tyghe (Analysts)】\nOkay, enough. Fair enough. One final one, just on the gross margin expansion in the quarter, you highlighted the impact of transportation costs, et cetera. Are you able to sort of better handicap how much of the gross margin expansion was transportation and the like? Or are you not inclined to share that with us?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo. But as I mentioned on the last quarter, it's the -- you're talking about the -- majority of the impact on gross margin was FX adjustment-related. There's transportation cost, second; and scaling, third.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nCan you just comment on the new price points? The margin contribution on those price points, is it similar to the 36% to 37% target you guys have?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. Initially, like we said in the past, usually when you introduce them, the percentage margin is a bit lower. You don't get the benefit of -- the quantities and so on. But over time, we try to improve on that margin. The dollar contribution is higher, but the percentage is not. It's usually a bit lower.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nOkay, understood. And have you guys witnessed any impact from the slowdown in Western Canada and even in Alberta, Saskatchewan?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo, still not. No real change at all. Every province is moving in sync with the chain as the prior year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just, finally, can you give us any update at all on the Dollar City? How many stores are you guys at down there now? And even just anecdotally, I mean, have you seen sales increase materially since you took over the procurement?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. So I won't disclose how many stores we're at because of some material and we want to respect our confidentiality agreement. But also say -- obviously, the results seem promising but, again, not material about this time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nI'm just wondering are you seeing any resistance to your higher prices? I mean, obviously, your consumers had to face much higher price points than they're used to. Is there any sense of a pushback from them?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWe -- I don't see or feel that. I look at our penetration of higher price points, it's steadily increasing and it has always been steadily increasing.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, if numbers count, I guess, we have to say no to your question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nOkay. And partly following on Kenric's question, but with respect to the buybacks, so am I wrong in assuming that you've increased the current NCIB because of being so far ahead on your sort of free cash flow forecast that you felt you had excess capacity utilized this year? And then as a follow-on to that, what would your thinking be for a renewal in June of 2016?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes, well, I don't know for 20 -- June of 2016, but right now we're following it -- our buyback program closely, obviously. We've been active, as you've noticed, and we're still very much a growing company and continuing to do very well, and we just expect the opportunity to buy back more before next June, so that's why we increased it this quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nAnd any change to your thinking about your net debt to EBITDAR target? Like is it still 3x, generally speaking?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. It's in that range. It was increased to 325 recently by DBRS, the capacity to maintain the current -- our current rating. So DBRS recently increased it, but -- and always using 8 as a factor to capitalize operating leases when we're talking about 3 and 325. Otherwise, if you use 6 as a factor, it's 275x, but we're -- we would keep ourselves some wiggle room. Obviously, we do also the some share buybacks on an opportunistic basis as much as possible, obviously.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then my last question, just factor the new store growth outlook. Larry, I've kind of lost track of where we're at on trying to do smaller stores. I know at one time that was kind of the focus, and I think you were not necessarily wowed by the results. If we're seeing 10,000 square-foot box opportunities potentially get quite tight, does that reinvigorate your interest in smaller stores in trying to make those work?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI don't think I was negative to it. I said that as long as we have opportunities to keep finding 10,000 square-foot boxes, 10 or 10 to 15 even, we -- that would be our preference. I think it's harder to manage smaller store surfaces. I mean, whether they're -- they don't have to all -- go all the way down to 5. 5 is almost a different business, but they can go 9 to 8 to 7, even to 6, but that's getting pretty hard to manage. And if we have better management tools, so as time goes on, we can be more selective and possibly better manage 6, 7, 5 -- 5,000, 6,000 7,000, 8,000-foot stores. But ideally, it would be nice to continue to find offices and opportunities at 10,000 to 15,000 feet, if we can. And now when the time comes that we can't and we have these better management tools, we'll take a look at it, but we have opened 7,000-footers of late, 7,000 to 8,000 footers. And they usually have basements in them. So that gives us a little bit of help. And what we save on those 2,000, 3,000 feet, we usually put into labor because you're receiving into basements and then transporting merchandise on a daily basis up and down. To open a 5,000-footer with no basement is almost a different business and we'll look at them and those opportunities when we have to, but it's the same manager, it's the same labor, and I don't think we're far from being exhausted at the 10,000 to 15,000-foot box. I believe we still have a ways to go, but I'm certainly not negative to looking at it, not at all. Not at all.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nHow are you finding rent? Is there pressure on rent?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nNo. I think I would say stable, particularly out west, where things are a little rougher. But in renewals, we renew many leases at the same as we have. And when you're saying the same, that's a 10-year lease with a bump usually after 5 years within that 10 years. So we're usually being able to keep our rents, I would say, pretty constant, giving -- you're going to have some increases, you're going to have some sames and you're going to have a few with decreases. So generally speaking, and I think it's -- they're pretty similar. So no major, like I said a few years ago, that it was -- I don't think that exists any longer at the moment. Things change quickly, but they don't -- if you ask me the question today, so today, I would say not.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nJust wondering about your guidance range and is there conditions there? I mean, you mentioned -- you called out the currency and you expect the Canadian dollar to be weaker perhaps, I guess, in your budgets going forward. I mean, what are the conditions that would take your margins higher than the ranges that you've provided other than currency? Do you see opportunity there? Or are you being kind of modest or conservative in your outlook?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWell, Dave, we've shown clearly over the past 2 years that we can manage the margin, and we've explained the -- and you see what happens when there's a sharp increase in the margin and that was the effect of that. Now we're managing it back to our comfort zone. So we will adjust whenever the currency does, and we've demonstrated that again. And what we're, I guess, telling you is that our comfort zone is not at the current level. It's -- so we want to keep that compellingness out there and reinvest into the products. So we're bringing down the margin to 36%, 37%.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, and I can add that I don't think there's an opportunity to go above -- well, 35%, 38%, 39% because I don't think we can give the compelling value, which is the key motivation to our existence here. The compelling value that we've been giving, if we try to push the margins higher, I think we should be happy at what they are. I've always said that -- I've always used the word vulgar actually, but I'll take it back just for our sakes. It's out there in the public now, but I would be very happy. I think when we went public, we were in the 34% to 35% area. And at that time, I was very happy, and with those results, today we're, well, exceptional. Let's say we're 37%, 38%, 39%, let's forget the 40% for a moment. So I have to be satisfied with that and I think everybody should be. We're still giving great value, and that is #1. Our SSSs reflect that. So to strive for more markup, I don't think would be the right thing to do.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nWhat about on the SG&A as a percentage of sales? The ranges you've given, I think there's a lot of folks out there at the bottom end or lower than that in their projections. Is there conditions there that would take the number below that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo, the -- well, no. I mean, the numbers we gave you are the numbers that we are comfortable with. So...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nAre there conditions? That would happen but I think you're...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes, the likelihood of -- I mean, the best likelihood is between 16.5% and 17% for the year, this year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nAnd my final question, just on kind of price points and relative price points to, I guess, other retailers, other forms of competition out there. So you're moving to the $3.50 and $4 price points. You're giving kind of a muted expectations for the contribution certainly for next year. Can you take us beyond that into, say, 2018? I mean, we've seen in previous that you've slowly rolled out products that are of a higher price. We're very careful about how you manage the margins and customer expectations and maintaining value and a proposition, in general, of value to the consumer. Does it get tougher here? Are past the sort of tipping point? Because you seem -- your guidance around those products seem much more modest perhaps in tone than I think I've heard in the past from you, and maybe you can answer that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. I'll let Neil give a little color to that question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nI think that in true Larry tradition, he's continuing to be modest. For sure because of the timing of those 2 new price points, the impact on next year will be less than it will be the year after. But I think that as the buyers continued to get used to the price points to find great values, there will be an impact, a positive impact both to our customer shopping experience and to the overall basket.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nAnd if I can ask just one more following that, thanks, Neil. Just with regard to store size, the offering size, as you  move -- and maybe early for this, but as you move into higher price points, maybe bigger products, other things, do you see -- foresee a need where you have to increase your store size at all, look to Dollarama plus or something like that where you -- as you push forward in your evolution?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nSo we have someone asking us about a Dollarama express and you're asking me about a Dollarama plus. Look, it's all rent-dependent. If I can get 15,000 feet at what I feel are good terms, we'll do that. Will that allow us to put the larger $4 articles in those stores? And larger by -- I mean, cube wise. And what will that mean? It's pretty tough to give you a little bit of insight into that. I think, basically, the extra space allows us to better merchandise our present assortment, and it'll evolve in time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Morrison (Analysts)】\nI've got a couple of follow-up questions on the guidance. Michael, with respect to the gross margin, the 200-basis-point increase in the target gross margin, relative to, say, you're historical norm, I'm wondering if you might be able to go into a little bit more detail as to what is attributable to the pricing increase relative to the hedges wearing off, what's attributable to the decline in transport costs and what's attributable to the scale, or at least address the pricing increase at a minimum?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWell, yes. I'm not going to go into details of pricing increase, but definitely, while we're refreshing 25% to 30% of our items, we take into account the currency. Because of the steep increase again, the -- instead of using the actual hedge rate that you will be paying the item initially, you're using the higher rate, which is the spot rate to determine what your price should be to long term meet your margin requirement. So we're -- the next time you refresh the same item, so that you don't have to mark it up 6 months later, you set the price accordingly. And obviously, the buyers comp shop and make sure that it's -- will be compelling at that price. So that's what has been going on. And so as you roll out from your hedges and you catch up to that spot rate, when you're refreshing those same items, the cost of the currency is higher and the margin shrinks back to the levels that we were used to, 36%, to 37%. Transport has been contributing also, the scaling impact too, but I think that with the assumptions and the outlook, the assumptions being 4% to 5% same-store sales next year and the gross margin and G&A range, it's been still ending up in the 20% EBITDA range, is still obviously very good.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Morrison (Analysts)】\nNo, I understand the mechanics. I just -- is it fair to say with the appreciation or depreciation of the Canadian dollar being so rapid that the majority of that gross margin increase this year that is attributable to pricing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nIn other words, the buyers were duped into pricing goods at $1.30 when in actuality, we had hedges of $1.10, $1.10, $1.10, $1.08, $1.12. So we priced at $1.30 and it worked out. It just made us work harder.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Morrison (Analysts)】\nOn the new store count, then, when you mentioned that the run rate, it could be a little bit tighter in terms of the availability of 10,000-foot stores, does that at all impact your forecast new store or your total store count total? I think it's 1,400.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo. That remains, and even -- I mean, last year, when we mentioned for the first time that we were setting that new objective at 1,400, which is clearly still the case, we said that for this year, we have 70 to 80 and that you should use 60 stores as an average, giving us a 6- to 7-year runway. So nothing has changed.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Morrison (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then the last question, more out of curiosity than anything else, why did you decide to use BC as your pilot market for your credit card?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes, okay. So the reason being BC is a good -- has a good sized sample of stores. It's representative of the chain in terms of basket size, mix of payment methods. So it's a more or less the same as the chain, and we wanted -- we were targeting a specific market, which would help avoid confusion at other store levels. So we're using a province, a total province, which is BC. And so what we're looking for is to improve the shopping experience of our customers while stimulating more sales to offset the cost.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Morrison (Analysts)】\nIs -- would it be taken with the fact that a major competitor is -- has a bigger presence in that region? Will that have anything to do with it or no?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo, no.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nDidn't think of that. You just brought it up and just thought of it just now. You -- because you brought it up. And also when we threw the coin up in the air, it landed on BC. So there was not much other than we felt that going to one of the extremities of the country would be easier to handle in case this pilot failed and gave us the same results, but I think we have better metrics to measure success today than we did in 2010. And I'm a little bit more confident that in 2010, I was not confident that, that would work but I'm a little bit more confident today that it may work.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nAnd you're right, Larry. And it's a good opportunity to test that market as it stands today and under more favorable terms also.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nJust some questions on SG&A expense rate. Can you roughly break it down between variable expense versus fixed expense?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nIt's still in the 85%, 15% range. 85% being variable, 15% fixed.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd then just in terms of the gross margin rate, you don't tend to put many or I think you have a policy not to put too many higher price points in the consumables area. And so I'm wondering if there's a natural shift of gross margin higher as you -- given that some -- I presume sales of general merchandise and seasonal grow faster as you shift this product mix or product price points or maybe not?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, I think at this point, I could say that we've made the point in the past that we're trying to stick and we've succeeded in doing so and we -- those are our full intentions on grocery items not to go over the $2 price point. So yes, your perception is correct. So on consumables, mainly grocery items. I'm not sure about the other consumers. Neil, are you trying to stick to any? No. So on consumables, foodstuffs, we're trying to stay at the $2 price point at maximum. And on the rest, well, the rest is the rest. So again, unless I've answered your question, I don't think I have anything else to say.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nSo will there be a gradual shift, upward movement in gross margin given that consumables tend to be a lower gross margin category and you're not really adding higher price points or...?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, we're losing margin trying to keep staying at $2, by the way. On foodstuffs basically, grocery items, we don't concentrate on that area, but we're certainly losing gross margin by not being able to go over $2, so I don't expect that to add to gross margins. We're not expanding the range, but basically with the rest of the nonfood items, we'll continue to provide value where we can, I guess. Again, I'm not sure if I've answered your question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nAnd when we say that we're losing margin on the food because of the limited price point, that is until the buyer has time to adjust to the challenges of foreign exchange. Eventually, we're still working back to it as targeted margin within that price range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd then just in terms of credit cards and debit cards, do you get any information at all on an anonymous basis on debit cards? Like can you track some debit card number, how much they shop or how they shop?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo, not at all. We don't have access to any customer information.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd does that change with credit card or not really?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo. It's the same system. All our systems are credit-card-enable, tap and go, everything. So it's just turning on the switch, very simple, no -- everything is there and yes, that's pretty simple.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd just on the technology, will you be doing any pilots this holiday period on the WiFi-enabled alternative cash, alternative payment lines, et cetera?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. There are some going on in certain stores, but the benefits from this, you'll start seeing more next year. This year, it's not material yet.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd the tap and go is next year also or now or...?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo. It's already in place. It has been in place for a month or so.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nOkay. Well, you better get it at Scarborough Town Center, I can tell you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo -- okay.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nNo, just -- and just on the talk about the physical space and the number of stores, is the issue of number of stores not really related to what landlords have available but to where you want to put a store or where competitors are located or...?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, I think it's not an issue of where competitors are located really. I mean, if I could have my choice, I'd be next to the draw, but we kind of go anywhere it's available. And sometimes they'll do things to make sure that we get in. I mean, landlords consider us more favorably than they did 15 years ago. That's a good thing. It doesn't guarantee pricing, but it's a good thing that they want us as opposed to not want us. And I, again, I think I've answered your question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then just finally on your initiative in Central and South America, are you at the point where you might want to look at one of the other countries within the agreement with your partner?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWell, we have a possibility of 9, but I'm not -- as I mentioned earlier, I don't want to disclose more than I need to because of the confidentiality agreement, but you're aware of the countries. We've mentioned those in the past, Central American countries, and so we're -- and we mentioned to you that we were looking at Colombia, but that's as far as we need to go.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; and John Garratt, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases.\r\nLet me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other historical matters, including, but not limited to, our 2015 forecasted financial results and capital expenditures; our planned fiscal 2015 and 2016 operating, merchandising, store growth and prototype initiatives; our capital allocation strategy and expectations; and statements regarding future economic trends.\r\nImportant factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning; our 2014 10-K, which was filed on March 20, 2015; 2015 third quarter 10-Q filed this morning; and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or otherwise revise any information discussed in this call. \r\nWe will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which, as I had mentioned, is posted on dollargeneral.com in the Investor Information, Press Releases section.\r\nNow it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. This morning, we announced our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2015, along with an incremental $1 billion share repurchase authorization.\r\nReturning cash to shareholders remains a top priority, and we expect to deliver nearly $1.6 billion to shareholders during 2015 through both anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividends.\r\nAdditionally, I'm very pleased to announce John Garratt has been promoted to CFO. I have gotten to know John very well over the last 15 months, and he is an accomplished executive with significant financial experience. As interim CFO, John has already played a key role as we look to implement our zero-based budgeting process and execute our new store growth. I look forward to his further and future contributions at Dollar General.\r\nTurning now to the quarter. Our initiatives are showing success relative to our long-term goals as we continue to drive profitable sales growth. We have the right team in place to capture high-return, low-risk organic growth opportunities. We are aggressively taking steps to position Dollar General to be successful regardless of the retail sales environment.\r\nI am pleased with the way the team managed the business given the continued overall weaker retail environment across the sector. For us, our core consumer is still struggling as she continues to face rising costs in major expenditure categories, like rent and health care, with no real income growth. We believe that our core consumer is closely monitoring her spending not just with us, but across all retail.\r\nTurning to some of the highlights for the quarter and year-to-date to the third quarter. Third quarter sales increased 7.3% to $5.1 billion. Year-to-date, total sales were $15.1 billion, an increase of 8%. \r\nWe delivered same-store sales growth of 2.3% for the quarter. Adjusting for the Halloween shift to Q4, same-store sales were fairly consistent across all periods of the quarter. \r\nWe estimate this Halloween shift was a 20 to 30 basis point negative impact on same-store sales in the third quarter. Same-store sales increased 2.9% year-to-date through the third quarter. Sales per square foot were $225.\r\nFor the 31st consecutive quarter when compared to the prior year quarter, we increased both our customer traffic and average ticket. Gross margin expanded by 19 basis points to 30.3% in the third quarter. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $0.86. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $0.88. \r\nDuring the quarter, we returned $340 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 3.8 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend.\r\nGiven our performance year-to-date, we are updating our full year financial outlook. We expect same-store sales will likely be in the range of 2.5% to 2.8% for fiscal 2015. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 is expected to be in the range of $3.87 to $3.92, and adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.88 to $3.93.\r\nWe continue to grow transactions and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. We experienced consistent mid-single-digit growth in both units and dollars for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods.\r\nLet's turn now to a more detailed review of our growth drivers. Our real estate program is the foundation for our growth with a proven high-return, low-risk model. We remained disciplined and focused on financial returns. We continue to see our new store productivity at around 85% of our comp base, all while driving strong returns of approximately 20%.\r\nFor 2015, we are on track to open 730 new stores and relocate or remodel a combined 875 stores. The average sales performance of our new stores is running ahead of our forecast.\r\nLooking ahead for 2016, our pipeline is full as we continue to plan for approximately 7% square footage growth or about 900 new store openings.\r\nThe real estate team has continued to build upon this progress with the 2017 pipeline, which is starting out at a greater pace than our 2016 pipeline, as we look to continue to capitalize on the strength of our real estate model. \r\nWith our real estate strategy firmly in place, we continue to support our new store growth through the build-out of our distribution network. Our location in San Antonio, Texas is anticipated to begin receiving products this month and shipping in February of 2016.\r\nWe just broke ground in November for our 14th distribution center located in Janesville, Wisconsin. These investments are key to driving the efficiency and speed of our network to support our growing store base.\r\nIn-store, our targeted labor investments to grow market share in a competitive environment are providing positive financial returns. Currently, we've completed 2 of the 3 phases of the labor investment rollout across approximately 2,400 stores.\r\nRecall that phase 1 rolled out in the second quarter, phase 2 was implemented in the third quarter, and phase 3 is scheduled to roll out during the fourth quarter. We continue to see same-store sales growth for our phase 1 stores gain traction since the second quarter roll out.\r\nPhase 1 stores are the only stores that have been on the program long enough to really see an impact. Phase 1 stores are on track to deliver on our return expectations. Specifically, in these stores, the key metrics of same-store sales, transactions, average basket and customer satisfaction scores, are all showing significant improvement.\r\nAdditionally, across the chain, our store teams are focused on improving our on-shelf availability. The teams are leveraging retail basics, such as stocking and inventory management, to make progress. We are validating our on-shelf availability through the use of third-party audits.\r\nSince our recommitment to the on-shelf availability, our teams are making great improvement in a very short time as evidenced by our customer satisfaction scores. Our customer is recognizing our better in-stock position not only in the stores receiving the incremental labor investment, but across the chain as our scores are at the highest level in over a year.\r\nAnd finally, as an indicator that these actions are resonating, we are seeing the best performance in 3 years for improving store manager turnover rates.\r\nDuring the third quarter, we accomplished a major milestone related to the multiyear rollout of our enterprise resource planning software for our supply chain. This technology platform represents a significant improvement with enhanced integration to allow for demand forecasting from the vendor to shelf. The team executed this initiative without disruption to the business.\r\nOn a combined basis, we believe these labor investments and inventory management initiatives are significant steps to improving our in-stock position, which is a critical component of our overall customer satisfaction and a driver of sales performance.\r\nOn the merchandising front, we had a positive same-store sales growth across all categories in the third quarter, with higher growth in consumables than in non-consumable categories. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter for improved -- improvement in our non-consumable categories.\r\nStrength in consumables was driven by growth in candy and snacks, tobacco and perishables. Within the non-consumable categories, sundries, housewares, hardware and ladies clothing all exhibited strong growth. \r\nConsistent with our recent trends, our consumer continued to shop the holiday close to the event. Our sell-through of Halloween and harvest merchandise was robust with a 90 basis point improvement year-over-year when taking into account the calendar shift into the fourth quarter this year.\r\nShrink improvement has been and continues to be one of our largest gross margin opportunities. We remain committed to reduce our shrink on a store-by-store basis.\r\nFor the quarter, we are extremely pleased with our shrink improvement. This progress continues to be broad-based year-to-date, with shrink declining across nearly 70% of our product departments. Going forward, our teams continue to be focused on leveraging our defensive merchandising tools, technology and training to further reduce shrink.\r\nTurning to the holiday season. We have offers online and in store for savings on electronics, game items, toys, gift options, small kitchen appliances, food and much more. We had exciting specials in the week leading into Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday weekend that further allowed our customers to -- the opportunity to stretch their budget and save even more. \r\nOur toy business is off to a strong start. We are currently offering consumers an immediate 25% discount off of all qualifying toy purchases of $75 or more, both online and in stores. This year, about 70% of our toy offerings are branded or licensed products, which resonate with our customers as being on trend and communicating value.\r\nWe are capitalizing on our consumer insights to strengthen our merchandising offering across product categories. In turn, this will be supported by a robust print and digital marketing calendar. We continue to capitalize on new ways to wow our consumers. We are focused on expanding high-opportunity categories and giving our customers the trend-right products she wants at affordable prices.\r\nNow let me turn the call over to John.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. It is an honor and a privilege to be the new CFO of Dollar General. I am excited to have the chance to work with such a great team. To be named CFO is a tremendous opportunity as we continue to work together to invest for growth and to continue to create shareholder value over time. \r\nAs Todd has taken you through the highlights of our third quarter, I'll share more insights on some of the important financial details and our outlook. \r\nIn the third quarter, we took important actions to continue driving the types of returns we expect from our business over time. Gross profit for the third quarter was $1.5 billion or 30.3% of sales, an increase of 19 basis points from last year's third quarter. As compared to the prior year, the most significant drivers were an improved inventory shrink rate and lower transportation cost, partially offset by sales mix.\r\nSG&A expense in the quarter increased by 18 basis points over the comparable 2014 period to $1.1 billion or 22% of sales. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to our restructuring charge for onetime severance-related benefits of $6.1 million or 12 basis points.\r\nThe 2015 third quarter also reflects increases in store incentive compensation expenses, repairs and maintenance, occupancy costs and advertising expenses. Partially offsetting these items were lower utilities costs and a reduction in employee benefit costs.\r\nThe 2014 quarter reflects expenses of $8.2 million related to an attempted acquisition that was not completed, partially offset by unrelated insurance proceeds of $3.4 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37%.\r\nMoving now to our balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $3.1 billion, up 5.1% on a per-store basis. Key factors impacting this increase were our on-shelf availability initiative and the timing of receipts, coupled with our sales performance. Even with this increase, we believe our inventory is in good shape, and we are comfortable with the quality. Going forward, our goal remains to ensure inventory growth is in line with our total sales growth over time.\r\nYear-to-date, we generated cash from operations of $781 million, $60 million lower as compared to the same period last year. Changes in merchandise inventories and accounts payable were the key drivers of the reduction in cash flows. This was offset in part by increased net income of approximately $80 million. Total capital expenditures were $387 million.\r\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares of our common stock for $275 million. We also paid a dividend of $0.22 per common share outstanding totaling $64 million.\r\nSince the inception of the share repurchase program in December of 2011, we have repurchased over $3.3 billion of our common stock. With today's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization of $1 billion, we currently have a remaining authorization of approximately $1.2 billion under the repurchase program.\r\nWe remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our growth. Our goal is to create lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment-grade rating and managing to a leverage ratio approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA.\r\nDuring the quarter, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes, the proceeds of which were used to reduce a portion of the term loan. We also increased our revolver size and extended the maturity of our credit facility.\r\nAlso, during the quarter, we are pleased to note that S&P upgraded our credit ratings to BBB from BBB-, and Moody's upgraded our outlook to positive from stable.\r\nTurning now to guidance. We are updating our financial guidance ranges for 2015. Details of our guidance are included in our press release. Highlights include: Total sales for the year are expected to increase approximately 8%; expectations for overall selling square footage growth remain at approximately 6%; and for the year, same-store sales are expected to increase by about 2.5% to 2.8%.\r\nPlease note that it is still very early in the quarter for us and our customer tends to shop closer to events. \r\nWe have narrowed our expectations for the adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $3.88 to $3.93 for the year. This guidance assumes the reinstatement of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit back to the beginning of the year, which has always been included in our full year guidance. The impact of the tax credit is approximately $0.05 per share. There can be no assurance that this tax credit will be retroactively reinstated or reinstated at all in the fourth quarter.\r\nWe are deep in the budgeting process for 2016. The team is focused on sales initiatives to drive the top line, coupled with a zero-based budgeting mindset to reduce cost and SG&A. We are committed to getting our leverage point below our recent historical level of approximately 3.5% for same-store sales growth. I believe our budget actions should help us deliver strong results for our shareholders over time. \r\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Todd.\n\n---\n\nThank you, John. As I look to the future for Dollar General, I have a clear vision on where we want to be and how to get there. We have brought together a great team over the course of the last 6 months. \r\nSince being named CEO in June, I have had the opportunity to visit with Dollar General employees at many levels in the organization, travel across the United States visiting stores and listening to our consumers. The culture of serving others is meaningful to the employees of Dollar General, and it is important to our consumers. We see a real opportunity to continue to save our consumers time and money every day.\r\nLooking ahead to 2016, the team is focused on 4 key priorities to improve our overall results for the long term: first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, leveraging our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are taking positive steps to position Dollar General for continued success with these 4 priorities as our guide and our consumer at the center of everything we do. \r\nOn the consumer front, we are revisiting our brand archetype to ensure we are connecting with our consumers and differentiating our brand. This would help us better define how we communicate with our consumers and impact all customer-facing communications, including circulars, in-store branding and digital advertising. At the same time, we are updating our consumer segmentation as the foundation for strategies to drive product mix and assortment, marketing and even real estate.\r\nWe have completed our initial strategic planning process for 2016, and the teams continue to refine our initiatives. First, our actions to drive profitable sales begins and ends with our disciplined approach to category management. This allows -- this also, excuse me, includes expansion of categories that are most likely to drive traffic to our stores, including increased penetration in our legacy stores. Our ongoing affordability initiative will be front and center with the refreshed approach. We will also leverage operational initiatives such as improving our on-shelf availability.\r\nSecond, we will focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Examples include our accelerated square footage growth in 2016, with the new store prototype that we will -- we plan to roll out to all new stores, relocations and remodels. The format will allow for high-growth, traffic-building categories to be expanded all in more customer-friendly layout with faster checkout. A new category optimization tool will also be deployed and will also make sure that it has optimized our assortments as we go forward into 2016.\r\nThird, we will leverage our -- and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. We recently undertook a broad-based initiative to proactively improve our efficiencies and reduce expenses over a multiyear time frame, all while giving us the flexibility to reinvest savings to drive growth. We eliminated approximately 255 positions across our corporate support functions to improve our flexibility while positioning us to better serve our consumers.\r\nOur zero-based budgeting approach is a refreshed commitment to removing cost from our business. We are targeting cost savings in specific budget categories. All these actions are filtered through 3 lenses: first, is it customer-facing; two, does it align with our strategic priorities; and finally, third, how does it impact our risk profile. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator. \r\nFourth is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are a competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store management development through great onboarding and training and open communication. Continued improvement in store management turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate turnover.\r\nI look forward to sharing more details about our plans at an Investor Day scheduled for March 23 and 24 here in Nashville. Our goal is to allow plenty of time for interaction with our management team and share insights to our growth drivers for the long term. \r\nAt Dollar General, we are moving fast and investing in the future. We continue to believe that our future is very bright. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value is unchanged. We have a business model that is proven and resilient. Our team is energized to seize growth opportunities. Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in accelerated store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and anticipated dividends.\r\nAs we are in the midst of the busiest season of retail, I'd like to extend my appreciation and thanks to the nearly 114,000 Dollar General employees that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our consumers with the convenience, value and service every day.\r\nWith that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions.\n\n---\n\nGreat.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; and John Garratt, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases.\r\nLet me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other historical matters, including, but not limited to, our 2015 forecasted financial results and capital expenditures; our planned fiscal 2015 and 2016 operating, merchandising, store growth and prototype initiatives; our capital allocation strategy and expectations; and statements regarding future economic trends.\r\nImportant factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning; our 2014 10-K, which was filed on March 20, 2015; 2015 third quarter 10-Q filed this morning; and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or otherwise revise any information discussed in this call. \r\nWe will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which, as I had mentioned, is posted on dollargeneral.com in the Investor Information, Press Releases section.\r\nNow it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nThank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. This morning, we announced our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2015, along with an incremental $1 billion share repurchase authorization.\r\nReturning cash to shareholders remains a top priority, and we expect to deliver nearly $1.6 billion to shareholders during 2015 through both anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividends.\r\nAdditionally, I'm very pleased to announce John Garratt has been promoted to CFO. I have gotten to know John very well over the last 15 months, and he is an accomplished executive with significant financial experience. As interim CFO, John has already played a key role as we look to implement our zero-based budgeting process and execute our new store growth. I look forward to his further and future contributions at Dollar General.\r\nTurning now to the quarter. Our initiatives are showing success relative to our long-term goals as we continue to drive profitable sales growth. We have the right team in place to capture high-return, low-risk organic growth opportunities. We are aggressively taking steps to position Dollar General to be successful regardless of the retail sales environment.\r\nI am pleased with the way the team managed the business given the continued overall weaker retail environment across the sector. For us, our core consumer is still struggling as she continues to face rising costs in major expenditure categories, like rent and health care, with no real income growth. We believe that our core consumer is closely monitoring her spending not just with us, but across all retail.\r\nTurning to some of the highlights for the quarter and year-to-date to the third quarter. Third quarter sales increased 7.3% to $5.1 billion. Year-to-date, total sales were $15.1 billion, an increase of 8%. \r\nWe delivered same-store sales growth of 2.3% for the quarter. Adjusting for the Halloween shift to Q4, same-store sales were fairly consistent across all periods of the quarter. \r\nWe estimate this Halloween shift was a 20 to 30 basis point negative impact on same-store sales in the third quarter. Same-store sales increased 2.9% year-to-date through the third quarter. Sales per square foot were $225.\r\nFor the 31st consecutive quarter when compared to the prior year quarter, we increased both our customer traffic and average ticket. Gross margin expanded by 19 basis points to 30.3% in the third quarter. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $0.86. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $0.88. \r\nDuring the quarter, we returned $340 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 3.8 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend.\r\nGiven our performance year-to-date, we are updating our full year financial outlook. We expect same-store sales will likely be in the range of 2.5% to 2.8% for fiscal 2015. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 is expected to be in the range of $3.87 to $3.92, and adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.88 to $3.93.\r\nWe continue to grow transactions and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. We experienced consistent mid-single-digit growth in both units and dollars for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods.\r\nLet's turn now to a more detailed review of our growth drivers. Our real estate program is the foundation for our growth with a proven high-return, low-risk model. We remained disciplined and focused on financial returns. We continue to see our new store productivity at around 85% of our comp base, all while driving strong returns of approximately 20%.\r\nFor 2015, we are on track to open 730 new stores and relocate or remodel a combined 875 stores. The average sales performance of our new stores is running ahead of our forecast.\r\nLooking ahead for 2016, our pipeline is full as we continue to plan for approximately 7% square footage growth or about 900 new store openings.\r\nThe real estate team has continued to build upon this progress with the 2017 pipeline, which is starting out at a greater pace than our 2016 pipeline, as we look to continue to capitalize on the strength of our real estate model. \r\nWith our real estate strategy firmly in place, we continue to support our new store growth through the build-out of our distribution network. Our location in San Antonio, Texas is anticipated to begin receiving products this month and shipping in February of 2016.\r\nWe just broke ground in November for our 14th distribution center located in Janesville, Wisconsin. These investments are key to driving the efficiency and speed of our network to support our growing store base.\r\nIn-store, our targeted labor investments to grow market share in a competitive environment are providing positive financial returns. Currently, we've completed 2 of the 3 phases of the labor investment rollout across approximately 2,400 stores.\r\nRecall that phase 1 rolled out in the second quarter, phase 2 was implemented in the third quarter, and phase 3 is scheduled to roll out during the fourth quarter. We continue to see same-store sales growth for our phase 1 stores gain traction since the second quarter roll out.\r\nPhase 1 stores are the only stores that have been on the program long enough to really see an impact. Phase 1 stores are on track to deliver on our return expectations. Specifically, in these stores, the key metrics of same-store sales, transactions, average basket and customer satisfaction scores, are all showing significant improvement.\r\nAdditionally, across the chain, our store teams are focused on improving our on-shelf availability. The teams are leveraging retail basics, such as stocking and inventory management, to make progress. We are validating our on-shelf availability through the use of third-party audits.\r\nSince our recommitment to the on-shelf availability, our teams are making great improvement in a very short time as evidenced by our customer satisfaction scores. Our customer is recognizing our better in-stock position not only in the stores receiving the incremental labor investment, but across the chain as our scores are at the highest level in over a year.\r\nAnd finally, as an indicator that these actions are resonating, we are seeing the best performance in 3 years for improving store manager turnover rates.\r\nDuring the third quarter, we accomplished a major milestone related to the multiyear rollout of our enterprise resource planning software for our supply chain. This technology platform represents a significant improvement with enhanced integration to allow for demand forecasting from the vendor to shelf. The team executed this initiative without disruption to the business.\r\nOn a combined basis, we believe these labor investments and inventory management initiatives are significant steps to improving our in-stock position, which is a critical component of our overall customer satisfaction and a driver of sales performance.\r\nOn the merchandising front, we had a positive same-store sales growth across all categories in the third quarter, with higher growth in consumables than in non-consumable categories. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter for improved -- improvement in our non-consumable categories.\r\nStrength in consumables was driven by growth in candy and snacks, tobacco and perishables. Within the non-consumable categories, sundries, housewares, hardware and ladies clothing all exhibited strong growth. \r\nConsistent with our recent trends, our consumer continued to shop the holiday close to the event. Our sell-through of Halloween and harvest merchandise was robust with a 90 basis point improvement year-over-year when taking into account the calendar shift into the fourth quarter this year.\r\nShrink improvement has been and continues to be one of our largest gross margin opportunities. We remain committed to reduce our shrink on a store-by-store basis.\r\nFor the quarter, we are extremely pleased with our shrink improvement. This progress continues to be broad-based year-to-date, with shrink declining across nearly 70% of our product departments. Going forward, our teams continue to be focused on leveraging our defensive merchandising tools, technology and training to further reduce shrink.\r\nTurning to the holiday season. We have offers online and in store for savings on electronics, game items, toys, gift options, small kitchen appliances, food and much more. We had exciting specials in the week leading into Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday weekend that further allowed our customers to -- the opportunity to stretch their budget and save even more. \r\nOur toy business is off to a strong start. We are currently offering consumers an immediate 25% discount off of all qualifying toy purchases of $75 or more, both online and in stores. This year, about 70% of our toy offerings are branded or licensed products, which resonate with our customers as being on trend and communicating value.\r\nWe are capitalizing on our consumer insights to strengthen our merchandising offering across product categories. In turn, this will be supported by a robust print and digital marketing calendar. We continue to capitalize on new ways to wow our consumers. We are focused on expanding high-opportunity categories and giving our customers the trend-right products she wants at affordable prices.\r\nNow let me turn the call over to John.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: John Garratt (Executives)】\nThank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. It is an honor and a privilege to be the new CFO of Dollar General. I am excited to have the chance to work with such a great team. To be named CFO is a tremendous opportunity as we continue to work together to invest for growth and to continue to create shareholder value over time. \r\nAs Todd has taken you through the highlights of our third quarter, I'll share more insights on some of the important financial details and our outlook. \r\nIn the third quarter, we took important actions to continue driving the types of returns we expect from our business over time. Gross profit for the third quarter was $1.5 billion or 30.3% of sales, an increase of 19 basis points from last year's third quarter. As compared to the prior year, the most significant drivers were an improved inventory shrink rate and lower transportation cost, partially offset by sales mix.\r\nSG&A expense in the quarter increased by 18 basis points over the comparable 2014 period to $1.1 billion or 22% of sales. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to our restructuring charge for onetime severance-related benefits of $6.1 million or 12 basis points.\r\nThe 2015 third quarter also reflects increases in store incentive compensation expenses, repairs and maintenance, occupancy costs and advertising expenses. Partially offsetting these items were lower utilities costs and a reduction in employee benefit costs.\r\nThe 2014 quarter reflects expenses of $8.2 million related to an attempted acquisition that was not completed, partially offset by unrelated insurance proceeds of $3.4 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37%.\r\nMoving now to our balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $3.1 billion, up 5.1% on a per-store basis. Key factors impacting this increase were our on-shelf availability initiative and the timing of receipts, coupled with our sales performance. Even with this increase, we believe our inventory is in good shape, and we are comfortable with the quality. Going forward, our goal remains to ensure inventory growth is in line with our total sales growth over time.\r\nYear-to-date, we generated cash from operations of $781 million, $60 million lower as compared to the same period last year. Changes in merchandise inventories and accounts payable were the key drivers of the reduction in cash flows. This was offset in part by increased net income of approximately $80 million. Total capital expenditures were $387 million.\r\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares of our common stock for $275 million. We also paid a dividend of $0.22 per common share outstanding totaling $64 million.\r\nSince the inception of the share repurchase program in December of 2011, we have repurchased over $3.3 billion of our common stock. With today's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization of $1 billion, we currently have a remaining authorization of approximately $1.2 billion under the repurchase program.\r\nWe remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our growth. Our goal is to create lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment-grade rating and managing to a leverage ratio approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA.\r\nDuring the quarter, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes, the proceeds of which were used to reduce a portion of the term loan. We also increased our revolver size and extended the maturity of our credit facility.\r\nAlso, during the quarter, we are pleased to note that S&P upgraded our credit ratings to BBB from BBB-, and Moody's upgraded our outlook to positive from stable.\r\nTurning now to guidance. We are updating our financial guidance ranges for 2015. Details of our guidance are included in our press release. Highlights include: Total sales for the year are expected to increase approximately 8%; expectations for overall selling square footage growth remain at approximately 6%; and for the year, same-store sales are expected to increase by about 2.5% to 2.8%.\r\nPlease note that it is still very early in the quarter for us and our customer tends to shop closer to events. \r\nWe have narrowed our expectations for the adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $3.88 to $3.93 for the year. This guidance assumes the reinstatement of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit back to the beginning of the year, which has always been included in our full year guidance. The impact of the tax credit is approximately $0.05 per share. There can be no assurance that this tax credit will be retroactively reinstated or reinstated at all in the fourth quarter.\r\nWe are deep in the budgeting process for 2016. The team is focused on sales initiatives to drive the top line, coupled with a zero-based budgeting mindset to reduce cost and SG&A. We are committed to getting our leverage point below our recent historical level of approximately 3.5% for same-store sales growth. I believe our budget actions should help us deliver strong results for our shareholders over time. \r\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Todd.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nThank you, John. As I look to the future for Dollar General, I have a clear vision on where we want to be and how to get there. We have brought together a great team over the course of the last 6 months. \r\nSince being named CEO in June, I have had the opportunity to visit with Dollar General employees at many levels in the organization, travel across the United States visiting stores and listening to our consumers. The culture of serving others is meaningful to the employees of Dollar General, and it is important to our consumers. We see a real opportunity to continue to save our consumers time and money every day.\r\nLooking ahead to 2016, the team is focused on 4 key priorities to improve our overall results for the long term: first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, leveraging our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are taking positive steps to position Dollar General for continued success with these 4 priorities as our guide and our consumer at the center of everything we do. \r\nOn the consumer front, we are revisiting our brand archetype to ensure we are connecting with our consumers and differentiating our brand. This would help us better define how we communicate with our consumers and impact all customer-facing communications, including circulars, in-store branding and digital advertising. At the same time, we are updating our consumer segmentation as the foundation for strategies to drive product mix and assortment, marketing and even real estate.\r\nWe have completed our initial strategic planning process for 2016, and the teams continue to refine our initiatives. First, our actions to drive profitable sales begins and ends with our disciplined approach to category management. This allows -- this also, excuse me, includes expansion of categories that are most likely to drive traffic to our stores, including increased penetration in our legacy stores. Our ongoing affordability initiative will be front and center with the refreshed approach. We will also leverage operational initiatives such as improving our on-shelf availability.\r\nSecond, we will focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Examples include our accelerated square footage growth in 2016, with the new store prototype that we will -- we plan to roll out to all new stores, relocations and remodels. The format will allow for high-growth, traffic-building categories to be expanded all in more customer-friendly layout with faster checkout. A new category optimization tool will also be deployed and will also make sure that it has optimized our assortments as we go forward into 2016.\r\nThird, we will leverage our -- and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. We recently undertook a broad-based initiative to proactively improve our efficiencies and reduce expenses over a multiyear time frame, all while giving us the flexibility to reinvest savings to drive growth. We eliminated approximately 255 positions across our corporate support functions to improve our flexibility while positioning us to better serve our consumers.\r\nOur zero-based budgeting approach is a refreshed commitment to removing cost from our business. We are targeting cost savings in specific budget categories. All these actions are filtered through 3 lenses: first, is it customer-facing; two, does it align with our strategic priorities; and finally, third, how does it impact our risk profile. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator. \r\nFourth is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are a competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store management development through great onboarding and training and open communication. Continued improvement in store management turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate turnover.\r\nI look forward to sharing more details about our plans at an Investor Day scheduled for March 23 and 24 here in Nashville. Our goal is to allow plenty of time for interaction with our management team and share insights to our growth drivers for the long term. \r\nAt Dollar General, we are moving fast and investing in the future. We continue to believe that our future is very bright. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value is unchanged. We have a business model that is proven and resilient. Our team is energized to seize growth opportunities. Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in accelerated store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and anticipated dividends.\r\nAs we are in the midst of the busiest season of retail, I'd like to extend my appreciation and thanks to the nearly 114,000 Dollar General employees that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our consumers with the convenience, value and service every day.\r\nWith that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nGreat.",
      "transcript_text3": "Congrats, John. So Todd, between your discussion of zero-based budgeting, being the low-cost operator, capturing profitable growth, what do you think the right comp rate is in order to generate leverage in the business if it's not 3.5%? And how do you get there in a world where consumables are growing faster than discretionary and putting pressure on your gross margin and you've based the potential of wage pressure over the long term?\n\n---\n\nYes. Michael, the way we see the business is, first of all, we have a very robust category management process here. And that process that we implemented well over 7 years ago has served us very well in being able to balance that consumable and non-consumable mix. While consumables continue to dominate our sales, I have to say that I'm very proud of where our non-consumable business has come. We never lost sight of our non-consumable businesses even through some of the real harsh times our consumer was going through back in 2009, '10 and coming out of that Great Recession that we had, and that continues now. We've had a nice string of consecutive quarters that our non-consumable businesses had been pretty strong. And then as you look at being that low-cost operator, we are committed to that. And I have to say, a little bit more to come as we get into 2016 on that. But I can tell you that it is our goal to ensure that, that leverage ratio comes down off of that 3.5%, and we'll be able to leverage our expenses at a much lower rate than it currently is.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And my follow-up question is really in 2 parts. First, on the margin outlook for the fourth quarter, if -- to get to the midpoint of the range, it looks like you're going to have to assume 50 basis points or so of margin degradation. Is that right? And where is that coming from? And then could you clarify what you mean by consumers are shopping closer to events? Does that mean that it could start off a little volatile and you're still expecting trends to pick up as we get closer to Christmas?\n\n---\n\nYes, sure, Mike. Well, let me answer the -- your second question first, and I'll pass it over to John to talk to gross margin with you. As we see it, our core consumer, because she is always very cash-strapped, she does shop closer to the event. So whether it'd be 4th of July during the summer, whether it'd be Halloween in the fall or even holiday time around Christmas, she tends to shop heavier in the days leading into those holidays. Now she's always been that way, but we've seen it get a little bit closer to the holiday each and every year now for the last few years. And when you really look at our sales cadence in Q3, it was very evenly paced over the period. When you take that day shift that we have of Halloween into Q4 into account, it was very consistent. So it's just the way the consumer is shopping. And it's up to us as retailers to ensure that we supply her with what she needs at the time she needs it. And that's how we look at the business.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of your question around margin, I'll start by saying we're very pleased with the quarter-to-date performance driving 33 basis points of expansion. It has been very broad-based utilizing many levers such as shrink, expense control around distribution, transportation. And we see opportunity to continue driving the favorability on those over the long term as well as leveraging the additional levers we mentioned earlier in category management, private label and foreign sourcing. We had mentioned previously that the rate of expansion would moderate as we go forward. Looking ahead to Q4, our guidance for Q4 is 8% operating profit growth, and we look at -- for the full year, I'm sorry, 8% for the full year. And we look to utilize all the levers within SG&A and operating and gross margin to get there. I should note that, that is the toughest lap of the year, Q4. And I should also note that we lap the anniversary of our cash back fee, which had been providing benefits year-to-date as well as the ramp-up of labor investment, which does put some pressure on that. But still very comfortable with the 8% full year operating profit growth guidance and our ability to continue to drive operating profit margin growth over time.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions. First, on the labor investments to get in-stocks up, you noted that you were seeing some benefits from the phase 1 stores. I was wondering if you could quantify a little bit more what that looked like. And just as a follow-on to that, I'm just curious if you're getting in-stocks up, I would think fairly quickly, once you add the labor in, why does it take a quarter or 2 to actually see it flow through to sales?\n\n---\n\nYes, Dan, how we see it is, first, the labor investments are paying off, and I have to give a lot of credit to our operators. They've done a very, very nice job in ensuring that the labor investments that we're making are very strategic in nature and they have a return. And in saying that, what we have seen, especially from the ones that we rolled in Q2, so the first initial wave, we're seeing increased sales at the rate -- actually, at an accelerated rate than we had first anticipated. And we're seeing great customer connection type scores, and again, how we measure our customer and how she looks at the business. So right now, we're very happy with that. And it does take a little time, though. As we roll this in, it takes some weeks for the customer to recognize that there's something different. Remember, our core consumer shops with us only, on average, about every 5 to 6 weeks. So it takes some time for her to come in and really notice the difference. But after a couple times coming in, she starts to see it. And as she sees that difference, we're seeing it on the sales line, and we're seeing it in her satisfaction scores.\n\n---\n\nThat's helpful. My other question was with regard to the tax rate. Last year, in the fourth quarter, I think you had a $0.03 benefit from a lower tax rate for a similar reason. So this year, is it an incremental $0.05 over last year? Or is it just, on an absolute basis, a $0.05 benefit?\n\n---\n\nIt is absolute $0.05, and last year was $0.04, just [indiscernible] incremental to last year.\n\n---\n\nAnd Dan, just to clarify, because I have gotten a lot of questions about that, that's always been in our guidance, and we do say that in our prepared remarks. And we said it, called it out earlier in the year as well. So...\n\n---\n\nThis is Esteban on for Matt. Todd, you commented about an event-driven, low-end consumer. Can you talk about what you saw specifically during Halloween and Thanksgiving and how you would rank your sales initiative we should consider as we head into next year?\n\n---\n\nSure. We -- our Halloween and harvest, and we rolled those 2 together, performed very well. As a matter of fact, both on the sales side and our sell-through exceeded last year by 90 basis points. So we feel very good about the events that we put together for that piece. And we put together a very strong program for Q4, of course, holiday. And we were very happy with our November overall sales. They came in right on our original forecast. And as we now move into December and into the balance of the quarter, we have a lot of shopping ahead of us still, but we feel very good about the plans we have, both in print and in digital as well as in-store. So we are very cautiously optimistic on how the holiday season will end up for us.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then on gross margin, where is your strength today versus historical levels? And what's the best way to think about some of the drivers of gross margin expansion that have helped this year versus areas for upside next year?\n\n---\n\nYes. So our shrink -- we don't usually talk about our shrink and the numbers, but I have to give credit to our store operators and our merchants. They've been working hand in hand now for well -- we always work on it, but well over a year on accelerated working on our shrink levels. And I'm very, very proud of the work that they've done. And those shrink levels continue to come down year-over-year. And shrink is one of the things that is never done. You're always working on shrink. But I have to say that our store operating team has a real good balanced approach to shrink to ensure that we use all of our technology tools and training to make sure that we can continue our shrink improvement as we go into 2016.\n\n---\n\nI'd like to go back to the topic of zero-based budgeting, which is certainly an expression I've heard thrown around. But I'd be interested in knowing how you're thinking about implementing it. What is the process that's involved?\n\n---\n\nSure. Great question. There's a couple key changes when you move to zero-based budgeting. And I'll say we've had great process rigor and discipline in place here that as you switch to zero-based budgeting, it really is a fundamental process change where you're doing a bottoms-up budget, making trade-offs, enforcing prioritization versus building a budget off of a prior year base. It's also a cost management change focused on dual ownership, where you have department -- traditional department budget owners as well as horizontal cost category experts who help drive increased scrutiny and resource allocation. And then also really driving ownership mind-set where we're putting our best resources against the best uses through the lens that Todd mentioned of what touches the customer, what's aligned with our strategic priorities while also mitigating against risk and making sure we're putting our money where we have the biggest returns. That's why they are the key differences, and we're well into that process of implementing that. The reduction in force was the first stage of that. Now on a go-forward basis, we're focused on driving costs out through indirect spending and continuing to drive a pipeline of savings to continue to drive down that SG&A leverage point and are doing it from a position of strength that positions us very well and solidifies our low cost position and competitive advantage.\n\n---\n\nAnd then if I could guess, I would be a devil's advocate or be a little bit of a cynic. It would seem that you want to lower your leverage point in part because you think that you won't hit the kind of comps you were hitting in the past and that you -- as the business growth slows or the business matures, you just need to lower your leverage point and lower your expenses. Is that too cynical of you?\n\n---\n\nMere, this is Todd. You've known me for a while. And I have to tell you that the way we're approaching this and because it's coming from a position of strength, our goal is to make sure that we can always offer the consumer the lowest price that she can get. And what better way to be able to do that than to pass the savings onto the consumer that we can save that is noncustomer-facing today. I can't think of a better way to do that. And that's our goal. Our goal is to be able to pass on the savings to the consumer, at the same time, by lowering our leverage point. So I think we can do both. I know we can do both. And again, you know Dollar General pretty well. We don't just usually throw things around. We implement them, and we execute them at the top of our game. And this will be no different.\n\n---\n\nThis is Andrew Ruben on for Vinny. I just wanted to ask, on the wage side, are you seeing any pressures from either rising minimum wages or from other retailers who are raising their wages and how that might flow through to your labor force?\n\n---\n\nToday, we monitor our wages across the United States as you can imagine. And what we're very proud of is that we pay a very, very competitive wage in all of the markets that we serve. In saying that, we continue to watch as wage pressures in some areas are on the rise. But I have to tell you that our operating team in hiring our hourly employees have done a fabulous job. And we are competitive where we need to be competitive. And we've seen virtually no difference today than we have in the past year. So we'll continue to watch that. But rest assured that we'll be in a position through all of our efforts here, including our cost containment that we talked about, to be able to reinvest wherever we need to, to be competitive.\n\n---\n\nGreat. That's helpful. And also, on the labor front, you talked about reduced store manager turnover and that leading to reduced associate turnover. Can you talk about some of the drivers behind that, whether it's related to perhaps higher pay? Or what some of the other drivers between the reduced turnover could be?\n\n---\n\nYes. The 2 things that are the most very important aspects of turnover and reason that people leave: number one, the relationship with their supervisor; and number two, workflow. And we're addressing both in what we're doing and then coupling that with training. So when you look at how we're approaching it and what we've done and already seeing some success is making sure that we have the right people in place at the district manager level. If you remember, we did some work many quarters ago to realign our districts to get them a little tighter so that they're in the stores more. And that has really helped with our store manager engagement. And as store managers feel better about their district managers, they stay longer. And if they stay longer, your store employees stay longer and happier. It is a cascading event. So it takes time. We can't wave a wand and have to exchange overnight. But I have to tell you, we've made significant progress in a very short period of time with a lot of initiatives yet to come in 2016 and beyond.\n\n---\n\nCongrats, John. Wanted to just touch-base on the top line. The -- a few-part question. First, just from a competitive standpoint, did you see any disruption in your third quarter results from Family Dollar's significant clearance efforts? Similarly, in the areas where they are rebannering, are you sensing that you're able to pick up share? Also, we've seen some better results out of the discount space with Walmart, with Target. And there is concern that perhaps with lower gas prices, they'll be able to feel more comfortable driving to those boxes and passing up a Dollar store along the way. Just any changes in those specific markets where you are directly competing with some of these competitors would be helpful.\n\n---\n\nYes, Paul, the quarter really showed a very tame pricing environment, to be very honest with you. No significant promotional activity above last year. And I'm happy to say that our price competitiveness is exactly the same as it has been against all channels of trade. So we're very happy with that. And we compete every day just like everyone does with a multitude of different retailers. And the great thing about Dollar General is we've got some fabulous category management process this year that continues to take advantage of every opportunity that may be out there. And I have to say that we saw nice store -- same-store sales growth in many categories, if not, as you've heard already, across all of our consumable and non-consumable areas. So we feel very confident about how we take this forward and about the mix and how we deliver same-store sales. And rest assured, we have a plethora of initiatives coming out for 2016.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And as we think about your new store model, perhaps you can just give us a little bit more detail about how you've refined the model. And then just as we think about your store rollout, over 900 stores next year, and expectations for that pace of growth to continue for a few years beyond that, is it necessary for you to go significantly into the urban and suburban markets in order for that to occur?\n\n---\n\nYes. So let me answer your first question, and we're very, very excited about our new store format that we'll be rolling out in 2016. We've tested many components, if not all components of it. We actually already have 4 stores up and running as we speak across different states to test the concept out. But as everything that we do here at Dollar General, we spent a lot of time on the front side with our consumers, seeing what she wanted in that new store. I'll just give you a couple little -- a little tidbits, and you'll hear more from us as we move into 2016. But the great thing about what we're able to deliver in this new format is a more convenient front end for our consumer. She's able to get in, get out quicker, have more product to buy at the front end and is easily navigated throughout the store right in the front end. It really opens up the front end of our stores. It expands our coolers from our current offering of about 16 doors up to 22 doors. And those extra doors will house anything from immediate consumption beverages to additional frozen dairy and perishable-type products. And we've done a lot of other work in health and beauty in our $1 offerings throughout the store in our seasonal areas. So more to come, but right now, it's in the early stages. But we're very, very encouraged in what we see by how that consumer is shopping that new format versus the old format. And then as I look to your other question, we're very, very, very happy with our real estate program and the way that our real estate folks execute on a quarterly basis to open as many stores as we open and, of course, remodel and relo as many as we do. In saying that, we have announced already that we will open 900 next year. So if you think about it, that's a lot of projects today. But more importantly, we don't see anything structurally that gets in the way of a 6% to 7% square footage growth rate as we go out into the outer years. In saying that, those opportunities are a nice fine balance of urban, suburban, if you will, and our rural locations. And that's the great thing about how we've set this up, is that as we continue to open stores in the outer years, it will continue to be a fine balance between those 2. And there's still plenty of opportunities in both urban areas and our metro suburban areas.\n\n---\n\nIn the seasonal category, your sales per foot slowed from about 2% over the last 2 quarters to closer to flat this quarter. I'm just wondering if you can talk to some of the reasons behind that.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think one of the biggest differences there is that one Halloween day that shifted in, when you factor that in, it was a little bit more normalized.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Any impact from weather in your mind, that maybe there's a different trend in some of the southern tier stores?\n\n---\n\nNo. Especially in our seasonal pieces, in our pure seasonal pieces, we didn't really see very much weather impact. Obviously, like others in some of our apparel categories, the warmer wet weather slowed some of our early apparels, but we're starting to see finally that cool weather starts to show up. And as it showed up, our apparel sales as well as our other cold weather sales items have increased nicely. So again, we're again cautiously optimistic on all of that as we move into Q4.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then lastly, the 10-Q points to some inventory growth in consumables, which I think is consistent with your efforts to improve in-stocks. But it also called out the home category as a source of inventory growth this quarter. Could you just talk to that change?\n\n---\n\nWhen you look at inventory, we had -- we did have a couple of those headwinds that you mentioned. In some of our non-consumable categories, the biggest shift probably was attributed to the import items that we had a very difficult time getting last year. As you remember, the port slowdown, which had been home and a lot of our non-consumable areas. And this year, products flowed as normal. And so when you look at it year-over-year, it gave us a little bit more inventory than we had last year. But quite frankly, a little bit more normalized that we used to see before that 2014 port slowdown that we were all dealing with.\n\n---\n\nAnd congratulations, John, as well. Todd, could you just maybe give a little bit of color on the level of inflation that you're seeing in your stores, particularly on the consumable side? We actually have seen deflation in categories like milk, for instance. Just curious as to whether this is having any impact at all on the comp performance.\n\n---\n\nWell, like most retailers, we haven't seen a lot of inflation. And as you indicated, some key commodity areas like fluid milks, some coffees, et cetera, we've seen some deflation. Those are big categories for us. So sure, that is a headwind for us in some of our food categories where that deflation has slowed our top line or out-the-door retail a little bit. But the great thing about Dollar General and how we look at the business is any time we can offer the consumer a lower price, it's best for her, and it gives her more money to spend elsewhere and hopefully in our stores. And so we look at it as an advantage as well, and we try to take good care of that consumer on our non-consumable goods, where she may have a little bit more money to spend during her trip.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just one follow-up for you on shrink. Sometimes when you hear retailers talk about focusing on shrink, it can come at the expense of sales. So can you talk just a little bit about the strategy itself, how you ensure that it doesn't come at the expense of sales and whether you've actually seen any of that at all?\n\n---\n\nWell, that's another very, very, very good question. And I sort of alluded to it a couple of minutes ago, it is a fine balance when you look at shrink, especially in our environment. And store managers, and I was one at one time, they tend to make sure that they protect the company's assets and their assets. So at times, that could be an issue, and we are no -- we're not immune to that. We're no different. We saw some of that. But the great thing is as we work on our on-shelf availability pieces, we're addressing those. But keep in mind, we also owe our stores tools to make sure that they feel comfortable in putting goods out. So we're rolling out more and more defensive merchandising tools so that we can keep product on the shelf for the consumer and yet have our store managers feel comfortable that it'll be there for sale for the consumer. So we're working both sides of that. And I think in the quarters to come with our efforts around on-shelf availability, it should only add to our in stocks, and it should also only add to our comp store sales.\n\n---\n\nTodd, so from 2010 through 2013, the company achieved an operating margin rate of -- I believe, it's like 9.9% to 10.3%. With the expense savings that you're poised to achieve, let's say, beginning next year, do you envision Dollar General operating margin rate returning to that level? Or if I understood your comments earlier, the expense savings that you do achieve, you would give back to the customer, I guess, the lower margin rate. And therefore, the operating margin probably remains about flat going forward.\n\n---\n\nDan, again, we haven't provided guidance obviously for 2016. But let me make sure that I do emphasize: It is our goal, first, to make sure that our consumer is taken care of, but also with an eye to our shareholders. So I would tell you that it'll be a very balanced approach with our zero-based budgeting activities, returning a portion of that back to our shareholders, but also reinvesting in our stores, whether it be price, whether it be labor in our stores, whatever that needs to be to be able to continue to drive our same-store sales at a very robust level. But stay tuned, more to come as we lay out our 2016 plans.\n\n---\n\nJust a second unrelated question, going back to your comments about your customer. So investors were anticipating the significant drop in gasoline prices potentially benefiting the value retailers. I guess, instead, there are some other categories that your customer shops, such as auto parts retailers that certainly did see a benefit. Maybe we got that wrong, but what happens if gasoline prices were -- begin to increase again? Will we be thinking about that as a headwind for the sector?\n\n---\n\nHow we look at the business is that we operate pretty consistently in high gas price or low gas price environments. When that price is high and she is strapped, we're a great alternative for her. And when it's lower and she may have a little bit more money, we're hoping that she spends it with us. But to your point, she seems to be spending this -- in this savings in gas prices a little differently. I think you almost look at it as she's sort of spending on deferred maintenance for her household. So -- and whether it be the automobile they didn't quite fix because they didn't have the money, or the refrigerator that they've been putting off buying for the last few years. Looks like she's spending money on that right now. But like everything is cyclical, it will come back around. And I believe that we'll be able to service our consumer in either one of those 2 environments on the energy price level.\n\n---\n\nCongrats, John, as well. But just on the inventories, a little bit more heavy than we're used to seeing. You cited the sales performance as a factor. I guess, how are you thinking about inventory levels by the end of the year? And as a tie-in to that question, when we look at your margin outlook for the fourth quarter, I think Michael asked this in his first question, what should we think about gross margins in the fourth quarter considering inventories are a little bit heavy?\n\n---\n\nSure. Our goal for inventory growth has been and always is to be -- keep it in line with sales growth over time. That doesn't happen every quarter, and this was one of those quarters. I'll start by saying our inventory is in great shape. If you look at of the increase, it was in consumables and core inventories. So no concerns there. And there's actions in place to reduce this. If you look at the third quarter, it was impacted, as we said, by on-shelf availability initiative as well as timing of receipts, which included imports as well as it was impacted by the sales performance. As we look ahead to Q4, there are some continued headwinds as we look at inventory projected levels there. We will be, again, lapping the West Coast port slowdown issue, which had inventory unusually low for imports this time last year -- in the fourth quarter last year. We also have an earlier Easter season, which will cause an earlier flow of inventory in the fourth quarter. And we will be stocking up to open our DC in San Antonio. So with the combination -- there are headwinds, which will impact our ability to get inventory all the way back in line with sales. But we do see that coming back in line over time and have actions in place to do so.\n\n---\n\nHelpful. And then anything on the gross margins for 4Q?\n\n---\n\nSure. As I mentioned before, in terms of gross margins, we look at gross margins and SG&A together in terms of hitting our goal, and we're very comfortable with the 8% guidance we provided. We'll work with both those levels. We're -- as we said before, we're going to deliver better performance this year than last year and the year before on overall operating margin, are very comfortable with hitting that number for Q4 and growing that going forward, leveraging the leverage we mentioned on gross margin as well as the strength of the zero-based budgeting actions we've taken will help us.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then just my last question is on the sales-driving initiatives, you alluded to expanding the number of cooler doors in new stores. Can you just remind us, is there a plan to go back to your existing fleet and also expand the number of doors where possible?\n\n---\n\nThat's another great question, Chuck. And yes, a matter of fact, we'll have a plan and have a plan in place for 2016 to go back to many of our legacy stores. This is very easily backwards compatible, if you will. And you'll see that in 2016 because it is a driver of our traffic and continues to be, so look forward to that in '16.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then if I could sneak one more in just [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nOne more.\n\n---\n\nSorry. If we reflect back to Rick's comments back in April about the consumer, he was particularly upbeat. And if you read the press release today, you've got some language in there, it's certainly a little bit more sobering. And just want to clarify that. Is that a reflection -- and I think you've alluded to this and answered it. But I just want to make sure that it's -- that you're okay with November sales, and you're not seeing anything that's just more of a reflection of the overall kind of macro consumer environment that we've seen over the past 60 days.\n\n---\n\nYes. Again, our November sales were right on our original plan or original forecast. So we feel very strong about November. And when you look at the overall comment, it is the environment that our consumer is in. Our consumer is always under pressure. I mean, she lives that way, but she's so resilient, and she figures it out. But she needs us to help her figure it out, and that's what we're here to do. She is facing a lot of headwinds, especially in rents. I mean, rents are up tremendously over the past few years. Our core consumer, our core, core consumer, nearly 50% of her take-home pay is going to rent today versus just a few short years ago, 37%. So you can see the headwind that she's gotten. And quite frankly, not a lot of wage growth for her. So there's a lot of other pressures that the core consumer has, but we feel very good about our offering and how we service that consumer. And I think we've shown it over the years, and the consumer is voting by coming to the Dollar General.\n\n---\n\nSo operator, that will wrap up our call today. I just want to say thank you to everyone for joining our call. Please stay tuned for a save the date for our Investor Day, as Todd mentioned, on March 23 and 24, and we'll look forward to seeing everyone then. And thank you for your interest in Dollar General.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nCongrats, John. So Todd, between your discussion of zero-based budgeting, being the low-cost operator, capturing profitable growth, what do you think the right comp rate is in order to generate leverage in the business if it's not 3.5%? And how do you get there in a world where consumables are growing faster than discretionary and putting pressure on your gross margin and you've based the potential of wage pressure over the long term?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes. Michael, the way we see the business is, first of all, we have a very robust category management process here. And that process that we implemented well over 7 years ago has served us very well in being able to balance that consumable and non-consumable mix. While consumables continue to dominate our sales, I have to say that I'm very proud of where our non-consumable business has come. We never lost sight of our non-consumable businesses even through some of the real harsh times our consumer was going through back in 2009, '10 and coming out of that Great Recession that we had, and that continues now. We've had a nice string of consecutive quarters that our non-consumable businesses had been pretty strong. And then as you look at being that low-cost operator, we are committed to that. And I have to say, a little bit more to come as we get into 2016 on that. But I can tell you that it is our goal to ensure that, that leverage ratio comes down off of that 3.5%, and we'll be able to leverage our expenses at a much lower rate than it currently is.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nOkay. And my follow-up question is really in 2 parts. First, on the margin outlook for the fourth quarter, if -- to get to the midpoint of the range, it looks like you're going to have to assume 50 basis points or so of margin degradation. Is that right? And where is that coming from? And then could you clarify what you mean by consumers are shopping closer to events? Does that mean that it could start off a little volatile and you're still expecting trends to pick up as we get closer to Christmas?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, sure, Mike. Well, let me answer the -- your second question first, and I'll pass it over to John to talk to gross margin with you. As we see it, our core consumer, because she is always very cash-strapped, she does shop closer to the event. So whether it'd be 4th of July during the summer, whether it'd be Halloween in the fall or even holiday time around Christmas, she tends to shop heavier in the days leading into those holidays. Now she's always been that way, but we've seen it get a little bit closer to the holiday each and every year now for the last few years. And when you really look at our sales cadence in Q3, it was very evenly paced over the period. When you take that day shift that we have of Halloween into Q4 into account, it was very consistent. So it's just the way the consumer is shopping. And it's up to us as retailers to ensure that we supply her with what she needs at the time she needs it. And that's how we look at the business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Garratt (Executives)】\nIn terms of your question around margin, I'll start by saying we're very pleased with the quarter-to-date performance driving 33 basis points of expansion. It has been very broad-based utilizing many levers such as shrink, expense control around distribution, transportation. And we see opportunity to continue driving the favorability on those over the long term as well as leveraging the additional levers we mentioned earlier in category management, private label and foreign sourcing. We had mentioned previously that the rate of expansion would moderate as we go forward. Looking ahead to Q4, our guidance for Q4 is 8% operating profit growth, and we look at -- for the full year, I'm sorry, 8% for the full year. And we look to utilize all the levers within SG&A and operating and gross margin to get there. I should note that, that is the toughest lap of the year, Q4. And I should also note that we lap the anniversary of our cash back fee, which had been providing benefits year-to-date as well as the ramp-up of labor investment, which does put some pressure on that. But still very comfortable with the 8% full year operating profit growth guidance and our ability to continue to drive operating profit margin growth over time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions. First, on the labor investments to get in-stocks up, you noted that you were seeing some benefits from the phase 1 stores. I was wondering if you could quantify a little bit more what that looked like. And just as a follow-on to that, I'm just curious if you're getting in-stocks up, I would think fairly quickly, once you add the labor in, why does it take a quarter or 2 to actually see it flow through to sales?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, Dan, how we see it is, first, the labor investments are paying off, and I have to give a lot of credit to our operators. They've done a very, very nice job in ensuring that the labor investments that we're making are very strategic in nature and they have a return. And in saying that, what we have seen, especially from the ones that we rolled in Q2, so the first initial wave, we're seeing increased sales at the rate -- actually, at an accelerated rate than we had first anticipated. And we're seeing great customer connection type scores, and again, how we measure our customer and how she looks at the business. So right now, we're very happy with that. And it does take a little time, though. As we roll this in, it takes some weeks for the customer to recognize that there's something different. Remember, our core consumer shops with us only, on average, about every 5 to 6 weeks. So it takes some time for her to come in and really notice the difference. But after a couple times coming in, she starts to see it. And as she sees that difference, we're seeing it on the sales line, and we're seeing it in her satisfaction scores.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nThat's helpful. My other question was with regard to the tax rate. Last year, in the fourth quarter, I think you had a $0.03 benefit from a lower tax rate for a similar reason. So this year, is it an incremental $0.05 over last year? Or is it just, on an absolute basis, a $0.05 benefit?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Garratt (Executives)】\nIt is absolute $0.05, and last year was $0.04, just [indiscernible] incremental to last year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nAnd Dan, just to clarify, because I have gotten a lot of questions about that, that's always been in our guidance, and we do say that in our prepared remarks. And we said it, called it out earlier in the year as well. So...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Esteban Gomez (Analysts)】\nThis is Esteban on for Matt. Todd, you commented about an event-driven, low-end consumer. Can you talk about what you saw specifically during Halloween and Thanksgiving and how you would rank your sales initiative we should consider as we head into next year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nSure. We -- our Halloween and harvest, and we rolled those 2 together, performed very well. As a matter of fact, both on the sales side and our sell-through exceeded last year by 90 basis points. So we feel very good about the events that we put together for that piece. And we put together a very strong program for Q4, of course, holiday. And we were very happy with our November overall sales. They came in right on our original forecast. And as we now move into December and into the balance of the quarter, we have a lot of shopping ahead of us still, but we feel very good about the plans we have, both in print and in digital as well as in-store. So we are very cautiously optimistic on how the holiday season will end up for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Esteban Gomez (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then on gross margin, where is your strength today versus historical levels? And what's the best way to think about some of the drivers of gross margin expansion that have helped this year versus areas for upside next year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes. So our shrink -- we don't usually talk about our shrink and the numbers, but I have to give credit to our store operators and our merchants. They've been working hand in hand now for well -- we always work on it, but well over a year on accelerated working on our shrink levels. And I'm very, very proud of the work that they've done. And those shrink levels continue to come down year-over-year. And shrink is one of the things that is never done. You're always working on shrink. But I have to say that our store operating team has a real good balanced approach to shrink to ensure that we use all of our technology tools and training to make sure that we can continue our shrink improvement as we go into 2016.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nI'd like to go back to the topic of zero-based budgeting, which is certainly an expression I've heard thrown around. But I'd be interested in knowing how you're thinking about implementing it. What is the process that's involved?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Garratt (Executives)】\nSure. Great question. There's a couple key changes when you move to zero-based budgeting. And I'll say we've had great process rigor and discipline in place here that as you switch to zero-based budgeting, it really is a fundamental process change where you're doing a bottoms-up budget, making trade-offs, enforcing prioritization versus building a budget off of a prior year base. It's also a cost management change focused on dual ownership, where you have department -- traditional department budget owners as well as horizontal cost category experts who help drive increased scrutiny and resource allocation. And then also really driving ownership mind-set where we're putting our best resources against the best uses through the lens that Todd mentioned of what touches the customer, what's aligned with our strategic priorities while also mitigating against risk and making sure we're putting our money where we have the biggest returns. That's why they are the key differences, and we're well into that process of implementing that. The reduction in force was the first stage of that. Now on a go-forward basis, we're focused on driving costs out through indirect spending and continuing to drive a pipeline of savings to continue to drive down that SG&A leverage point and are doing it from a position of strength that positions us very well and solidifies our low cost position and competitive advantage.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nAnd then if I could guess, I would be a devil's advocate or be a little bit of a cynic. It would seem that you want to lower your leverage point in part because you think that you won't hit the kind of comps you were hitting in the past and that you -- as the business growth slows or the business matures, you just need to lower your leverage point and lower your expenses. Is that too cynical of you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nMere, this is Todd. You've known me for a while. And I have to tell you that the way we're approaching this and because it's coming from a position of strength, our goal is to make sure that we can always offer the consumer the lowest price that she can get. And what better way to be able to do that than to pass the savings onto the consumer that we can save that is noncustomer-facing today. I can't think of a better way to do that. And that's our goal. Our goal is to be able to pass on the savings to the consumer, at the same time, by lowering our leverage point. So I think we can do both. I know we can do both. And again, you know Dollar General pretty well. We don't just usually throw things around. We implement them, and we execute them at the top of our game. And this will be no different.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Ruben (Analysts)】\nThis is Andrew Ruben on for Vinny. I just wanted to ask, on the wage side, are you seeing any pressures from either rising minimum wages or from other retailers who are raising their wages and how that might flow through to your labor force?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nToday, we monitor our wages across the United States as you can imagine. And what we're very proud of is that we pay a very, very competitive wage in all of the markets that we serve. In saying that, we continue to watch as wage pressures in some areas are on the rise. But I have to tell you that our operating team in hiring our hourly employees have done a fabulous job. And we are competitive where we need to be competitive. And we've seen virtually no difference today than we have in the past year. So we'll continue to watch that. But rest assured that we'll be in a position through all of our efforts here, including our cost containment that we talked about, to be able to reinvest wherever we need to, to be competitive.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Ruben (Analysts)】\nGreat. That's helpful. And also, on the labor front, you talked about reduced store manager turnover and that leading to reduced associate turnover. Can you talk about some of the drivers behind that, whether it's related to perhaps higher pay? Or what some of the other drivers between the reduced turnover could be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes. The 2 things that are the most very important aspects of turnover and reason that people leave: number one, the relationship with their supervisor; and number two, workflow. And we're addressing both in what we're doing and then coupling that with training. So when you look at how we're approaching it and what we've done and already seeing some success is making sure that we have the right people in place at the district manager level. If you remember, we did some work many quarters ago to realign our districts to get them a little tighter so that they're in the stores more. And that has really helped with our store manager engagement. And as store managers feel better about their district managers, they stay longer. And if they stay longer, your store employees stay longer and happier. It is a cascading event. So it takes time. We can't wave a wand and have to exchange overnight. But I have to tell you, we've made significant progress in a very short period of time with a lot of initiatives yet to come in 2016 and beyond.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nCongrats, John. Wanted to just touch-base on the top line. The -- a few-part question. First, just from a competitive standpoint, did you see any disruption in your third quarter results from Family Dollar's significant clearance efforts? Similarly, in the areas where they are rebannering, are you sensing that you're able to pick up share? Also, we've seen some better results out of the discount space with Walmart, with Target. And there is concern that perhaps with lower gas prices, they'll be able to feel more comfortable driving to those boxes and passing up a Dollar store along the way. Just any changes in those specific markets where you are directly competing with some of these competitors would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, Paul, the quarter really showed a very tame pricing environment, to be very honest with you. No significant promotional activity above last year. And I'm happy to say that our price competitiveness is exactly the same as it has been against all channels of trade. So we're very happy with that. And we compete every day just like everyone does with a multitude of different retailers. And the great thing about Dollar General is we've got some fabulous category management process this year that continues to take advantage of every opportunity that may be out there. And I have to say that we saw nice store -- same-store sales growth in many categories, if not, as you've heard already, across all of our consumable and non-consumable areas. So we feel very confident about how we take this forward and about the mix and how we deliver same-store sales. And rest assured, we have a plethora of initiatives coming out for 2016.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nGot it. And as we think about your new store model, perhaps you can just give us a little bit more detail about how you've refined the model. And then just as we think about your store rollout, over 900 stores next year, and expectations for that pace of growth to continue for a few years beyond that, is it necessary for you to go significantly into the urban and suburban markets in order for that to occur?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes. So let me answer your first question, and we're very, very excited about our new store format that we'll be rolling out in 2016. We've tested many components, if not all components of it. We actually already have 4 stores up and running as we speak across different states to test the concept out. But as everything that we do here at Dollar General, we spent a lot of time on the front side with our consumers, seeing what she wanted in that new store. I'll just give you a couple little -- a little tidbits, and you'll hear more from us as we move into 2016. But the great thing about what we're able to deliver in this new format is a more convenient front end for our consumer. She's able to get in, get out quicker, have more product to buy at the front end and is easily navigated throughout the store right in the front end. It really opens up the front end of our stores. It expands our coolers from our current offering of about 16 doors up to 22 doors. And those extra doors will house anything from immediate consumption beverages to additional frozen dairy and perishable-type products. And we've done a lot of other work in health and beauty in our $1 offerings throughout the store in our seasonal areas. So more to come, but right now, it's in the early stages. But we're very, very encouraged in what we see by how that consumer is shopping that new format versus the old format. And then as I look to your other question, we're very, very, very happy with our real estate program and the way that our real estate folks execute on a quarterly basis to open as many stores as we open and, of course, remodel and relo as many as we do. In saying that, we have announced already that we will open 900 next year. So if you think about it, that's a lot of projects today. But more importantly, we don't see anything structurally that gets in the way of a 6% to 7% square footage growth rate as we go out into the outer years. In saying that, those opportunities are a nice fine balance of urban, suburban, if you will, and our rural locations. And that's the great thing about how we've set this up, is that as we continue to open stores in the outer years, it will continue to be a fine balance between those 2. And there's still plenty of opportunities in both urban areas and our metro suburban areas.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nIn the seasonal category, your sales per foot slowed from about 2% over the last 2 quarters to closer to flat this quarter. I'm just wondering if you can talk to some of the reasons behind that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, I think one of the biggest differences there is that one Halloween day that shifted in, when you factor that in, it was a little bit more normalized.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nOkay. Any impact from weather in your mind, that maybe there's a different trend in some of the southern tier stores?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nNo. Especially in our seasonal pieces, in our pure seasonal pieces, we didn't really see very much weather impact. Obviously, like others in some of our apparel categories, the warmer wet weather slowed some of our early apparels, but we're starting to see finally that cool weather starts to show up. And as it showed up, our apparel sales as well as our other cold weather sales items have increased nicely. So again, we're again cautiously optimistic on all of that as we move into Q4.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then lastly, the 10-Q points to some inventory growth in consumables, which I think is consistent with your efforts to improve in-stocks. But it also called out the home category as a source of inventory growth this quarter. Could you just talk to that change?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nWhen you look at inventory, we had -- we did have a couple of those headwinds that you mentioned. In some of our non-consumable categories, the biggest shift probably was attributed to the import items that we had a very difficult time getting last year. As you remember, the port slowdown, which had been home and a lot of our non-consumable areas. And this year, products flowed as normal. And so when you look at it year-over-year, it gave us a little bit more inventory than we had last year. But quite frankly, a little bit more normalized that we used to see before that 2014 port slowdown that we were all dealing with.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nAnd congratulations, John, as well. Todd, could you just maybe give a little bit of color on the level of inflation that you're seeing in your stores, particularly on the consumable side? We actually have seen deflation in categories like milk, for instance. Just curious as to whether this is having any impact at all on the comp performance.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nWell, like most retailers, we haven't seen a lot of inflation. And as you indicated, some key commodity areas like fluid milks, some coffees, et cetera, we've seen some deflation. Those are big categories for us. So sure, that is a headwind for us in some of our food categories where that deflation has slowed our top line or out-the-door retail a little bit. But the great thing about Dollar General and how we look at the business is any time we can offer the consumer a lower price, it's best for her, and it gives her more money to spend elsewhere and hopefully in our stores. And so we look at it as an advantage as well, and we try to take good care of that consumer on our non-consumable goods, where she may have a little bit more money to spend during her trip.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nAnd then just one follow-up for you on shrink. Sometimes when you hear retailers talk about focusing on shrink, it can come at the expense of sales. So can you talk just a little bit about the strategy itself, how you ensure that it doesn't come at the expense of sales and whether you've actually seen any of that at all?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nWell, that's another very, very, very good question. And I sort of alluded to it a couple of minutes ago, it is a fine balance when you look at shrink, especially in our environment. And store managers, and I was one at one time, they tend to make sure that they protect the company's assets and their assets. So at times, that could be an issue, and we are no -- we're not immune to that. We're no different. We saw some of that. But the great thing is as we work on our on-shelf availability pieces, we're addressing those. But keep in mind, we also owe our stores tools to make sure that they feel comfortable in putting goods out. So we're rolling out more and more defensive merchandising tools so that we can keep product on the shelf for the consumer and yet have our store managers feel comfortable that it'll be there for sale for the consumer. So we're working both sides of that. And I think in the quarters to come with our efforts around on-shelf availability, it should only add to our in stocks, and it should also only add to our comp store sales.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nTodd, so from 2010 through 2013, the company achieved an operating margin rate of -- I believe, it's like 9.9% to 10.3%. With the expense savings that you're poised to achieve, let's say, beginning next year, do you envision Dollar General operating margin rate returning to that level? Or if I understood your comments earlier, the expense savings that you do achieve, you would give back to the customer, I guess, the lower margin rate. And therefore, the operating margin probably remains about flat going forward.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nDan, again, we haven't provided guidance obviously for 2016. But let me make sure that I do emphasize: It is our goal, first, to make sure that our consumer is taken care of, but also with an eye to our shareholders. So I would tell you that it'll be a very balanced approach with our zero-based budgeting activities, returning a portion of that back to our shareholders, but also reinvesting in our stores, whether it be price, whether it be labor in our stores, whatever that needs to be to be able to continue to drive our same-store sales at a very robust level. But stay tuned, more to come as we lay out our 2016 plans.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nJust a second unrelated question, going back to your comments about your customer. So investors were anticipating the significant drop in gasoline prices potentially benefiting the value retailers. I guess, instead, there are some other categories that your customer shops, such as auto parts retailers that certainly did see a benefit. Maybe we got that wrong, but what happens if gasoline prices were -- begin to increase again? Will we be thinking about that as a headwind for the sector?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nHow we look at the business is that we operate pretty consistently in high gas price or low gas price environments. When that price is high and she is strapped, we're a great alternative for her. And when it's lower and she may have a little bit more money, we're hoping that she spends it with us. But to your point, she seems to be spending this -- in this savings in gas prices a little differently. I think you almost look at it as she's sort of spending on deferred maintenance for her household. So -- and whether it be the automobile they didn't quite fix because they didn't have the money, or the refrigerator that they've been putting off buying for the last few years. Looks like she's spending money on that right now. But like everything is cyclical, it will come back around. And I believe that we'll be able to service our consumer in either one of those 2 environments on the energy price level.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nCongrats, John, as well. But just on the inventories, a little bit more heavy than we're used to seeing. You cited the sales performance as a factor. I guess, how are you thinking about inventory levels by the end of the year? And as a tie-in to that question, when we look at your margin outlook for the fourth quarter, I think Michael asked this in his first question, what should we think about gross margins in the fourth quarter considering inventories are a little bit heavy?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Garratt (Executives)】\nSure. Our goal for inventory growth has been and always is to be -- keep it in line with sales growth over time. That doesn't happen every quarter, and this was one of those quarters. I'll start by saying our inventory is in great shape. If you look at of the increase, it was in consumables and core inventories. So no concerns there. And there's actions in place to reduce this. If you look at the third quarter, it was impacted, as we said, by on-shelf availability initiative as well as timing of receipts, which included imports as well as it was impacted by the sales performance. As we look ahead to Q4, there are some continued headwinds as we look at inventory projected levels there. We will be, again, lapping the West Coast port slowdown issue, which had inventory unusually low for imports this time last year -- in the fourth quarter last year. We also have an earlier Easter season, which will cause an earlier flow of inventory in the fourth quarter. And we will be stocking up to open our DC in San Antonio. So with the combination -- there are headwinds, which will impact our ability to get inventory all the way back in line with sales. But we do see that coming back in line over time and have actions in place to do so.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nHelpful. And then anything on the gross margins for 4Q?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Garratt (Executives)】\nSure. As I mentioned before, in terms of gross margins, we look at gross margins and SG&A together in terms of hitting our goal, and we're very comfortable with the 8% guidance we provided. We'll work with both those levels. We're -- as we said before, we're going to deliver better performance this year than last year and the year before on overall operating margin, are very comfortable with hitting that number for Q4 and growing that going forward, leveraging the leverage we mentioned on gross margin as well as the strength of the zero-based budgeting actions we've taken will help us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then just my last question is on the sales-driving initiatives, you alluded to expanding the number of cooler doors in new stores. Can you just remind us, is there a plan to go back to your existing fleet and also expand the number of doors where possible?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nThat's another great question, Chuck. And yes, a matter of fact, we'll have a plan and have a plan in place for 2016 to go back to many of our legacy stores. This is very easily backwards compatible, if you will. And you'll see that in 2016 because it is a driver of our traffic and continues to be, so look forward to that in '16.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then if I could sneak one more in just [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nOne more.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nSorry. If we reflect back to Rick's comments back in April about the consumer, he was particularly upbeat. And if you read the press release today, you've got some language in there, it's certainly a little bit more sobering. And just want to clarify that. Is that a reflection -- and I think you've alluded to this and answered it. But I just want to make sure that it's -- that you're okay with November sales, and you're not seeing anything that's just more of a reflection of the overall kind of macro consumer environment that we've seen over the past 60 days.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes. Again, our November sales were right on our original plan or original forecast. So we feel very strong about November. And when you look at the overall comment, it is the environment that our consumer is in. Our consumer is always under pressure. I mean, she lives that way, but she's so resilient, and she figures it out. But she needs us to help her figure it out, and that's what we're here to do. She is facing a lot of headwinds, especially in rents. I mean, rents are up tremendously over the past few years. Our core consumer, our core, core consumer, nearly 50% of her take-home pay is going to rent today versus just a few short years ago, 37%. So you can see the headwind that she's gotten. And quite frankly, not a lot of wage growth for her. So there's a lot of other pressures that the core consumer has, but we feel very good about our offering and how we service that consumer. And I think we've shown it over the years, and the consumer is voting by coming to the Dollar General.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nSo operator, that will wrap up our call today. I just want to say thank you to everyone for joining our call. Please stay tuned for a save the date for our Investor Day, as Todd mentioned, on March 23 and 24, and we'll look forward to seeing everyone then. And thank you for your interest in Dollar General.",

And for those of you who are on the teleconference, we just started with a brief video that featured real Sage customers. Everyone on that video is a customer. So our business is all about entrepreneurs and championing small and medium businesses around the world, who are the powerhouse of every economy.\r\nSo before we get started, I want to give you a quick overview of the agenda for this morning's presentation. I'll provide a brief summary of the performance of my first year. And then I'll hand over to Steve Hare to take you through the numbers. Then I'll come back and update you on the execution progress of the transformation we outlined at Capital Markets Day in June and close with our outlook for FY '16.\r\nPlease note the safe harbor statement on my left, which you can see in your packs and also on our website.\r\nSo when I joined Sage, I was very excited, as I told you last year. For me, this is a great fit, the combination of my experience in technology and my passion for entrepreneurship. After my first year, I have to say I'm even more excited. I've looked under the covers at U.K.'s greatest and largest and most successful technology company over the years and seen huge potential to create something very special for all our stakeholders.\r\nAt CMD, we outlined the steps that we're taking to transform the business, and we committed that we would maintain our financial performance through the transformation period. We've exceeded the financial targets, and this represents the fastest rate of growth for 8 years, but we certainly don't want to get ahead of ourselves as this management team is early in its tenure. We've opened a new chapter for Sage on the journey for high-quality, sustainable growth and can share with you today some of the early signs.\r\nSo the transformation is already underway. Yes, it will take time, and it may be nonlinear with inherent operational risks. FY '16 is a pivotal year for us, but we're building and have built an experienced team and have a balanced and sequenced approach to ensure our success. We're building momentum and starting to see the first green shoots of progress. I'll come back to talk to these after Steve. We're very reassured by the resilient business model that we have in place, and we mean to continue to deliver financially as we transform.\r\nSo I'd like to pass now to Steve, who will talk you through the highlights of the numbers. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Stephen, and morning, everyone. So 2 main parts to the presentation today. As usual, I'll talk through the results for FY '15, but first, I'm going to explain the changes that we've made in terms of how we record revenue in order to give improved clarity and transparency and also give you the context of why we've made these changes.\r\nThis slide shows our results on the same basis as we've previously reported in order to give a clear like-for-like comparison. The headline is we've achieved our targets. These results are in line with what we presented at the half year, and the momentum in both recurring revenue and subscription revenue has continued. \r\nThis slide shows the side-by-side reported results against the results using the prior basis to give full transparency of the changes. So why make these changes now? We have completed a comprehensive root and branch review of this business. This has included organization, people, process, internal systems, policies; and we want to make sure that we have the capability to scale the business. Partsof this is reviewing the reporting to ensure that it is consistent with the new business and operating model. Stephen and I wanted to make sure that we had a crystal-clear starting point for the next phase that helps all of our stakeholders clearly understand the underlying commercial transactions. We've consulted with our auditors and with the FRC to ensure that we have the best available advice before reaching our conclusions. Just to be clear, these changes have no impact on cash. The only change is how we record revenue.\r\nSo I'll talk you through the 3 changes and show you the impact. The first impact is to change how we account for upfront payments on a number of accounting and payroll products. This involves reclassifying GBP 55 million into recurring revenue and deferring GBP 3 million into FY '16, therefore reducing SSRS by GBP 58 million. As I will illustrate, this change in definition is driven by the evolution of how we sell and how the customer consumes our products.\r\nThe history was to sell an on-premise product for both accounting and payroll with a separate perpetual license, with an optional maintenance and support contract. The accounting for this is very clear. We recognize the license at the point of delivery and the M&S over the life of the contract. Upgrades would also be recognized at the point of delivery. Our aim is to encourage customers to move to subscription and, as a result, to have one single payment covering a bundled offering. If the customer ceases to pay, then they can't use the product or the service. Again, the accounting for this is very straightforward, with revenue recognized over the life of the contract.\r\nAs part of our Customer for Life strategy, we want to ensure that customers can receive the benefit of a bundled offering while still retaining their on-premise product and deriving value from their perpetual license if that's what they choose. Reacting to this, in the middle of this slide, we illustrate how we've started to sell contracts that have many of the features of a subscription contract but the software is still on a separate license. However, that license is increasingly bundled into the maintenance and support offering, much more so than in the past.\r\nI want to illustrate with 2 examples. The first is Sage 200 in the U.K. & Ireland. We now sell an annual license key to use the software rather than a perpetual license, and this also requires a concurrent M&S contract. The product is connected, and the product will turn off without the validation of a valid license key. This is essentially the same as subscription. Historically, we would have recognized the revenue on the upfront license at the point of delivery, whereas now it will be accounted for as subscription, i.e. over the life of the contract, as this reflects the integrated nature of the offering and how the product is being consumed.\r\nThe second example is Sage 50 Payroll. A perpetual license is actually still sold rather than a license key. However, to maintain the functionality, for example, the updated tax tables, the customer needs to have a current maintenance and support contract. Legally, the product can still be used without an M&S contract, but it doesn't function as intended because the tax tables are not updated. Now this is not subscription. However, it is a bundled contract for the products to work as intended. And therefore, I think it's more appropriate that the upfront payment for the license is now recognized as being integrated and is therefore recognized over the life of the contract rather than being recognized upfront.\r\nThe next change relates to referral commissions paid to independent sales organizations in our North American payments business. Historically, Sage treated the ISOs as a business partner and deducted these commissions from revenue and therefore showed revenue net. I think it's more transparent and more appropriate to show the revenue gross and to treat the referral commission as a cost. The impact is to increase revenue in the year by GBP 46 million and increase the costs by the same amount. There is therefore no impact on absolute profit. However, because we have no revenue -- sorry, because we have revenue with no corresponding increase in profit, the operating margin percentage reduces. This slide illustrates why I think the grossing up is a more appropriate approach. The contractual relationship is between Sage and the end customer. The ISO is not involved in the ongoing relationship. This is very different from, say, a business partner on Sage 300, where the business partner will usually act as a reseller and therefore the business partner is a customer of Sage.\r\nThe final change is to create a new category of revenue called payment processing. Previously, this revenue was included within recurring revenue. And it provides greater transparency to show processing revenue, which is volume driven, separate from software-related recurring revenue.\r\nSo this next slide summarizes and brings together all of the changes. The recurring revenue is impacted by the reclassification from SSRS. The gross-up of referral commissions is included in the line but then gets transferred to processing revenue, i.e. it's part of the GBP 158 million in the next column. Processing revenue is as I've explained and is mainly payment processing, although there is a small amount of payroll outsourcing included. SSRS revenue reduces due to the upfront payments being deferred. The revenue in FY '15 increases by GBP 43 million due to the ISO gross-up of GBP 46 million, which will obviously continue through into future years. And there is a small deferral of GBP 3 million into FY '16.\r\nSo having explained the changes and summarized the impact, I now show all the information on a revised basis, as presented in the annual report and accounts. And as you can see, the impact has to reduce the overall revenue growth to 6% but to increase the recurring revenue slightly to 9%. As previously mentioned, the operating profit is only slightly impacted due to the deferral of the GBP 3 million of revenue. However, the margin percentage reduces more because of the revenue gross-up of the ISO referral commissions.\r\nTo summarize, I believe these changes improve transparency and are consistent with the review of the business that we've undertaken. Going forward, as we accelerate the switch to subscription, we will also look to simplify how we sell to our customers, and this, in turn, will simplify our revenue recognition further.\r\nOrganic revenue growth excludes the acquisitions of Exact and PayChoice, which add GBP 35 million of revenue. These will be included as organic in FY '16. We have chosen not to create any exceptional items this year, but it is worth noting that we've absorbed around GBP 20 million of unplanned investments which will benefit future periods. GBP 15 million of this cost was included in G&A, and GBP 5 million in sales and marketing.\r\nMoving through from operating profit. We had an interest charge of GBP 21 million, which is flat year-on-year; tax of GBP 90 million, which is a reduction in the effective tax rate to 25% which has been driven by a lower rate in the U.K.; and some benefits from prior-year tax planning. I would expect 25% to be at the lower end of the range going forward because I think some of the tax planning will be difficult to sustain. And so I would guide to a range of 25% to 27%, with it being more towards the upper end in the medium term. On a statutory basis, we've taken a goodwill impairment charge of GBP 62 million relating to Brazil given the difficult economic conditions in that country and a more cautious outlook. However, our long-term confidence remains, and achieving 9% recurring revenue growth was a good result.\r\nWe've also achieved EPS growth of 12.6% due to the lower tax rate and some share buybacks earlier in the year. Some U.S. investors have asked us to show depreciation and amortization separately, along with the share-based payment charge, in order to aid comparison with our competitors, and so I include it on this slide. And finally, we announced an 8% increase in dividend, in line with our progressive dividend policy.\r\nI'll now move on to some of the group's cash metrics. Our underlying cash conversion remained strong at 106%, up from 101% last year. Free cash flow of GBP 296 million represents 21% of revenue. The closing net debt is around 1x EBITDA. And just pulling a couple of the numbers out: The M&A relates to PayChoice, which was completed in October 2014. And as I mentioned, the buyback of shares was completed in the early part of the year.\r\nSo I'd now like to look at the revenue categories. As I've already mentioned, we achieved a 6% overall revenue growth driven by a 9% increase in recurring revenue, which, in turn, was driven by a 29% increase in software subscription. We now have over 690,000 software subscription contracts.\r\nI'll call out some strong performance and areas of focus in the regions in later slides, but we are seeing offerings like Sage 50 lead the way in incentivizing customers to move from maintenance and support to subscription. In turn, M&S growth and, therefore, the other recurring revenue category on this slide, is relatively flat. We now have 173,000 subscribers globally on Sage One and have announced that in the U.K. we have surpassed 100,000 subscribers. The revenue is now running at just over GBP 1 million a month.\r\nProcessing revenue is the new category, and this is principally the payments business. 2% growth is not where we want to be, but in recent months, we've seen some new account additions starting to accelerate in North America. And Sage Pay's growth has been much more encouraging. \r\nDecline in SSRS is a consequence of our strategy and, as we've previously called out, will vary depending on the pace of transition and the level of license sales, particularly on products like X3 where subscription adoption is slower.\r\nAt the Capital Markets Day, we shared the new product classifications Growth and Heritage. A year ago, we had 67% of R&D focused on Invest products, which was the old category. We now have 87% of R&D on Growth products and over 90% of sales and marketing. This focus has meant that all of the revenue growth is now coming from Growth products. Initiatives such as core product modernization, including cloud versions of our on-premise products, is really beginning to pay off. And we are seeing collaboration across borders on products like Sage Drive.\r\nOur growth in annualized subscriber base has been and will remain one of our leading measures. There's a number of strong offerings which have seen the number of subscribers grow to over 690,000. Between Sage 50 Accounts and Sage 50 Payroll in the U.K. & Ireland, innovations such as Sage Drive and monetizing enhanced functionality from pension auto-enrollment added GBP 19 million. Sage 50 accounts in the U.S. and Canada contributed GBP 14 million, with Sage Drive being launched in Canada where we saw a fivefold increase in subscription. Sage Drive will be launched in the U.S. this half. The i7 upgrade to SMB payroll in France added GBP 14 million. It's important to note that whilst the strategy is working, this is principally driven by enhanced functionality. In previous periods, we've called out that half our growth has come from price. In this period, it's more like 1/3. On-premise products -- on-premise customers are choosing to substitute their M&S contracts for a more integrated subscription offering. Of our Sage 50 customers who are required to comply with the pension regulation, 58% took up the auto-enrollment option. For i7 payroll in France, 78% of eligible customers have taken up those offerings.\r\nTo maintain growth, we aim to mirror these initiatives on other products, although many smaller businesses in the U.K., actually around 80% by volume, have not yet been required to comply with the pension auto-enrollment.\r\nSage One appears on this chart for the first time and has added GBP 4 million to the growth in ASB. As I mentioned earlier, Sage One now has a run rate of just over GBP 1 million of revenue per month.\r\nMoving now to the regions. This year, we present the International region for the first time. This region effectively is everywhere outside of North America and Europe and is the old AAMEA region plus Brazil. We've taken the opportunity to group these countries together to maximize their similar high-growth economies and the associated white space opportunity.\r\nSo now taking each region in turn and starting with Europe. Overall growth in Europe was 5%, with recurring revenue growth of 8%, but it is worth noting that 75% of revenue in Europe now is recurring. Processing revenue growth of 9% driven by Sage Pay is encouraging, and we've had some good progress integrating Sage Pay into our products in the U.K. & Ireland. \r\nThe highlights are noted on the slide, but I would like to emphasize a few of them. A 31% increase in subscription in the U.K. & Ireland. We now have over 20,000 installations for Sage Drive. A 22% increase in subscription in France driven mainly by the payroll products. Elsewhere in Europe, in Spain, Sage Murano grew by 8%. And in Germany, Sage Office Line grew by 9%. In Enterprise, we have now given full sales responsibility back to the country managers. And despite the overall softness in the Enterprise market in Europe, X3 grew by 5% in Europe; and if you exclude France, outside of France, grew by 19%. It's also worth noting that the regional president for Europe took up his role at the beginning of the year, an internal promotion. The country managers for France and UKI were both internal promotions during the year. And the German country manager was a new external recruit, a great example of seamless transition leadership.\r\nIn North America, the recurring revenue at -- is at 58% of the total and considerably lower than Europe but grew 3 points in the year. Organic revenue of 4% was underpinned by recurring revenue growth of 9%, but overall growth was held back by a slight decline in processing revenue. The recurring revenue growth was achieved by a strong Sage 50 performance in both the U.S. and Canada, with Sage Drive being launched in Canada and due to be launched in the U.S. this half. As I said, this helped a fivefold increase in subscription; and combined with X3 growth of 19%, gives us some encouraging signs for this region.\r\nProcessing revenue growth for the year as a whole was a disappointment. Actions have been taken by the new leadership. And in H2, we've added 30 new independent sales organizations, and in Q4 alone, 1,000 new customer accounts were added. Performance in the SMB sector in North America also improved in the second half, with a focus on reactivating off-plan customers and launching a refreshed partner program. We also launched the cloud versions of Sage 100 and Sage 300, both on subscription.\r\nIn International, recurring revenue growth was 14%; the overall recurring revenue mix, flat at 65%. Organic revenue growth was almost the same at 14% but flattered by a one-off SSRS growth of GBP 4 million in Malaysia driven by legislation changes that we talked about at the interim results. Sage X3 showed particularly strong growth in this region of 33%, with over 20% growth in Africa. This was supplemented by a strong performance in other local Growth products for the Enterprise-size customers such as Pastel-Evolution and VIP People Payroll, both of which showed double-digit growth. We also launched Sage One in Brazil, in Malaysia and in Australia.\r\nIn the Brazilian market, we grew 8% in the year, with software subscription double digit. This is despite challenging economic conditions. And our strategy in Brazil will focus on winning new customers, supported by global products such as Sage One which was launched in the second half and has started to show momentum.\r\nAt the Capital Markets Day, I introduced our plans to create capability and capacity for growth. We are focused on creating one global approach that is scalable while still delivering customer experience locally. As we move into FY '16, our G&A as a percentage of revenue is 19%. I've previously called out a higher number of 21% to 22%, but following the implementation of the new organization, we have moved some costs, for example, country managers, that are now focused on sales to be in the right place, i.e. selling costs. G&A this year has also absorbed around GBP 15 million of unplanned nonrecurring costs, the benefit of which will come through in later years. However to counter that, I would flag that our share-based payment charge is likely to rise in the future as we see more vesting, but this will be absorbed within the targets. \r\nTo allow further investment for growth, we are targeting a run rate saving in G&A in FY '16 of at least GBP 50 million. This will be reinvested principally in sales and marketing. These savings will come from 3 main sources: procurement, sites and headcount. Looking at our current footprint, we have over 3 -- we have 139 sites and over 12,000 suppliers. Half our sites have less than 50 people based at them. As always, we will always talk to our own people first about any changes. However, we have already taken action. We've served notice on 10 sites, and we've started with changes to job roles announced in the U.K. We'll periodically update the market on our progress as we go through these changes. Throughout the transition, we will target a minimum 2-year payback. And so in FY '16, to drive the GBP 50 million in cost savings, it is likely we'll incur an exceptional charge in the region of GBP 100 million.\r\nSo to summarize. We have achieved the targets which were set 3 years ago and successfully closed out the 2012 strategy. We have created momentum into FY '16. And there has been and will continue to be free cash flow, strong free cash flow.\r\nStephen and I are confident that we know how to execute through what will be a pivotal year for Sage, and we believe we have the building blocks in place to deliver on our plans.\r\nAnd with that, I'd like to hand back to Stephen.\n\n---\n\nThanks very much, Steve. I spoke in my opening remarks about the opportunities for Sage. Let me just first outline what's happening out there in the industry and the marketplace.\r\nSo I've been in technology for over 30 years. And today, I'd say it's the most disruptive, exciting time for any of us in terms of technology. For consumers, there's been a massive move over the last few years to mobile and the disruption that it's represented. From literally nowhere, nowhere 8 years ago, we now have approaching 4 billion smartphones around the planet. There's also just an incredible explosion of data. It's just staggering to realize that 90% of the world's data has been created in the last year. It's estimated that by 2020, the volume of data will increase by 50x, not 50%, 50x.\r\nNow Sage is really well placed to benefit from these seismic shifts. And we are confident that the future is a world where entrepreneurs will run their businesses the way that consumers live their lives today: mobile first, leveraging the power of apps and big data. The future is real-time accounting where entrepreneurs control their business from the palm of their hand. Sage is creating this. Sage has a history of pioneering accounting software with the genesis of the PC revolution back in the '80s. Innovation has always been at our roots. And we're innovating again in an era of cloud, mobile, social, big data and analytics; not just catching up, as we might have been in the past, you could argue behind, but leapfrogging the competition and inventing the future. We've only 3 million business customers around the world in an addressable market of 70 million businesses. This is a huge white space opportunity and a tremendous opportunity for new customer attraction that we can drive to create that market opportunity.\r\nToday, there are millions of small and medium businesses that aren't even using an accounting system. Many businesses run themselves on spreadsheets and word processors and lose 2 hours a day to spreadsheets keeping a manual scorecard of the business. Consumers have taken control of their lives, as we all have, and businesses want that control in the same way. The market is ripe for innovation, and Sage is ideally positioned. In fact, I'd argue Sage is the only company that can serve startups, sole traders, through to businesses employing thousands of employees. \r\nWe are also the only one true global player in our industry. We're the market leader in the majority of the markets we serve. For example, in this economy, the U.K, 54% of businesses pay their employees using Sage. And we have an enviable business model with organic growth, strong margins, cash flow, plus disciplined capital management. And with the strength of Sage in Europe, our domain expertise and experience, the resistance of customers to changing their accounting solutions, there are significant barriers for the competition. However, we fully have to grasp this opportunity and deliver the sustainable growth which we believe is possible. We have to transform. We're clear about that, and we outlined that at the Capital Markets Day.\r\nNow let me remind you of CMD and the 5 pillars: First of all, Customers for Life; second, winning in the market; third, revolutionizing business; fourth, capacity for growth; and finally, One Sage. Now, regardless of your favorite expression, we all know that strategy without execution is hallucination. For us, for Steve, myself, this management team, execution and delivery is everything. It's about executing at pace; improving process, systems and people with a strong culture that makes the business growth sustainable. Preparation for this journey has been understanding the business and fixing the basics. The detail is critically important, and Steve, myself and the management team have a laser focus on this.\r\nNow, to our progress. Firstly, on Customer for Life. Every chief executive officer tells you how important customers are, but we are absolutely deadly serious. Building ever-closer relationships underpins our baseline revenue case. I've met thousands of our customers in my first year, and they've told me Sage is indispensable in their business. One headline KPI we measure ourselves and track progress is contract renewals. This year, we've seen a marginal increase from 83% to 84%. Underneath this, there are some encouraging signs that give us confidence that we'll see increasing renewal rates in the years ahead. Our analysis shows that renewals increase to about 90% when customers move to subscription and increase further when customers take multiple Sage products. That's why we're driving subscription growth. And Steve provided the update on the growth of subscription contracts to over 690,000. Therefore, also we've been active cross-selling, cross-selling our products to existing customers at an increasing rate. In U.K. & Ireland, for example, the number of our accounting customers buying Sage Pay is up 160%.\r\nKeeping focus on our existing customers is critical as we scale. We now are measuring Net Promoter Scores on a global basis, having never consistently done so before. What is especially positive is how our messages with customers and partners and accountants of no end of life and no forced migrations have been so well received by the marketplace. Our assessment would be that we've made some encouraging progress on Customer for Life and laid the foundations to drive further improvement but much more to do.\r\nSecondly, winning in the market. We have now, for the first time, a concerted focus on new customer attraction and acquisition so that we can be winning market share. Let me share with you some data points.\r\nSage One, our pure-cloud offering to startup businesses, has seen paying subscriptions more than double to 173,000. In U.K. & Ireland, as Steve highlighted, we've exceeded 100,000 subscribers. And Sage One is now the fastest-growing cloud product in the U.K., adding over 4,500 paying subscribers per month. To ensure that we can win in the digital marketplace, we've launched 2 state-of-the-art Customer Business Centers that will drive world-class digital marketing, lead generation, digital sales and service. These have only been in operation in Atlanta and Dublin for a couple of months, but we're already seeing results. In the U.S., for example, Sage One is now consistently in the top 10 Google searches for online accounting, having spent the last 2 years languishing behind. Sage X3, our global solution for the Enterprise market, has also seen double-digit growth. And again, having met dozens of these X3 customers and based on my personal experience of enterprise software, it's unparalleled to have such high levels of product satisfaction. So we see strong potential for accelerated growth with X3.\r\nWe're building momentum with our global products, winning in key markets, and we've yet to unleash fully the full potential of our new digital marketing capability. So some very early data points of progress but again, much more to do.\r\nRevolutionizing the business. So how can Sage become a positive disruptor in the marketplace, the true champion of small and medium businesses and entrepreneurs? We've certainly rediscovered our technology DNA. And we are revolutionizing business for customers, partners and accountants through the golden triangle of integrated accounting, payroll and payments, supporting the frictionless movement of money. As I said earlier, the market is changing so fast, and in the past, you could argue that Sage may have been slow to react, but in recent months, we have made some bold moves that demonstrate our intent. We aren't interested in playing catch-up. We're genuinely interested in leapfrogging any competition.\r\nLet me give you a couple of examples. Sage Live, developed in 26 weeks in partnership with Salesforce.com, has already 20 early-adopter customers and a strong and growing pipeline. The product is way ahead of anything in the marketplace. One early-adopter, VP of finance said, \"I never thought an accounting solution would give me goose bumps on my arms.\" And Sage Impact, the industry cloud platform for accountants, was brought to market in 51 days and, again, received rave reviews and awards. It's not just about radical new product launches, but it's also about driving value and innovation for our customers with improvements to existing growth products. We're driving agility and productivity to reduce our development cycles. In the last year alone, we delivered over 200 product enhancements.\r\nOur testament to our innovation is that we've now received countless industry awards in the last year, for example, from K2 in the U.S. and Experton in Germany. Innovation does matter to our customers. It's very significant. I've just come back from Vegas, when I spoke at the largest conference for accountants in North America. And we launched 2 new cloud products there, Sage Match and Sage Value. The feedback was that accountants have seen more innovation in the past 12 months than at any other time from Sage and also than any other player in the marketplace. This new world of technology is about platforms and open APIs that create ecosystems to innovate at an accelerated pace beyond the capabilities of any one company. And that's why we've entered into strategic partnerships with a number of high-profile organizations like Salesforce, Microsoft, Google, PwC and Deloitte to add to our thousands of existing partners.\r\nIn terms of revolutionizing business, it's early days, but the evidence and the data points speak for themselves. We've certainly got our technology and innovation mojo right back.\r\nCapacity for growth. We're creating capacity for growth for an efficient, scalable organization which underpins a sustainable business model. Steve covered this earlier and highlighted the GBP 20 million of additional investment in FY '15 for growth in future periods. This isn't just about quantifying efficiencies. We're also building a culture of excellence in governance, excellence in processing systems that can scale as the business grows.\r\nThe quality of Sage leadership is critical to our success. In the past year, we've changed nearly 40% of our top 100 leaders. The majority are experienced new joiners, complemented with a number of internal promotions, but it's not just about the top 100. Across the organization, we are now attracting the best talent from companies like Adobe, Twitter, LinkedIn, Oracle and Microsoft. So we've taken the first steps on our journey to create an efficient, scalable, high-performance organization.\r\nNow One Sage, the last of the pillars but probably a very crucial one, and it underpins everything else we do. You know that, historically, Sage was venerated, disparate and fragmented with huge complexity. We're changing this with the implementation of a new global model and with consistent culture values and behaviors applied throughout the organization. Implementation of the new organization design has already started, leading with 2 of our biggest geographies, France and the U.K. Additionally, it might seem like bread and butter to most organizations, but this is the first time we cascaded consistent and aligned objectives from the executive committee all the way through the organization so every one of our colleagues knows what they are accountable for.\r\nAs another example, we reduced the number of sales compensation plans from 129 to 4 and aligned the bonus for non-sales colleagues. We've also reduced the performance management systems having reduced it from 19 to 1.\r\nAll these move and move at speed but remove complexity and ambiguity from our organization and drive consistency and consistent measurement towards a high-performance company. And all these initiatives were outlined at the FY '16 kickoffs for our colleagues. It's the first time we've run a program of face-to-face communication with all our 13,000 colleagues at the start of the fiscal year. And after, the colleagues, from a poll survey, over 80% of our colleagues said they were proud of the steps Sage is taking. It's really important to bring our colleagues on the journey.\r\nInnovation, like the new Sage Foundation, has caught the imagination of colleagues and created stronger engagement. It's critical, as we can only succeed in our vision with our colleagues with us at our shoulder.\r\nSo bringing this all together, we can demonstrate the momentum that is building around flawless execution on our 5 strategic pillars. We have customers at the heart of everything we do and build ever-closer relationships. We're developing a relentless focus on new customer acquisition to win market share. We have rediscovered our innovation and technology mojo and are revolutionizing business for our customers. We aren't interested in playing catch-up. Everything we do will be about leapfrogging the competition and creating capacity for growth. And very importantly, we're building the right culture, the right behaviors; and applying them consistently throughout our organization to get 13,000 colleagues marching to the One Sage tune.\r\nSo let's turn our attention to outlook. With our transformation, we're building genuine momentum and have positioned ourselves for future sustainable quality growth. We're making first half investments to create further momentum as we exit FY '16. And during this period of transformation, we are confident of achieving at least 6% organic growth and at least 27% organic operating margin as reported on the revised basis. Taken together, this gives our shareholders long-term sustainable growth, superior margins and continued strong cash conversion. So everything at Sage needs to be about inventing amazing technology, winning new customers and growing our Customers for Life. This is where our time, energy and investment is focused.\r\nSo in summary. We're certainly pleased with the fastest rate of organic growth for the last 8 years, and we are pleased that we've exceeded the financial targets set 3 years ago. We've started the transformation outlined at CMD in June 2015 and can certainly see now, today, green shoots of progress, as we've shared with you. We will continue to transparently report our progress against these 5 strategic pillars. Our momentum is building, and our strategy is clear. We have much to do to navigate and manage the operational risks. Our balanced and sequenced approach, combined with the experience of the management team and the strong underlying characteristics of the business, give us great confidence.\r\nNow I'd like to invite Steve to come back and join me. And I'd love to take your questions. And if we can do this one question at a time, that would be really helpful. Because I know some of you have probably got 3 or 4 questions. But we'll rotate it round and come back.\r\nSo who would like to go first, maybe Mo?",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\n[Presentation]\r\nHello, and a very warm welcome to everybody here this morning and the folks on the teleconference. And for those of you who are on the teleconference, we just started with a brief video that featured real Sage customers. Everyone on that video is a customer. So our business is all about entrepreneurs and championing small and medium businesses around the world, who are the powerhouse of every economy.\r\nSo before we get started, I want to give you a quick overview of the agenda for this morning's presentation. I'll provide a brief summary of the performance of my first year. And then I'll hand over to Steve Hare to take you through the numbers. Then I'll come back and update you on the execution progress of the transformation we outlined at Capital Markets Day in June and close with our outlook for FY '16.\r\nPlease note the safe harbor statement on my left, which you can see in your packs and also on our website.\r\nSo when I joined Sage, I was very excited, as I told you last year. For me, this is a great fit, the combination of my experience in technology and my passion for entrepreneurship. After my first year, I have to say I'm even more excited. I've looked under the covers at U.K.'s greatest and largest and most successful technology company over the years and seen huge potential to create something very special for all our stakeholders.\r\nAt CMD, we outlined the steps that we're taking to transform the business, and we committed that we would maintain our financial performance through the transformation period. We've exceeded the financial targets, and this represents the fastest rate of growth for 8 years, but we certainly don't want to get ahead of ourselves as this management team is early in its tenure. We've opened a new chapter for Sage on the journey for high-quality, sustainable growth and can share with you today some of the early signs.\r\nSo the transformation is already underway. Yes, it will take time, and it may be nonlinear with inherent operational risks. FY '16 is a pivotal year for us, but we're building and have built an experienced team and have a balanced and sequenced approach to ensure our success. We're building momentum and starting to see the first green shoots of progress. I'll come back to talk to these after Steve. We're very reassured by the resilient business model that we have in place, and we mean to continue to deliver financially as we transform.\r\nSo I'd like to pass now to Steve, who will talk you through the highlights of the numbers. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nThanks, Stephen, and morning, everyone. So 2 main parts to the presentation today. As usual, I'll talk through the results for FY '15, but first, I'm going to explain the changes that we've made in terms of how we record revenue in order to give improved clarity and transparency and also give you the context of why we've made these changes.\r\nThis slide shows our results on the same basis as we've previously reported in order to give a clear like-for-like comparison. The headline is we've achieved our targets. These results are in line with what we presented at the half year, and the momentum in both recurring revenue and subscription revenue has continued. \r\nThis slide shows the side-by-side reported results against the results using the prior basis to give full transparency of the changes. So why make these changes now? We have completed a comprehensive root and branch review of this business. This has included organization, people, process, internal systems, policies; and we want to make sure that we have the capability to scale the business. Partsof this is reviewing the reporting to ensure that it is consistent with the new business and operating model. Stephen and I wanted to make sure that we had a crystal-clear starting point for the next phase that helps all of our stakeholders clearly understand the underlying commercial transactions. We've consulted with our auditors and with the FRC to ensure that we have the best available advice before reaching our conclusions. Just to be clear, these changes have no impact on cash. The only change is how we record revenue.\r\nSo I'll talk you through the 3 changes and show you the impact. The first impact is to change how we account for upfront payments on a number of accounting and payroll products. This involves reclassifying GBP 55 million into recurring revenue and deferring GBP 3 million into FY '16, therefore reducing SSRS by GBP 58 million. As I will illustrate, this change in definition is driven by the evolution of how we sell and how the customer consumes our products.\r\nThe history was to sell an on-premise product for both accounting and payroll with a separate perpetual license, with an optional maintenance and support contract. The accounting for this is very clear. We recognize the license at the point of delivery and the M&S over the life of the contract. Upgrades would also be recognized at the point of delivery. Our aim is to encourage customers to move to subscription and, as a result, to have one single payment covering a bundled offering. If the customer ceases to pay, then they can't use the product or the service. Again, the accounting for this is very straightforward, with revenue recognized over the life of the contract.\r\nAs part of our Customer for Life strategy, we want to ensure that customers can receive the benefit of a bundled offering while still retaining their on-premise product and deriving value from their perpetual license if that's what they choose. Reacting to this, in the middle of this slide, we illustrate how we've started to sell contracts that have many of the features of a subscription contract but the software is still on a separate license. However, that license is increasingly bundled into the maintenance and support offering, much more so than in the past.\r\nI want to illustrate with 2 examples. The first is Sage 200 in the U.K. & Ireland. We now sell an annual license key to use the software rather than a perpetual license, and this also requires a concurrent M&S contract. The product is connected, and the product will turn off without the validation of a valid license key. This is essentially the same as subscription. Historically, we would have recognized the revenue on the upfront license at the point of delivery, whereas now it will be accounted for as subscription, i.e. over the life of the contract, as this reflects the integrated nature of the offering and how the product is being consumed.\r\nThe second example is Sage 50 Payroll. A perpetual license is actually still sold rather than a license key. However, to maintain the functionality, for example, the updated tax tables, the customer needs to have a current maintenance and support contract. Legally, the product can still be used without an M&S contract, but it doesn't function as intended because the tax tables are not updated. Now this is not subscription. However, it is a bundled contract for the products to work as intended. And therefore, I think it's more appropriate that the upfront payment for the license is now recognized as being integrated and is therefore recognized over the life of the contract rather than being recognized upfront.\r\nThe next change relates to referral commissions paid to independent sales organizations in our North American payments business. Historically, Sage treated the ISOs as a business partner and deducted these commissions from revenue and therefore showed revenue net. I think it's more transparent and more appropriate to show the revenue gross and to treat the referral commission as a cost. The impact is to increase revenue in the year by GBP 46 million and increase the costs by the same amount. There is therefore no impact on absolute profit. However, because we have no revenue -- sorry, because we have revenue with no corresponding increase in profit, the operating margin percentage reduces. This slide illustrates why I think the grossing up is a more appropriate approach. The contractual relationship is between Sage and the end customer. The ISO is not involved in the ongoing relationship. This is very different from, say, a business partner on Sage 300, where the business partner will usually act as a reseller and therefore the business partner is a customer of Sage.\r\nThe final change is to create a new category of revenue called payment processing. Previously, this revenue was included within recurring revenue. And it provides greater transparency to show processing revenue, which is volume driven, separate from software-related recurring revenue.\r\nSo this next slide summarizes and brings together all of the changes. The recurring revenue is impacted by the reclassification from SSRS. The gross-up of referral commissions is included in the line but then gets transferred to processing revenue, i.e. it's part of the GBP 158 million in the next column. Processing revenue is as I've explained and is mainly payment processing, although there is a small amount of payroll outsourcing included. SSRS revenue reduces due to the upfront payments being deferred. The revenue in FY '15 increases by GBP 43 million due to the ISO gross-up of GBP 46 million, which will obviously continue through into future years. And there is a small deferral of GBP 3 million into FY '16.\r\nSo having explained the changes and summarized the impact, I now show all the information on a revised basis, as presented in the annual report and accounts. And as you can see, the impact has to reduce the overall revenue growth to 6% but to increase the recurring revenue slightly to 9%. As previously mentioned, the operating profit is only slightly impacted due to the deferral of the GBP 3 million of revenue. However, the margin percentage reduces more because of the revenue gross-up of the ISO referral commissions.\r\nTo summarize, I believe these changes improve transparency and are consistent with the review of the business that we've undertaken. Going forward, as we accelerate the switch to subscription, we will also look to simplify how we sell to our customers, and this, in turn, will simplify our revenue recognition further.\r\nOrganic revenue growth excludes the acquisitions of Exact and PayChoice, which add GBP 35 million of revenue. These will be included as organic in FY '16. We have chosen not to create any exceptional items this year, but it is worth noting that we've absorbed around GBP 20 million of unplanned investments which will benefit future periods. GBP 15 million of this cost was included in G&A, and GBP 5 million in sales and marketing.\r\nMoving through from operating profit. We had an interest charge of GBP 21 million, which is flat year-on-year; tax of GBP 90 million, which is a reduction in the effective tax rate to 25% which has been driven by a lower rate in the U.K.; and some benefits from prior-year tax planning. I would expect 25% to be at the lower end of the range going forward because I think some of the tax planning will be difficult to sustain. And so I would guide to a range of 25% to 27%, with it being more towards the upper end in the medium term. On a statutory basis, we've taken a goodwill impairment charge of GBP 62 million relating to Brazil given the difficult economic conditions in that country and a more cautious outlook. However, our long-term confidence remains, and achieving 9% recurring revenue growth was a good result.\r\nWe've also achieved EPS growth of 12.6% due to the lower tax rate and some share buybacks earlier in the year. Some U.S. investors have asked us to show depreciation and amortization separately, along with the share-based payment charge, in order to aid comparison with our competitors, and so I include it on this slide. And finally, we announced an 8% increase in dividend, in line with our progressive dividend policy.\r\nI'll now move on to some of the group's cash metrics. Our underlying cash conversion remained strong at 106%, up from 101% last year. Free cash flow of GBP 296 million represents 21% of revenue. The closing net debt is around 1x EBITDA. And just pulling a couple of the numbers out: The M&A relates to PayChoice, which was completed in October 2014. And as I mentioned, the buyback of shares was completed in the early part of the year.\r\nSo I'd now like to look at the revenue categories. As I've already mentioned, we achieved a 6% overall revenue growth driven by a 9% increase in recurring revenue, which, in turn, was driven by a 29% increase in software subscription. We now have over 690,000 software subscription contracts.\r\nI'll call out some strong performance and areas of focus in the regions in later slides, but we are seeing offerings like Sage 50 lead the way in incentivizing customers to move from maintenance and support to subscription. In turn, M&S growth and, therefore, the other recurring revenue category on this slide, is relatively flat. We now have 173,000 subscribers globally on Sage One and have announced that in the U.K. we have surpassed 100,000 subscribers. The revenue is now running at just over GBP 1 million a month.\r\nProcessing revenue is the new category, and this is principally the payments business. 2% growth is not where we want to be, but in recent months, we've seen some new account additions starting to accelerate in North America. And Sage Pay's growth has been much more encouraging. \r\nDecline in SSRS is a consequence of our strategy and, as we've previously called out, will vary depending on the pace of transition and the level of license sales, particularly on products like X3 where subscription adoption is slower.\r\nAt the Capital Markets Day, we shared the new product classifications Growth and Heritage. A year ago, we had 67% of R&D focused on Invest products, which was the old category. We now have 87% of R&D on Growth products and over 90% of sales and marketing. This focus has meant that all of the revenue growth is now coming from Growth products. Initiatives such as core product modernization, including cloud versions of our on-premise products, is really beginning to pay off. And we are seeing collaboration across borders on products like Sage Drive.\r\nOur growth in annualized subscriber base has been and will remain one of our leading measures. There's a number of strong offerings which have seen the number of subscribers grow to over 690,000. Between Sage 50 Accounts and Sage 50 Payroll in the U.K. & Ireland, innovations such as Sage Drive and monetizing enhanced functionality from pension auto-enrollment added GBP 19 million. Sage 50 accounts in the U.S. and Canada contributed GBP 14 million, with Sage Drive being launched in Canada where we saw a fivefold increase in subscription. Sage Drive will be launched in the U.S. this half. The i7 upgrade to SMB payroll in France added GBP 14 million. It's important to note that whilst the strategy is working, this is principally driven by enhanced functionality. In previous periods, we've called out that half our growth has come from price. In this period, it's more like 1/3. On-premise products -- on-premise customers are choosing to substitute their M&S contracts for a more integrated subscription offering. Of our Sage 50 customers who are required to comply with the pension regulation, 58% took up the auto-enrollment option. For i7 payroll in France, 78% of eligible customers have taken up those offerings.\r\nTo maintain growth, we aim to mirror these initiatives on other products, although many smaller businesses in the U.K., actually around 80% by volume, have not yet been required to comply with the pension auto-enrollment.\r\nSage One appears on this chart for the first time and has added GBP 4 million to the growth in ASB. As I mentioned earlier, Sage One now has a run rate of just over GBP 1 million of revenue per month.\r\nMoving now to the regions. This year, we present the International region for the first time. This region effectively is everywhere outside of North America and Europe and is the old AAMEA region plus Brazil. We've taken the opportunity to group these countries together to maximize their similar high-growth economies and the associated white space opportunity.\r\nSo now taking each region in turn and starting with Europe. Overall growth in Europe was 5%, with recurring revenue growth of 8%, but it is worth noting that 75% of revenue in Europe now is recurring. Processing revenue growth of 9% driven by Sage Pay is encouraging, and we've had some good progress integrating Sage Pay into our products in the U.K. & Ireland. \r\nThe highlights are noted on the slide, but I would like to emphasize a few of them. A 31% increase in subscription in the U.K. & Ireland. We now have over 20,000 installations for Sage Drive. A 22% increase in subscription in France driven mainly by the payroll products. Elsewhere in Europe, in Spain, Sage Murano grew by 8%. And in Germany, Sage Office Line grew by 9%. In Enterprise, we have now given full sales responsibility back to the country managers. And despite the overall softness in the Enterprise market in Europe, X3 grew by 5% in Europe; and if you exclude France, outside of France, grew by 19%. It's also worth noting that the regional president for Europe took up his role at the beginning of the year, an internal promotion. The country managers for France and UKI were both internal promotions during the year. And the German country manager was a new external recruit, a great example of seamless transition leadership.\r\nIn North America, the recurring revenue at -- is at 58% of the total and considerably lower than Europe but grew 3 points in the year. Organic revenue of 4% was underpinned by recurring revenue growth of 9%, but overall growth was held back by a slight decline in processing revenue. The recurring revenue growth was achieved by a strong Sage 50 performance in both the U.S. and Canada, with Sage Drive being launched in Canada and due to be launched in the U.S. this half. As I said, this helped a fivefold increase in subscription; and combined with X3 growth of 19%, gives us some encouraging signs for this region.\r\nProcessing revenue growth for the year as a whole was a disappointment. Actions have been taken by the new leadership. And in H2, we've added 30 new independent sales organizations, and in Q4 alone, 1,000 new customer accounts were added. Performance in the SMB sector in North America also improved in the second half, with a focus on reactivating off-plan customers and launching a refreshed partner program. We also launched the cloud versions of Sage 100 and Sage 300, both on subscription.\r\nIn International, recurring revenue growth was 14%; the overall recurring revenue mix, flat at 65%. Organic revenue growth was almost the same at 14% but flattered by a one-off SSRS growth of GBP 4 million in Malaysia driven by legislation changes that we talked about at the interim results. Sage X3 showed particularly strong growth in this region of 33%, with over 20% growth in Africa. This was supplemented by a strong performance in other local Growth products for the Enterprise-size customers such as Pastel-Evolution and VIP People Payroll, both of which showed double-digit growth. We also launched Sage One in Brazil, in Malaysia and in Australia.\r\nIn the Brazilian market, we grew 8% in the year, with software subscription double digit. This is despite challenging economic conditions. And our strategy in Brazil will focus on winning new customers, supported by global products such as Sage One which was launched in the second half and has started to show momentum.\r\nAt the Capital Markets Day, I introduced our plans to create capability and capacity for growth. We are focused on creating one global approach that is scalable while still delivering customer experience locally. As we move into FY '16, our G&A as a percentage of revenue is 19%. I've previously called out a higher number of 21% to 22%, but following the implementation of the new organization, we have moved some costs, for example, country managers, that are now focused on sales to be in the right place, i.e. selling costs. G&A this year has also absorbed around GBP 15 million of unplanned nonrecurring costs, the benefit of which will come through in later years. However to counter that, I would flag that our share-based payment charge is likely to rise in the future as we see more vesting, but this will be absorbed within the targets. \r\nTo allow further investment for growth, we are targeting a run rate saving in G&A in FY '16 of at least GBP 50 million. This will be reinvested principally in sales and marketing. These savings will come from 3 main sources: procurement, sites and headcount. Looking at our current footprint, we have over 3 -- we have 139 sites and over 12,000 suppliers. Half our sites have less than 50 people based at them. As always, we will always talk to our own people first about any changes. However, we have already taken action. We've served notice on 10 sites, and we've started with changes to job roles announced in the U.K. We'll periodically update the market on our progress as we go through these changes. Throughout the transition, we will target a minimum 2-year payback. And so in FY '16, to drive the GBP 50 million in cost savings, it is likely we'll incur an exceptional charge in the region of GBP 100 million.\r\nSo to summarize. We have achieved the targets which were set 3 years ago and successfully closed out the 2012 strategy. We have created momentum into FY '16. And there has been and will continue to be free cash flow, strong free cash flow.\r\nStephen and I are confident that we know how to execute through what will be a pivotal year for Sage, and we believe we have the building blocks in place to deliver on our plans.\r\nAnd with that, I'd like to hand back to Stephen.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nThanks very much, Steve. I spoke in my opening remarks about the opportunities for Sage. Let me just first outline what's happening out there in the industry and the marketplace.\r\nSo I've been in technology for over 30 years. And today, I'd say it's the most disruptive, exciting time for any of us in terms of technology. For consumers, there's been a massive move over the last few years to mobile and the disruption that it's represented. From literally nowhere, nowhere 8 years ago, we now have approaching 4 billion smartphones around the planet. There's also just an incredible explosion of data. It's just staggering to realize that 90% of the world's data has been created in the last year. It's estimated that by 2020, the volume of data will increase by 50x, not 50%, 50x.\r\nNow Sage is really well placed to benefit from these seismic shifts. And we are confident that the future is a world where entrepreneurs will run their businesses the way that consumers live their lives today: mobile first, leveraging the power of apps and big data. The future is real-time accounting where entrepreneurs control their business from the palm of their hand. Sage is creating this. Sage has a history of pioneering accounting software with the genesis of the PC revolution back in the '80s. Innovation has always been at our roots. And we're innovating again in an era of cloud, mobile, social, big data and analytics; not just catching up, as we might have been in the past, you could argue behind, but leapfrogging the competition and inventing the future. We've only 3 million business customers around the world in an addressable market of 70 million businesses. This is a huge white space opportunity and a tremendous opportunity for new customer attraction that we can drive to create that market opportunity.\r\nToday, there are millions of small and medium businesses that aren't even using an accounting system. Many businesses run themselves on spreadsheets and word processors and lose 2 hours a day to spreadsheets keeping a manual scorecard of the business. Consumers have taken control of their lives, as we all have, and businesses want that control in the same way. The market is ripe for innovation, and Sage is ideally positioned. In fact, I'd argue Sage is the only company that can serve startups, sole traders, through to businesses employing thousands of employees. \r\nWe are also the only one true global player in our industry. We're the market leader in the majority of the markets we serve. For example, in this economy, the U.K, 54% of businesses pay their employees using Sage. And we have an enviable business model with organic growth, strong margins, cash flow, plus disciplined capital management. And with the strength of Sage in Europe, our domain expertise and experience, the resistance of customers to changing their accounting solutions, there are significant barriers for the competition. However, we fully have to grasp this opportunity and deliver the sustainable growth which we believe is possible. We have to transform. We're clear about that, and we outlined that at the Capital Markets Day.\r\nNow let me remind you of CMD and the 5 pillars: First of all, Customers for Life; second, winning in the market; third, revolutionizing business; fourth, capacity for growth; and finally, One Sage. Now, regardless of your favorite expression, we all know that strategy without execution is hallucination. For us, for Steve, myself, this management team, execution and delivery is everything. It's about executing at pace; improving process, systems and people with a strong culture that makes the business growth sustainable. Preparation for this journey has been understanding the business and fixing the basics. The detail is critically important, and Steve, myself and the management team have a laser focus on this.\r\nNow, to our progress. Firstly, on Customer for Life. Every chief executive officer tells you how important customers are, but we are absolutely deadly serious. Building ever-closer relationships underpins our baseline revenue case. I've met thousands of our customers in my first year, and they've told me Sage is indispensable in their business. One headline KPI we measure ourselves and track progress is contract renewals. This year, we've seen a marginal increase from 83% to 84%. Underneath this, there are some encouraging signs that give us confidence that we'll see increasing renewal rates in the years ahead. Our analysis shows that renewals increase to about 90% when customers move to subscription and increase further when customers take multiple Sage products. That's why we're driving subscription growth. And Steve provided the update on the growth of subscription contracts to over 690,000. Therefore, also we've been active cross-selling, cross-selling our products to existing customers at an increasing rate. In U.K. & Ireland, for example, the number of our accounting customers buying Sage Pay is up 160%.\r\nKeeping focus on our existing customers is critical as we scale. We now are measuring Net Promoter Scores on a global basis, having never consistently done so before. What is especially positive is how our messages with customers and partners and accountants of no end of life and no forced migrations have been so well received by the marketplace. Our assessment would be that we've made some encouraging progress on Customer for Life and laid the foundations to drive further improvement but much more to do.\r\nSecondly, winning in the market. We have now, for the first time, a concerted focus on new customer attraction and acquisition so that we can be winning market share. Let me share with you some data points.\r\nSage One, our pure-cloud offering to startup businesses, has seen paying subscriptions more than double to 173,000. In U.K. & Ireland, as Steve highlighted, we've exceeded 100,000 subscribers. And Sage One is now the fastest-growing cloud product in the U.K., adding over 4,500 paying subscribers per month. To ensure that we can win in the digital marketplace, we've launched 2 state-of-the-art Customer Business Centers that will drive world-class digital marketing, lead generation, digital sales and service. These have only been in operation in Atlanta and Dublin for a couple of months, but we're already seeing results. In the U.S., for example, Sage One is now consistently in the top 10 Google searches for online accounting, having spent the last 2 years languishing behind. Sage X3, our global solution for the Enterprise market, has also seen double-digit growth. And again, having met dozens of these X3 customers and based on my personal experience of enterprise software, it's unparalleled to have such high levels of product satisfaction. So we see strong potential for accelerated growth with X3.\r\nWe're building momentum with our global products, winning in key markets, and we've yet to unleash fully the full potential of our new digital marketing capability. So some very early data points of progress but again, much more to do.\r\nRevolutionizing the business. So how can Sage become a positive disruptor in the marketplace, the true champion of small and medium businesses and entrepreneurs? We've certainly rediscovered our technology DNA. And we are revolutionizing business for customers, partners and accountants through the golden triangle of integrated accounting, payroll and payments, supporting the frictionless movement of money. As I said earlier, the market is changing so fast, and in the past, you could argue that Sage may have been slow to react, but in recent months, we have made some bold moves that demonstrate our intent. We aren't interested in playing catch-up. We're genuinely interested in leapfrogging any competition.\r\nLet me give you a couple of examples. Sage Live, developed in 26 weeks in partnership with Salesforce.com, has already 20 early-adopter customers and a strong and growing pipeline. The product is way ahead of anything in the marketplace. One early-adopter, VP of finance said, \"I never thought an accounting solution would give me goose bumps on my arms.\" And Sage Impact, the industry cloud platform for accountants, was brought to market in 51 days and, again, received rave reviews and awards. It's not just about radical new product launches, but it's also about driving value and innovation for our customers with improvements to existing growth products. We're driving agility and productivity to reduce our development cycles. In the last year alone, we delivered over 200 product enhancements.\r\nOur testament to our innovation is that we've now received countless industry awards in the last year, for example, from K2 in the U.S. and Experton in Germany. Innovation does matter to our customers. It's very significant. I've just come back from Vegas, when I spoke at the largest conference for accountants in North America. And we launched 2 new cloud products there, Sage Match and Sage Value. The feedback was that accountants have seen more innovation in the past 12 months than at any other time from Sage and also than any other player in the marketplace. This new world of technology is about platforms and open APIs that create ecosystems to innovate at an accelerated pace beyond the capabilities of any one company. And that's why we've entered into strategic partnerships with a number of high-profile organizations like Salesforce, Microsoft, Google, PwC and Deloitte to add to our thousands of existing partners.\r\nIn terms of revolutionizing business, it's early days, but the evidence and the data points speak for themselves. We've certainly got our technology and innovation mojo right back.\r\nCapacity for growth. We're creating capacity for growth for an efficient, scalable organization which underpins a sustainable business model. Steve covered this earlier and highlighted the GBP 20 million of additional investment in FY '15 for growth in future periods. This isn't just about quantifying efficiencies. We're also building a culture of excellence in governance, excellence in processing systems that can scale as the business grows.\r\nThe quality of Sage leadership is critical to our success. In the past year, we've changed nearly 40% of our top 100 leaders. The majority are experienced new joiners, complemented with a number of internal promotions, but it's not just about the top 100. Across the organization, we are now attracting the best talent from companies like Adobe, Twitter, LinkedIn, Oracle and Microsoft. So we've taken the first steps on our journey to create an efficient, scalable, high-performance organization.\r\nNow One Sage, the last of the pillars but probably a very crucial one, and it underpins everything else we do. You know that, historically, Sage was venerated, disparate and fragmented with huge complexity. We're changing this with the implementation of a new global model and with consistent culture values and behaviors applied throughout the organization. Implementation of the new organization design has already started, leading with 2 of our biggest geographies, France and the U.K. Additionally, it might seem like bread and butter to most organizations, but this is the first time we cascaded consistent and aligned objectives from the executive committee all the way through the organization so every one of our colleagues knows what they are accountable for.\r\nAs another example, we reduced the number of sales compensation plans from 129 to 4 and aligned the bonus for non-sales colleagues. We've also reduced the performance management systems having reduced it from 19 to 1.\r\nAll these move and move at speed but remove complexity and ambiguity from our organization and drive consistency and consistent measurement towards a high-performance company. And all these initiatives were outlined at the FY '16 kickoffs for our colleagues. It's the first time we've run a program of face-to-face communication with all our 13,000 colleagues at the start of the fiscal year. And after, the colleagues, from a poll survey, over 80% of our colleagues said they were proud of the steps Sage is taking. It's really important to bring our colleagues on the journey.\r\nInnovation, like the new Sage Foundation, has caught the imagination of colleagues and created stronger engagement. It's critical, as we can only succeed in our vision with our colleagues with us at our shoulder.\r\nSo bringing this all together, we can demonstrate the momentum that is building around flawless execution on our 5 strategic pillars. We have customers at the heart of everything we do and build ever-closer relationships. We're developing a relentless focus on new customer acquisition to win market share. We have rediscovered our innovation and technology mojo and are revolutionizing business for our customers. We aren't interested in playing catch-up. Everything we do will be about leapfrogging the competition and creating capacity for growth. And very importantly, we're building the right culture, the right behaviors; and applying them consistently throughout our organization to get 13,000 colleagues marching to the One Sage tune.\r\nSo let's turn our attention to outlook. With our transformation, we're building genuine momentum and have positioned ourselves for future sustainable quality growth. We're making first half investments to create further momentum as we exit FY '16. And during this period of transformation, we are confident of achieving at least 6% organic growth and at least 27% organic operating margin as reported on the revised basis. Taken together, this gives our shareholders long-term sustainable growth, superior margins and continued strong cash conversion. So everything at Sage needs to be about inventing amazing technology, winning new customers and growing our Customers for Life. This is where our time, energy and investment is focused.\r\nSo in summary. We're certainly pleased with the fastest rate of organic growth for the last 8 years, and we are pleased that we've exceeded the financial targets set 3 years ago. We've started the transformation outlined at CMD in June 2015 and can certainly see now, today, green shoots of progress, as we've shared with you. We will continue to transparently report our progress against these 5 strategic pillars. Our momentum is building, and our strategy is clear. We have much to do to navigate and manage the operational risks. Our balanced and sequenced approach, combined with the experience of the management team and the strong underlying characteristics of the business, give us great confidence.\r\nNow I'd like to invite Steve to come back and join me. And I'd love to take your questions. And if we can do this one question at a time, that would be really helpful. Because I know some of you have probably got 3 or 4 questions. But we'll rotate it round and come back.\r\nSo who would like to go first, maybe Mo?",
      "transcript_text3": "Yes, we've got a mic. And this is quite a good hint to sit at the front. You get your first question. Go for it.\n\n---\n\nStephen, can you talk a bit about the dynamics in that at least 6% organic growth guidance between the SSRS and recurring? Because I think -- in the fourth quarter, I think the SSRS was a little bit better than, I think, you had anticipated. So how should we think of that as we move forward?\n\n---\n\nYes, do you want to go straight into that, Steve?\n\n---\n\nYes. So I think, probably consistent with what we said at the Capital Markets Day, the uncertainty is exactly where SSRS will come out. We've got strong recurring revenue growth. And we're confident that from the base that we've got this year of 9% recurring revenue growth, we'll continue to make progress on that. But because this, the recurring revenue growth, is occurring within the installed base, what we're obviously doing is moving more people away from the sort of upfront licenses, and therefore, the underlying trend on SSRS is down. However, we are still selling X3, particularly on upfront licenses, and therefore, that counteracts that. So we don't run the business on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but there will be some reporting periods where SSRS declines. And then there'll be other reporting periods where, either because of X3 growth or because there's some spike in professional services or something within SSRS, might give us a little bit of a boost. But on an underlying basis, SSRS is going to decline.\n\n---\n\nGo for it, Amit, yes. And then we'll come to the back.\n\n---\n\nAmit Harchandani from Citigroup. You talked about the GBP 50 million in savings and a charge being needed in the range of about GBP 100 million. You talked about the various measures that you will be taking to achieve those savings. Could you give us a sense of how the charge breaks down in terms of the measures that you are going for? And is this first of many within the transition phase, or do you think this is pretty much what you would need to get to the medium-term ambitions that you have?\n\n---\n\nGood questions.\n\n---\n\nYes, so I'll disappoint you a little bit, first, in terms of a reluctance to break down the charge. I think it's important that we communicate with our people what we're doing as we go through country by country and make changes. You won't see us making any big global announcements about what we're doing to drive the cost savings. It will happen country by country as we go through and create operational efficiency, and we'll give progress as -- after we've made those decisions. In terms of the charge for the year, we don't want to get a reputation for being a management team that constantly creates exceptional items and is constantly saying that things are nothing to do with business as usual. So our aim is that we will -- in FY '16, which we see as the pivotal year, we will take an exceptional charge. We will do the bulk of what we need to do to reshape this business, and we will aim to keep it within FY '16. Now, I'm not giving an absolute, unequivocal guarantee that there won't be any exceptional charge in FY '17, but it is not our aim to constantly draw this out year after year. Efficiency will become part of how we run Sage, so in the future, if there's things that we're doing on an ongoing basis, we'll treat that as business as usual, but given the substantive pivotal nature of what we're doing in FY '16, I do think it's appropriate to pull it out as exceptional.\n\n---\n\nRight, thanks, Amit. Milan?\n\n---\n\nMilan Radia from Jefferies. The first question was, Steve, in the past, on the old basis of G&A, you talked about 600 to 700 basis points potentially of margin sort of expansion potential as those kind of number of sites came down and so on. I know you've kind of tweaked down that G&A element a little bit. Where do you sort of now sit in terms of that margin potential? And what kind of time frame should we think about for that?\n\n---\n\nYes, so I think the first thing is obviously that the GBP 50 million that we're calling out is about 350 basis points. So you could say that that's a little lower than we've talked about in terms of potential in the past, but the potential we've talked about in the past is over a period of time. So what we're doing is committing that in FY '16, we will take this sort of initial change and pull those cost savings out. What will happen over a 2- to 3-year period is as we start to implement new systems and processes internally and as we get more of a continuous improvement culture internally, we will also start to drive efficiencies out more naturally. So to give you an example: This year, globally, we hired nearly 3,000 people. So we can achieve cost savings just by hiring less people. This is not about just removing existing roles. It's also about making sure that if we're growing at 6% per annum but we're holding G&A -- we restructure G&A and then we hold it reasonably flat, we'll also grow into it. So we still see the potential after the transitional years. And we've been asked previously how long is a transitional year. It's probably 2 to 3 years, but we have a period where we need to over-invest in sales and marketing in order to invest for growth. That period, there'll come a point where we don't need to over-invest to the same degree, and therefore, by definition, the operating margin will rise. It will rise above what we're saying over the next few years, but I think you've got to give us some time to work through the next few years, get the efficiency bedded down and then, no doubt, we'll come under pressure to identify exactly how much the -- we're going to allow to flow through to the margin eventually. I have, in the past, said, eventually, I'm sure, an operating margin will begin with a 3, but we'll see when.\n\n---\n\nAnd, Milan, if you could pass it along to Stacy?\n\n---\n\nCan I -- I was just going to sneak in one second.\n\n---\n\nOh, Milan.\n\n---\n\nYou said, one at a time and not one per person, but...\n\n---\n\nHow very -- you're kind of extending the rules. Go for it.\n\n---\n\nJust on the U.S. payments side, I suppose. I mean, if you talk to a Worldpay, for example, they would cast into doubt the role of the ISOs over time. And they feel that's a kind of shrinking component of the U.S. payments market. So I don't know where you stand on that because I know you're still placing a degree of emphasis on the ISOs. And then do you need to own the U.S. payments business? I suppose, in a consolidating market, there's a risk that Sage Pay and all of its kind of market starts to look a little bit subscale potentially.\n\n---\n\nI think, at the moment, for what we're seeing, particularly from the customers, is strong feedback saying the movement of money between accounting, payroll, HR and payments is huge value; both money going out to suppliers and money coming in from customers. So there's value in that, and I think that's definitely playing out in the U.S. Obviously, I would say also the world of payments is a disruptive market. I talked about disruption. You can accelerate that in the world of payments. So it's probably appropriate for another day to come back and star-gaze the future strategically where we see payments going, but that's probably another Capital Markets Day in 6 months' time. But today, our customers are in good shape. And I think, again, Steve highlighted in the fourth quarter particularly, under the leadership of Paul Bridgewater in the U.S., we've got our arms around the issues. And we're seeing some, again, data points around the progress there. Stacy?\n\n---\n\nStacy Pollard with JP Morgan. Can you talk more about the competitive environment? You mentioned barriers for the competition, and you also talked about leapfrogging the competition. Can you tell us who you're seeing on a head-to-head basis; where you're winning; when you are; when you're not, that kind of thing?\n\n---\n\nYes, well, this is -- I could talk for hours on this, but it's important that, for the last year, we've been very operational. So we've met a lot of customers we've talked to partners, accountants. I'd say, if you look at the startup marketplace, you guys have covered that pretty well. I think we relate to that marketplace, particularly in the cloud, but we've really seen a great acceleration. And calling out Lee Perkins sitting here that runs the U.K., tremendous performance in terms of Sage One, seeing 4,500 subscribers a month and going beyond the 100,000 subscriber in the U.K. So that's the fastest-performing, growing on a monthly basis cloud solution for startups. So that's great. But I think, there, we've got more to do in terms of digital marketing, further engagement with accountants, but there are -- in that area and actually, what I'd call the next segment of the sort of 100 employees, 200, you typically find, Stacy, every geography is different. So if I go to France, I'll see a different set of competitors than if I go to Spain. If I go to the U.S., I'll see a different set of competitors. If I go to Brazil, I'll see different competitors. So I could give you -- and typically, you're seeing companies that have grown up or invented companies in the last 5 to 10 years but they're very geographically disparate. The good news is, takeaway, Sage is the only global player in this space that's got a presence, strong presence, in Europe; strong presence in North America. And in places like Canada, we're #1 in the marketplace. So I think there is strength that we can build on, and that's why it's important to leapfrog and really play out the Customer for Life around our existing customers because that supports the baseline revenue growth. Then the last one, I'll just pause on and reflect on for X3 because obviously, now, we move up in the Enterprise. And we've actually got X3 supporting companies of more than 20,000 employees, so it's very scalable, particularly in the manufacturing, process and discrete manufacturing, very competitive. I'll give you some really granular data from one of the regions where we highlighted this on the watch list of the U.S.A. It's surprising, actually. So we got involved in the U.S. last year, and we had a win rate of 46%. We won 80 new customers. We lost 92. I think 46% works for the arithmetic. And the surprising thing is none of the competitors we looked at, because we did win-loss analysis, were the guys that you guys write about. So the -- I'll call out a couple of names. There's only -- so there's 20% of the losses are against people you've never heard of, regional players, very kind of boutique niche players with deep, rich vertical functionality; never heard of them. Then there was only 2 players above 10%, and that was actually Epicor and Microsoft, where we actually came up against them. But then all the other guys, including the guys you write about, the SAPs, the NetSuites, were less than 10%, yes. There was 8 companies less than 10% but of more than 3%. So again, what does that tell me? That tells me actually, a huge market opportunity. There's -- when you worry about this in enterprise software, particularly at that level, is when you see a gorilla in the market you're going up against all the time. That's definitely not the case. So I think there's a huge opportunity. And when I look at the reference-ability and the strength of our customers and the feedback they give me on the X3 product, it's just astounding literally in terms of the quality of the product. And it does what it says on the tin of functionality. And the customers, 46% win rate, again, just to play back to you, is just almost unheard of in Enterprise. You typically would have 30%. So the reality, what have we got to do? We've got to show up at more parties, really simple. And we've got to -- and we've been hiring sales and marketing in all the geographies. In the area of X3, which we called out in the watch list in Europe, we've changed the structure. That's all being run in the countries, reporting to the managing directors. We've changed the management team there as well. And when you look at -- if you exclude France with a 19% growth rate for X3, again, I think you can clearly see some strength there. To answer your question, summary, is the good news is very disparate competition. Segment by segment, it's different. There's no one who goes from a startup like Sage One through to X3. And you think of a business. Do you want to change your accounting system every 5 years as you go from 50 employees to 100? Some of our customers on Sage Live started 2 years ago with 10 consultants. They now have 200 people today. So the scale of growth with some of our customers going particularly from startup through to tens, hundreds of people, there's tremendous benefits from staying with the same supplier. And when they feed back to me words like indispensable, it gives me great comfort, but the reality is we've got to execute way better, particularly on sales and marketing. Michael?\n\n---\n\nStephen, in terms of Sage One, can you talk a bit about the regional performance outside the U.K.? Obviously, it's strong here, but maybe North America specifically. And then for the mid-market cloud, you mentioned, I think, X3 is now available. Is that multitenant? What is your sort of strategy above Sage Live in terms of the multitenant offerings?\n\n---\n\nYes, so start with the first question. And we've come breaking the rules on multiple questions, so I'll try and be brief with my answer. So Sage One, disappointed still in the North America. So we've got about 9,000 subscribers. And I think we'll see a real period -- with the 2 elements, you've got to have -- well, 3. You've got to have a great product. We've got a great product. Secondly, you've got to have accountants, strong engagement. We've got Jennifer leading that worldwide. And we're making huge progress with the accountant channel and the bookkeepers because they are very influential, recommending accounting solutions to their clients. And the third thing is around digital marketing. And I shared with you we've yet to unleash the full potential of our digital marketing. We hired a guy called Neil Morgan, who did all this stuff at Adobe, Socialbakers; and made a massive difference. And now we're seeing Sage One in the U.S. as 1 of the top 10 Google searches. So it's coming together but more to do. Some of the other areas where we actually -- through great conviction of Jorge down in Brazil, launches Sage One, and we get, what, 7,000 subscribers within 6 months. So tremendous momentum in an economy where it's kind of creeping into recession. And the other probably notable element from Sage One is we launched it in Australia in the last 6 months and we now have 1,000 subscribers. So we've got a big plan in ANZ. So Sage One, I think we've -- now are available in more than a dozen countries, and we're seeing increasing progress. Then around X3, X3 cloud made available with rich functionality using the AWS platform. So it takes the inherent competence and capability from the platforms. And as we shift forward, this is a bit of a Capital Markets Day shift, but we're going to move towards multitenant cloud platforms right across the piece. And obviously, Salesforce, with Salesforce1, is the first real incarnation of that. And what we actually see relevant to X3 is a lot of the other guys you probably write about are first-generation cloud, so they invented their cloud architecture pre mobile, pre HTML5. And therefore, the stuff we get for free, like different Android device comes out, it's all inherent, different UI. They have to recode that. So a lot of them have to hard code right through to a database management system that they built for the first-generation cloud systems. So I think we can innovate and disrupt much quicker and drive much better functionality much quicker than any competitors out there by going to multitenant cloud platforms. David? Then we'll go next, yes.\n\n---\n\nIt's David Toms from Numis. Can we just dig into the seasonality a little bit more for the forthcoming year? You talked about a degree of investment weighting to the first half. Can you just sort of tell us what you think the margin weighting is and also whether there might be any revenue weighting that's unusual within the year?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think the signaling is more the investment from a margin perspective. Obviously, as we drive more to a recurring revenue model, it's very important, to state the obvious, that we get off to a good start because you can't catch up by selling perpetual licenses in the second half. So particularly around digital marketing, we're looking just to make sure that we have the appropriate level of investment to support what we're trying to do in FY '16. And we're just giving ourselves a little bit of room for maneuver in case we want to over-invest a little bit in the first half. I think in terms of the revenue, the revenue won't be particularly seasonal, so we're not signaling that there'll be any particular softness in the revenue in the first half, but we're reserving the ability to maybe be slightly under the margin if we so wish. The margin for the year as a whole will be fine, but it might be a bit more weighted to the front -- to the first half. It might not be. I'm not saying absolutely it will be, but we're reserving our rights, if you like.\n\n---\n\nAnd I'm afraid we've got time for one more question, but I thank you for your patience waiting.\n\n---\n\nIt's Vijay Anand from Mirabaud. My question is on the ASB revenue bridge. So looking at that bridge, the contribution from North America is still quite small relative to the size of the market. So could you talk about how you expect the subscription push, the sales and marketing investments to impact performance in this region? And is my understanding right that in order to get North America to grow in line with group average, i.e. 6%, you need more from new customers because you have a relatively small installed base there? So could you talk about that, please?\n\n---\n\nI'll kick off, and then maybe Steve specifically. So in North America, we've done quite a lot of thing. And again, we signaled some changes to the management, leadership. And also, what was very successful, credit to Alvaro, is driving core product modernization in Europe. And I think the guys in France and the U.K. are benefiting from that today. So exposing the capability of on premise to the cloud, hybrid, Sage Drive; and really taking advantage of a subscriber model but all the benefits of the cloud as well. In essence, we've been doing that over the last 6 to 9 months in North America as well. So we launched something called Sage 100c and Sage 300; and again got, I wouldn't say raptures, but really positive feedback from the channel, the partners and the customers. And I see those sort of initiatives that we've taken where we made investments in FY '15 as revenue drivers because we're moving that all to the Growth products on subscription. So I would definitely see, in North America, one of the things you should watch for against the metrics, particularly around Customer for Life, is America picking up the pace as well regionally. And we've got some elements of the foundations in place of investments we made in FY '15 to make that a reality.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think the difference, if I can contrast between Europe and North America, is that before both Stephen and I were here, the European management team made a decision to invest in what's -- what we've called core product modernization. So they invested in the existing on-premise products like Sage 50, like Sage 100 in France. And what the European team are doing is using that now as a hook to switch existing customers to subscription by driving value. They're not going to customers and putting prices up. They're going to customers and saying, \"Here's features which improve productivity of your business, and it's available on subscription.\" Historically, we've called out previously, North America drove most of their growth through price and through upselling maintenance and support. So they just upsell through the various tiers. We have, of late, started to switch the investments to the appropriate place in North America, so we've launched Sage 100 and 300 cloud versions. And we are collaborating across border to launch Sage 50 Drive in the U.S., already launched in Canada. So what you'll see in the next sort of year or 2 is the North American business start to adopt a more, if I can use the phrase, European-style approach to driving value in the installed base. Why is Europe growing so strongly? Why has it got 75% recurring revenue mix? Because they're focused on their installed base. Actually, the new -- with the exception of Sage One, new customer acquisition is not taking off to the degree that it will need to in the next few years at the moment. The growth today is coming from successful management of the installed base. And the good news is 2/3 of the growth is coming from something other than price. What we should do is see North America start to grow more strongly as we see that coming through. And then the second thing is North America is being dragged by the payments business. North America is just over GBP 400 million of revenue. And GBP 100 million of that is payments processing, and that's not growing at the moment. So we see that coming through. I don't think we'll get back to double digit this year with payments processing in North America, but I do think it'll be mid- to high single digit, and that will also help to boost the growth.\n\n---\n\nThat's great. And I think probably it's worth saying obviously, that the existing and installed customer base supports the baseline revenue growth case. And obviously, I think it's -- we've been together a year, the management team together a year. We've got a lot of execution to do in operations, but most of what we're talking about is just better sales and marketing execution. We've made the bets on the technology and we've made the investments. Now it's about following the lead and ensuring we really raise our bar in terms of capability of execution operationally.\r\nI'm really sorry we haven't got any more time for questions, but just we'll be around for a few minutes. We've got Anna Campopiano. And we've got Simon John, Investor Relations, so if there's anything you want to catch up with us offline, then please do so. And Simon's details, I think, are on the packs, so if there's any questions you've got, then do feel free to contact us.\r\nThank you very much for your support, and thank you for coming today.",
      "transcript_text4": "【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nYes, we've got a mic. And this is quite a good hint to sit at the front. You get your first question. Go for it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mohammed Moawalla (Analysts)】\nStephen, can you talk a bit about the dynamics in that at least 6% organic growth guidance between the SSRS and recurring? Because I think -- in the fourth quarter, I think the SSRS was a little bit better than, I think, you had anticipated. So how should we think of that as we move forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nYes, do you want to go straight into that, Steve?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nYes. So I think, probably consistent with what we said at the Capital Markets Day, the uncertainty is exactly where SSRS will come out. We've got strong recurring revenue growth. And we're confident that from the base that we've got this year of 9% recurring revenue growth, we'll continue to make progress on that. But because this, the recurring revenue growth, is occurring within the installed base, what we're obviously doing is moving more people away from the sort of upfront licenses, and therefore, the underlying trend on SSRS is down. However, we are still selling X3, particularly on upfront licenses, and therefore, that counteracts that. So we don't run the business on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but there will be some reporting periods where SSRS declines. And then there'll be other reporting periods where, either because of X3 growth or because there's some spike in professional services or something within SSRS, might give us a little bit of a boost. But on an underlying basis, SSRS is going to decline.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nGo for it, Amit, yes. And then we'll come to the back.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Amit Harchandani (Analysts)】\nAmit Harchandani from Citigroup. You talked about the GBP 50 million in savings and a charge being needed in the range of about GBP 100 million. You talked about the various measures that you will be taking to achieve those savings. Could you give us a sense of how the charge breaks down in terms of the measures that you are going for? And is this first of many within the transition phase, or do you think this is pretty much what you would need to get to the medium-term ambitions that you have?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nGood questions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nYes, so I'll disappoint you a little bit, first, in terms of a reluctance to break down the charge. I think it's important that we communicate with our people what we're doing as we go through country by country and make changes. You won't see us making any big global announcements about what we're doing to drive the cost savings. It will happen country by country as we go through and create operational efficiency, and we'll give progress as -- after we've made those decisions. In terms of the charge for the year, we don't want to get a reputation for being a management team that constantly creates exceptional items and is constantly saying that things are nothing to do with business as usual. So our aim is that we will -- in FY '16, which we see as the pivotal year, we will take an exceptional charge. We will do the bulk of what we need to do to reshape this business, and we will aim to keep it within FY '16. Now, I'm not giving an absolute, unequivocal guarantee that there won't be any exceptional charge in FY '17, but it is not our aim to constantly draw this out year after year. Efficiency will become part of how we run Sage, so in the future, if there's things that we're doing on an ongoing basis, we'll treat that as business as usual, but given the substantive pivotal nature of what we're doing in FY '16, I do think it's appropriate to pull it out as exceptional.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nRight, thanks, Amit. Milan?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Milan Radia (Analysts)】\nMilan Radia from Jefferies. The first question was, Steve, in the past, on the old basis of G&A, you talked about 600 to 700 basis points potentially of margin sort of expansion potential as those kind of number of sites came down and so on. I know you've kind of tweaked down that G&A element a little bit. Where do you sort of now sit in terms of that margin potential? And what kind of time frame should we think about for that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nYes, so I think the first thing is obviously that the GBP 50 million that we're calling out is about 350 basis points. So you could say that that's a little lower than we've talked about in terms of potential in the past, but the potential we've talked about in the past is over a period of time. So what we're doing is committing that in FY '16, we will take this sort of initial change and pull those cost savings out. What will happen over a 2- to 3-year period is as we start to implement new systems and processes internally and as we get more of a continuous improvement culture internally, we will also start to drive efficiencies out more naturally. So to give you an example: This year, globally, we hired nearly 3,000 people. So we can achieve cost savings just by hiring less people. This is not about just removing existing roles. It's also about making sure that if we're growing at 6% per annum but we're holding G&A -- we restructure G&A and then we hold it reasonably flat, we'll also grow into it. So we still see the potential after the transitional years. And we've been asked previously how long is a transitional year. It's probably 2 to 3 years, but we have a period where we need to over-invest in sales and marketing in order to invest for growth. That period, there'll come a point where we don't need to over-invest to the same degree, and therefore, by definition, the operating margin will rise. It will rise above what we're saying over the next few years, but I think you've got to give us some time to work through the next few years, get the efficiency bedded down and then, no doubt, we'll come under pressure to identify exactly how much the -- we're going to allow to flow through to the margin eventually. I have, in the past, said, eventually, I'm sure, an operating margin will begin with a 3, but we'll see when.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nAnd, Milan, if you could pass it along to Stacy?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Milan Radia (Analysts)】\nCan I -- I was just going to sneak in one second.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nOh, Milan.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Milan Radia (Analysts)】\nYou said, one at a time and not one per person, but...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nHow very -- you're kind of extending the rules. Go for it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Milan Radia (Analysts)】\nJust on the U.S. payments side, I suppose. I mean, if you talk to a Worldpay, for example, they would cast into doubt the role of the ISOs over time. And they feel that's a kind of shrinking component of the U.S. payments market. So I don't know where you stand on that because I know you're still placing a degree of emphasis on the ISOs. And then do you need to own the U.S. payments business? I suppose, in a consolidating market, there's a risk that Sage Pay and all of its kind of market starts to look a little bit subscale potentially.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nI think, at the moment, for what we're seeing, particularly from the customers, is strong feedback saying the movement of money between accounting, payroll, HR and payments is huge value; both money going out to suppliers and money coming in from customers. So there's value in that, and I think that's definitely playing out in the U.S. Obviously, I would say also the world of payments is a disruptive market. I talked about disruption. You can accelerate that in the world of payments. So it's probably appropriate for another day to come back and star-gaze the future strategically where we see payments going, but that's probably another Capital Markets Day in 6 months' time. But today, our customers are in good shape. And I think, again, Steve highlighted in the fourth quarter particularly, under the leadership of Paul Bridgewater in the U.S., we've got our arms around the issues. And we're seeing some, again, data points around the progress there. Stacy?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stacy Pollard (Analysts)】\nStacy Pollard with JP Morgan. Can you talk more about the competitive environment? You mentioned barriers for the competition, and you also talked about leapfrogging the competition.

So a lot of them have to hard code right through to a database management system that they built for the first-generation cloud systems. So I think we can innovate and disrupt much quicker and drive much better functionality much quicker than any competitors out there by going to multitenant cloud platforms. David? Then we'll go next, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Toms (Analysts)】\nIt's David Toms from Numis. Can we just dig into the seasonality a little bit more for the forthcoming year? You talked about a degree of investment weighting to the first half. Can you just sort of tell us what you think the margin weighting is and also whether there might be any revenue weighting that's unusual within the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nYes, I think the signaling is more the investment from a margin perspective. Obviously, as we drive more to a recurring revenue model, it's very important, to state the obvious, that we get off to a good start because you can't catch up by selling perpetual licenses in the second half. So particularly around digital marketing, we're looking just to make sure that we have the appropriate level of investment to support what we're trying to do in FY '16. And we're just giving ourselves a little bit of room for maneuver in case we want to over-invest a little bit in the first half. I think in terms of the revenue, the revenue won't be particularly seasonal, so we're not signaling that there'll be any particular softness in the revenue in the first half, but we're reserving the ability to maybe be slightly under the margin if we so wish. The margin for the year as a whole will be fine, but it might be a bit more weighted to the front -- to the first half. It might not be. I'm not saying absolutely it will be, but we're reserving our rights, if you like.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nAnd I'm afraid we've got time for one more question, but I thank you for your patience waiting.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vijay Anand (Analysts)】\nIt's Vijay Anand from Mirabaud. My question is on the ASB revenue bridge. So looking at that bridge, the contribution from North America is still quite small relative to the size of the market. So could you talk about how you expect the subscription push, the sales and marketing investments to impact performance in this region? And is my understanding right that in order to get North America to grow in line with group average, i.e. 6%, you need more from new customers because you have a relatively small installed base there? So could you talk about that, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nI'll kick off, and then maybe Steve specifically. So in North America, we've done quite a lot of thing. And again, we signaled some changes to the management, leadership. And also, what was very successful, credit to Alvaro, is driving core product modernization in Europe. And I think the guys in France and the U.K. are benefiting from that today. So exposing the capability of on premise to the cloud, hybrid, Sage Drive; and really taking advantage of a subscriber model but all the benefits of the cloud as well. In essence, we've been doing that over the last 6 to 9 months in North America as well. So we launched something called Sage 100c and Sage 300; and again got, I wouldn't say raptures, but really positive feedback from the channel, the partners and the customers. And I see those sort of initiatives that we've taken where we made investments in FY '15 as revenue drivers because we're moving that all to the Growth products on subscription. So I would definitely see, in North America, one of the things you should watch for against the metrics, particularly around Customer for Life, is America picking up the pace as well regionally. And we've got some elements of the foundations in place of investments we made in FY '15 to make that a reality.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hare (Executives)】\nYes. I think the difference, if I can contrast between Europe and North America, is that before both Stephen and I were here, the European management team made a decision to invest in what's -- what we've called core product modernization. So they invested in the existing on-premise products like Sage 50, like Sage 100 in France. And what the European team are doing is using that now as a hook to switch existing customers to subscription by driving value. They're not going to customers and putting prices up. They're going to customers and saying, \"Here's features which improve productivity of your business, and it's available on subscription.\" Historically, we've called out previously, North America drove most of their growth through price and through upselling maintenance and support. So they just upsell through the various tiers. We have, of late, started to switch the investments to the appropriate place in North America, so we've launched Sage 100 and 300 cloud versions. And we are collaborating across border to launch Sage 50 Drive in the U.S., already launched in Canada. So what you'll see in the next sort of year or 2 is the North American business start to adopt a more, if I can use the phrase, European-style approach to driving value in the installed base. Why is Europe growing so strongly? Why has it got 75% recurring revenue mix? Because they're focused on their installed base. Actually, the new -- with the exception of Sage One, new customer acquisition is not taking off to the degree that it will need to in the next few years at the moment. The growth today is coming from successful management of the installed base. And the good news is 2/3 of the growth is coming from something other than price. What we should do is see North America start to grow more strongly as we see that coming through. And then the second thing is North America is being dragged by the payments business. North America is just over GBP 400 million of revenue. And GBP 100 million of that is payments processing, and that's not growing at the moment. So we see that coming through. I don't think we'll get back to double digit this year with payments processing in North America, but I do think it'll be mid- to high single digit, and that will also help to boost the growth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Kelly (Executives)】\nThat's great. And I think probably it's worth saying obviously, that the existing and installed customer base supports the baseline revenue growth case. And obviously, I think it's -- we've been together a year, the management team together a year. We've got a lot of execution to do in operations, but most of what we're talking about is just better sales and marketing execution. We've made the bets on the technology and we've made the investments. Now it's about following the lead and ensuring we really raise our bar in terms of capability of execution operationally.\r\nI'm really sorry we haven't got any more time for questions, but just we'll be around for a few minutes. We've got Anna Campopiano. And we've got Simon John, Investor Relations, so if there's anything you want to catch up with us offline, then please do so. And Simon's details, I think, are on the packs, so if there's any questions you've got, then do feel free to contact us.\r\nThank you very much for your support, and thank you for coming today.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you. Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex results for the interim 9 months 2015. I am Pablo Isla; and here with me today are Ignacio Fernández, our CFO; and Marcos López, Capital Markets Director. \r\nThe results for the interim 9 months 2015 show that Inditex continues its global multi-concept growth. We enjoy a global sales platform that fully integrates the stores and online and offers huge growth opportunities. Inditex operating performance in the period has been strong. Sales have increased 16%. We have achieved positive like-for-like sales growth in all geographical areas in the period. Our operations have also shown high efficiency and tight operating control over the period. As a result, EBIT has grown 20%. \r\nLet me also tell you that in terms of expansion, space growth and online launches for the year are on track. In terms of growth, we have maintained the strong pace of expansion. We have opened stores in 48 different markets over the period, demonstrating the global reach of Inditex business model. We have continued our global online rollout. We have a global presence and have further diversified our operations over the period. We continue to see significant growth opportunities for Inditex globally. \r\nThe year so far has been marked by very strong activity on many fronts. I would like to cover a number of recent initiatives carried out by Inditex. We are in a unique position as we enjoy a global sales platform that fully integrates stores and online as the best way to respond to the demands of our customers. This is a result of our highly differentiated business model, with a central inventory position, distribution to all our stores globally at least twice a week and orders received by our customers between 2 and 48 hours. This works perfectly in conjunction with our global online sales presence. We have a strong potential to continue expanding profitably in the coming years.\r\nLet me now hand over to Ignacio who will present some of the key aspects of our financial performance, and I will join you later for the outlook section.\n\n---\n\nThank you. In the interim 9 months of 2015, Inditex has had strong operating performance. All the key lines of the profit and loss account show significant growth. Net sales reached EUR 14.7 billion; EBITDA, EUR 3.3 billion; and net income, EUR 2 billion.\r\nIn the interim 9 months of 2015, sales have grown 15%. Like-for-like sales growth has been strong. Store and online launches for the year are on track. Gross profit has increased 16% to EUR 8.7 billion, resulting in 58.8% gross margin on sales. We have sustained our commercial policies over the period. \r\nOperating expenses are tightly under control. They have grown 15%, translating mainly to growth in space and sales. They include all the start-up costs for new openings. Operating working capital remains negative as a result of the business model. The working capital evolution is in line with the performance of the business. \r\nI will now hand over to Marcos who will elaborate on the performance of the Inditex concepts.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of the space addition and online launches, we are on track. Continuing with our global expansion, we have opened stores in 48 markets in the interim 9 months. Global online launches continue at a very rapid pace. \r\nRegarding the performance by concept in the interim 9 months 2015, Zara continues to represent approximately 2/3 of group sales; the younger concepts, around 1/3. The younger concepts, grouped together, have performed satisfactorily. I would like to highlight that Zara Home, Bershka and Stradivarius have performed very strongly. \r\nI will now hand over to Pablo for the outlook section.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Marcos. With respect to expansion in 2015, let me highlight that the space growth and online launches are on track. Ordinary capital expenditure for 2015 will be around EUR 1.35 billion. For the coming years, we continue to see strong growth opportunities, with capital expenditure growing below space growth. \r\nRegarding the outlook, I would like to add that the store and online sales in local currencies from the 1st of November to the 3rd of December have grown by 15%. Just as a reminder, we made our final 2015 dividend payment of EUR 809 million on the 3rd of November. \r\nWe will continue to invest in the expansion of our business across a number of markets, all of which offer attractive long-term returns to our sales platform that fully integrate stores and online. \r\nInditex is present on 5 continents and in all the key markets, demonstrating the group's global reach. We manage a diversified sales platform across 88 markets. The current base offers huge growth potential for the coming years. \r\nInditex online operations have seen very rapid growth in recent years. Our business model allows a swift expansion of our online sales globally. We have built an online sales presence in 21 European markets, the United States, China, the Russian Federation, Japan, South Korea, Mexico and Canada, the world's main economies. The concepts also have an established online sales presence in Europe. Additionally, some of the concepts are present in the United States and Australia. We will continue to roll out online sales progressively in all the markets in which we are present with stores. A step in this direction was the launch of Zara online sales in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau in the Autumn-Winter season. \r\nBefore closing, I would like to highlight some selected openings and commercial initiatives over recent months. Let me start with 2 very significant stores in the United States. We have reinforced significantly the differentiation of our key global flagships with very visible openings and enlargements. The first example is the Zara flagship store in New York at 222 Broadway. The store comprises 3,000 square meters in the landmark location by St. Paul's Chapel between the financial district and the Fulton Transit Center. Also, we opened our first store in Hawaii at Ala Moana Center in Honolulu yesterday. Zara has opened recently in Pavia, Corso Cavour of 3,000 square meters. Zara has also opened at Singapore's Changi Airport. We have opened a flagship store at Harbin's Hongbo Shopping Park. This is our 555th store in China. We continue expanding in Australia. Zara has opened a flagship store of 3,000 square meters in Brisbane's city center at Queen Street Mall. \r\nBershka is rolling out a new image with its launch in Taiwan. This is reflected in its flagship store in Taipei. Massimo Dutti has opened a flagship store in California at high-end South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. Pull&Bear has recently opened a flagship store of 1,000 square meters with its latest image at Hermosilla in Madrid. Stradivarius has continued updating its collection with an evening and party wear collection. \r\nOysho continues its global rollout, having launched recently in Sweden and South Korea. Oysho continues promoting yoga and sports events. The last notable date was Oysho's Yoga day in Shanghai with a huge level of participation. Zara Home recently launched in Australia, combining prominent flagships in Melbourne and Sydney with online sales. Zara Home has opened a very relevant store in Geneva's city center at rue de la Croix d'Or. Uterqüe has launched a special collection for the holiday season. \r\nTo close, we have recently enlarged 2 important Zara flagships: the store at Paseo del Borne in Palma de Mallorca to 3,000 square meters; and also the Zara flagship store in White City to 3,000 square meters. For all of you who live in London, we would definitely invite you to visit this remarkable store. \r\nRegarding our corporate calendar, the full-year results for 2015 will be released on the 9th of March, 2016. And this is all from us. We will be pleased to answer any questions you may have.",

      "transcript_text3": "Just had a question or questions on currency, please. I just wondered if you could comment on what you now estimate the currency impact on sales will be for the full year. And just again on currency, we have seen some fall in prices in markets like Mexico, closer to those in Spain for the same product. And I understand that that's mainly due to currency, but I wondered if you could also comment on any general sort of price convergence with Spain recently, and whether you expect that to continue into next year.\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you. About the first part of your question. Well, as you can imagine, we are not updating on a weekly basis everything which has to do with currencies because they are, all the time, moving and we prefer to focus much more on the execution of our business, managing our company and our like-for-like sales growth. Having said that, we are not changing what we transmitted in the month of September in the first half year results. For the full year, we are expecting something around a 0.5% positive currency impact on sales. And regarding the second part of your question. You know that -- the first thing I would like to say is that, of course, our like-for-like sales growth is volume driven, as it is always the case. And regarding prices in the different markets, we always take a long-term approach. What we can say is that currently, our price structure all across the world is flatter than ever. So the price harmonization is more than it has been ever, but the most relevant thing is that like-for-like sales growth is volume driven.\n\n---\n\nJust looking at your like-for-like, which just it's nicely outperforming the majority of the competition. What do you think the key drivers are of that like-for-like at present? Is it just a very strong fashion collection? Do you think you're benefiting from some sort of Euro tourism? Is there anything that you can sort of add to why this -- why you're performing so strongly at the like-for-like level?\n\n---\n\nYes. Thank you, Rebecca. I would say a combination of everything. Of course, it has to do with the collections; of course, it has to do with this fully integrated approach between stores and online; of course, it has to do with the way we operate the stores, with the refurbishments, the enlargements that we are developing; RFID. So it's a combination of a lot of things, and it's the execution of the business model. This is what summarizes everything; the execution of the business model. We are achieving positive like-for-like in the different geographies. And it's a combination of all the different elements which are involved in the management of the company.\n\n---\n\nLovely. And are you seeing an acceleration in terms of the like-for-like contribution from the online? I know that it's fully integrated, but clearly, the online allows you to extend your reach to new pockets of customers.\n\n---\n\nWell, what we can say is that we believe very much, as we always say, in this fully integrated approach between stores and online. Of course, online sales are growing. Online, for us, is relevant from 2 different points of view: one has to do with online sales; but the other one, as we have always mentioned, has to do with several million people every day seeing our apps, seeing our webpages, seeing the products. Some of them buying online, some of them buying in the stores. Fully integrated approach, in-store deliveries, in-store returns with the possibility to order online from the stores. So we believe very much in this fully integrated approach, and this is part of it -- of this like-for-like sales growth. But the way to summarize -- because there is not this impact or that impact on the other impact, is the execution of the business model.\n\n---\n\nFollowing up on Rebecca's question. Do you think the introduction of special prices at Zara, and also a wider range of product on the website, has helped to drive the like-for-like sales growth?\n\n---\n\nI couldn't try to find this or that reason. I come back to what I was saying before. When you have this strong like-for-like sales growth all across the different geographies and in a 9-month period, as we were talking about, it has to do with everything. So it is -- I come back to what I was saying before: it's the execution of the business model, the global management of the company.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And do you acknowledge that the range of product has been much expanded on the website?\n\n---\n\nSorry? I don't understand your question.\n\n---\n\nWe've seen a larger range of products on the website. So for example, more dresses compared to last year. Do you acknowledge that, that is the case?\n\n---\n\nNo, no, no. Perhaps it has to do with fashion trends. You can see in one season, fashion trends are more for dresses, another season are more for pants, so -- but no, no, no, we are not increasing the range of products globally.\n\n---\n\nI'm not sure I heard you right. You mentioned that CapEx growth might be below space growth. I'm not sure that I heard correctly. And if that is so, is this something for the short term or is this a new trend going forward?\n\n---\n\nYes, thank you. Well, this is something we already anticipated more or less 1 year ago, that the new trend of the business wants CapEx growth to be below space growth because CapEx is a combination of openings, refurbishments, and then you have logistics and IT. And during the period 2012 to 2014, we went through a very significant period of investments in logistics, in IT. So that is why we were saying that from this year on, so it is for 2015 and it will be for the coming years, CapEx growth will be below space growth. So this is going to be the trend of the business after 3 years, in which we were investing in a very significant way in logistics.\n\n---\n\nJust one on the gross margins. I was wondering in the third quarter, given the pressure there on the gross margin, if you could give a little bit more color, if not quantitatively, certainly qualitatively, in terms of markdowns, mix and currency. And presumably, you're still happy with your typical gross margin outlook, which is minus 50 to plus 50 basis points for the full year. But is there any reason why Q4 should be any better or worse than what you've seen in the third quarter?\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you. You know that we don't like to elaborate on the gross margin on a quarterly basis. We always say that, at least, you need to think about a full-season basis. And what we were anticipating to do in the month of December is that we were expecting a stable gross margin for the full year. What this means, we always say that for us, stable is plus-minus 50 basis points. We always work for the stability of the gross margin. The gross margin is a combination of many different things. Of course, it has to do with fashion trends, with the mix, with markups, markdowns, currencies. And what we were saying from the very beginning of this year is that this year, because of the dollar exchange rate, it -- regarding which, our exposure is relatively limited, too, because we have a certain level of natural hedging. But in any case, we were saying that it was going to be slightly positive in the first half and slightly negative in the second half. And then globally, a stable gross margin for the year, knowing that for us, stable because the gross margin is not mathematics. It has to do -- finally there is a figure, of course, but it has to do with many different things. So globally, we were saying that we were expecting a stable gross margin for the year, knowing that for us, stable means plus-minus 50 basis points. So there is nothing -- this Autumn-Winter season, we are having strong operating performance. And then considering all these elements together but having in mind this currency impact coming from the euro-dollar exchange rate, is why we were saying that we were expecting a slightly negative gross margin, so nothing really new to say compared to what we were seeing in the month of September.\n\n---\n\nOkay. But just to confirm, there's no reason to assume that currency pressure won't continue into the fourth quarter, right -- this year?\n\n---\n\nWell, basically, we work for the stability of the gross margin. I think that, basically, we should expect this confirmation of what we mentioned for the year, a broadly stable gross margin. And this is where we stand.\n\n---\n\nI've got a general question on China, just how you see the outlook there for the next 5 years. Clearly, the last 5 years has been a very strong growth story for you. Are there any signs of slower growth there? I'm thinking particularly of shopping center developments which might affect your rate of growth going forwards?\n\n---\n\nWell, what we can tell you is that, thinking about our company, we'd be -- of course, we are building a strong presence in China. We are having a very positive performance in the Chinese market with this fully integrated approach between stores and online. We continue opening stores in a significant way. And if we think about the next 5 years, our -- we'll continue growing in China. We have no doubts about the market. Fashion appetite is huge in the Chinese market. So we are growing. Our brands are becoming better and better known. We are having access to more and more customers every season, every year. So we continue feeling very optimistic about the evolution of our business in China in the next 5 years.\n\n---\n\nRight, okay. And store numbers, do you think you could open the same number of stores over the next 5 years as you've done in the previous 5?\n\n---\n\nYes. We will continue opening stores in a significant way in countries such as China. In 1 year or another, there could be a higher or lower number of store openings, because our approach to expansion is -- as anywhere else, it's a combination between high street locations. If you remember recently, we have opened a very prominent store in Shanghai, a very prominent store in Tianjin. We have enlarged a very relevant store in Beijing, in Xidan shopping center. So it's a combination between high street locations and then shopping malls. And then in any particular year, of course, there could be a little bit more, a little bit less shopping malls -- always been very demanding regarding where we go, we're we don't go. So in any case, a significant expansion in the coming years with this combination between store opening and online, this fully integrated approach.\n\n---\n\nMy question is about cash. We've seen, obviously, a big jump in the cash balance this year versus last year. And given your comments around CapEx growing slower than space growth, can you just remind us about how the board is thinking about that? And at what point that cash balance starts to be a problem for your return calculation?\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you. You know that we always update about this in the full year results presentation in the month of March. Our general policy remains the same. It's a combination. Our first priority, of course, is to invest in the long-term profitable growth of the company. But as far as we are generating strong cash flows, we combine this with what we consider an attractive and predictable shareholders' remuneration policy. We are increasing significantly the dividend. In fact, in the last 5 years, we have more than doubled the dividend. Our stated policy is a payout ratio of at least 50%. Last year, where the payout ratio was 63%. So this is the stated policy of the company. And then about each particular year, it is after the full-year -- knowing the full-year results and the Board that takes place in the month of March when we elaborate a little bit more and we update about our dividend policy. But the general policy is the one I have transmitted to you, so increasing regularly and progressively, the dividends. And as I was saying to you, we have more than doubled in a 5 years' period\n\n---\n\nA question about the space expansion. Could you tell us how many refurbs and store enlargements you've done this year? It's quite difficult to get a handle from that -- from the slides that you've given us, on exactly whether this is a sort of unusual year for either of those 2. And also, just update us on your guidance for net openings for the full year, please.\n\n---\n\nWell, Warwick, what we can mention is that in terms of openings and -- we are absolutely on track with the guidance we provided to you at the beginning of the year. Obviously, in the presentation, we selected some enlargements which we think are very relevant; is the case of White City in London and other store in Paseo del Borne in Mallorca because these are very, very relevant flagships. And I think that the main -- what we mentioned is -- what I can mention to you is that space growth remains totally on track. And the effort to make our stores more relevant and more prominent is an ongoing one. So there will always be some refurbishments. So everything is on track, and there is very little I can add on that.\n\n---\n\nSo your guidance is 320 to 380 net stores, I think. Can you give us an indication where you'll be within that range, given that you've only got another 6 weeks to go?\n\n---\n\nWe'll be within the range. This is what I can tell you. So we are very, very confident on the execution of the expansion plan.\n\n---\n\nWe have a number of questions received via the webcast platform. The first of which is in what online markets will Zara be launching in 2016?\n\n---\n\nWell, you know that we have built a strong presence in many different online markets. In fact, in 2015, today in Europe, we are present in 22 European markets. And one thing that we are planning to do next year regarding Zara and the other brands is to be -- to launch online in all the European markets in which we are still not present.\n\n---\n\nThe second question received on the webcast platform is Stradivarius is launching a men's collection. When will this take place?\n\n---\n\nWe are planning to do it in the year 2017. So this is the approach we have. We are preparing the teams. We are beginning to work on the collections and this idea of incorporating men's clothing into Stradivarius is part of our strategy to complete our commercial offer. In fact, it's something that we are doing in many different concepts. For example, Massimo Dutti has launched their personal tailoring offering; or for example, Oysho, with their sports and gym collection that we decided to launch 2 years ago; Zara Home, with a big development of the cosmetics collection. So this is part of a permanent approach in terms of completing our commercial offering with the different concepts.\n\n---\n\nThe final question that we received on the webcast platform relates to payment. Are your stores ready to take payment by phone at the cash register in-store?\n\n---\n\nWell, yes. In fact, there are markets where you can pay by mobile at the cash register right now in our stores. This is the case in the United States. This is the case in the U.K. This is the case in Spain. Our idea is to roll out this technology in all the different markets. It's not a big issue; it's quite simple to introduce this possibility of a payment by phone in all our stores in the world. So there is no big issue about that.\n\n---\n\nI can see from looking at the webcast platform, there are no further questions. So I think we'll conclude there. Thank you very much for joining us today, and that concludes the results presentation.\n\n---\n\nYes, well, thank you very much. And in any case, of course, through our Capital Markets Department, we are ready to answer any additional questions you may have about these results. Thank you very much for joining us today.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Richard Chamberlain (Analysts)】\nJust had a question or questions on currency, please. I just wondered if you could comment on what you now estimate the currency impact on sales will be for the full year. And just again on currency, we have seen some fall in prices in markets like Mexico, closer to those in Spain for the same product. And I understand that that's mainly due to currency, but I wondered if you could also comment on any general sort of price convergence with Spain recently, and whether you expect that to continue into next year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, thank you. About the first part of your question. Well, as you can imagine, we are not updating on a weekly basis everything which has to do with currencies because they are, all the time, moving and we prefer to focus much more on the execution of our business, managing our company and our like-for-like sales growth. Having said that, we are not changing what we transmitted in the month of September in the first half year results. For the full year, we are expecting something around a 0.5% positive currency impact on sales. And regarding the second part of your question. You know that -- the first thing I would like to say is that, of course, our like-for-like sales growth is volume driven, as it is always the case. And regarding prices in the different markets, we always take a long-term approach. What we can say is that currently, our price structure all across the world is flatter than ever. So the price harmonization is more than it has been ever, but the most relevant thing is that like-for-like sales growth is volume driven.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nJust looking at your like-for-like, which just it's nicely outperforming the majority of the competition. What do you think the key drivers are of that like-for-like at present? Is it just a very strong fashion collection? Do you think you're benefiting from some sort of Euro tourism? Is there anything that you can sort of add to why this -- why you're performing so strongly at the like-for-like level?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nYes. Thank you, Rebecca. I would say a combination of everything. Of course, it has to do with the collections; of course, it has to do with this fully integrated approach between stores and online; of course, it has to do with the way we operate the stores, with the refurbishments, the enlargements that we are developing; RFID. So it's a combination of a lot of things, and it's the execution of the business model. This is what summarizes everything; the execution of the business model. We are achieving positive like-for-like in the different geographies. And it's a combination of all the different elements which are involved in the management of the company.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nLovely. And are you seeing an acceleration in terms of the like-for-like contribution from the online? I know that it's fully integrated, but clearly, the online allows you to extend your reach to new pockets of customers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, what we can say is that we believe very much, as we always say, in this fully integrated approach between stores and online. Of course, online sales are growing. Online, for us, is relevant from 2 different points of view: one has to do with online sales; but the other one, as we have always mentioned, has to do with several million people every day seeing our apps, seeing our webpages, seeing the products. Some of them buying online, some of them buying in the stores. Fully integrated approach, in-store deliveries, in-store returns with the possibility to order online from the stores. So we believe very much in this fully integrated approach, and this is part of it -- of this like-for-like sales growth. But the way to summarize -- because there is not this impact or that impact on the other impact, is the execution of the business model.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anne Critchlow (Analysts)】\nFollowing up on Rebecca's question. Do you think the introduction of special prices at Zara, and also a wider range of product on the website, has helped to drive the like-for-like sales growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nI couldn't try to find this or that reason. I come back to what I was saying before. When you have this strong like-for-like sales growth all across the different geographies and in a 9-month period, as we were talking about, it has to do with everything. So it is -- I come back to what I was saying before: it's the execution of the business model, the global management of the company.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anne Critchlow (Analysts)】\nOkay. And do you acknowledge that the range of product has been much expanded on the website?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nSorry? I don't understand your question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anne Critchlow (Analysts)】\nWe've seen a larger range of products on the website. So for example, more dresses compared to last year. Do you acknowledge that, that is the case?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nNo, no, no. Perhaps it has to do with fashion trends. You can see in one season, fashion trends are more for dresses, another season are more for pants, so -- but no, no, no, we are not increasing the range of products globally.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ignacio Romero (Analysts)】\nI'm not sure I heard you right. You mentioned that CapEx growth might be below space growth. I'm not sure that I heard correctly. And if that is so, is this something for the short term or is this a new trend going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nYes, thank you. Well, this is something we already anticipated more or less 1 year ago, that the new trend of the business wants CapEx growth to be below space growth because CapEx is a combination of openings, refurbishments, and then you have logistics and IT. And during the period 2012 to 2014, we went through a very significant period of investments in logistics, in IT. So that is why we were saying that from this year on, so it is for 2015 and it will be for the coming years, CapEx growth will be below space growth. So this is going to be the trend of the business after 3 years, in which we were investing in a very significant way in logistics.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Steegers (Analysts)】\nJust one on the gross margins. I was wondering in the third quarter, given the pressure there on the gross margin, if you could give a little bit more color, if not quantitatively, certainly qualitatively, in terms of markdowns, mix and currency. And presumably, you're still happy with your typical gross margin outlook, which is minus 50 to plus 50 basis points for the full year. But is there any reason why Q4 should be any better or worse than what you've seen in the third quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, thank you. You know that we don't like to elaborate on the gross margin on a quarterly basis. We always say that, at least, you need to think about a full-season basis.

But just to confirm, there's no reason to assume that currency pressure won't continue into the fourth quarter, right -- this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nWell, basically, we work for the stability of the gross margin. I think that, basically, we should expect this confirmation of what we mentioned for the year, a broadly stable gross margin. And this is where we stand.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Hughes (Analysts)】\nI've got a general question on China, just how you see the outlook there for the next 5 years.
