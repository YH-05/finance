      "content": "<p>A 14,400-year-old wolf puppy’s last meal is shedding light on the last days of one of the Ice Age’s most iconic megafauna species, the woolly rhinoceros.</p>\n<p>When researchers dissected the frozen mummified remains of an Ice Age wolf puppy, they found a partially digested chunk of meat in its stomach: the remnants of the puppy’s last meal 14,400 years ago. DNA testing revealed that the meat was a prime cut of woolly rhinoceros, a now-extinct 2-metric-ton behemoth that once stomped across the tundras of Europe and Asia. Stockholm University paleogeneticist Sólveig Guðjónsdóttir and her colleagues recently sequenced a full genome from the piece of meat, which reveals some secrets about woolly rhino populations in the centuries before their extinction.</p>\n<img alt=\"photo of a mummified wolf corpse being dissected by two people.\" class=\"none large\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Autopsy-of-Tumat-1024x576.jpg\" width=\"1024\" />\n      Scientists carefully autopsy the remains of a wolf puppy who lived and died 14,400 years ago near Tumat village in Siberia.\n        Credit:\n          Guðjónsdóttir et al. 2026\n      \n<h2><b>One bad day for a rhino, one giant leap for paleogenomics</b></h2>\n<p>“Sequencing the entire genome of an Ice Age animal found in the stomach of another animal has never been done before,” said Uppsala University paleogeneticist Camilo Chacón-Duque, a co-author of the study, in a recent press release.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/scientists-sequence-a-woolly-rhino-genome-from-a-14400-year-old-wolfs-stomach/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/scientists-sequence-a-woolly-rhino-genome-from-a-14400-year-old-wolfs-stomach/#comments\">Comments</a></p>",

In general, the more information you feed into a generative AI, the better the outputs are. And when that data is personal to you, the resulting inference is theoretically more useful. Google just so happens to have a lot of personal data on all its users, so it's relatively simple to feed that data into Gemini.</p>\n<p>As Personal Intelligence rolls out over the coming weeks, AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers will see the option to connect those data sources. Each can be connected individually, so you might choose to allow Gmail access but block Photos, for example. When Gemini is allowed access to other Google products, it incorporates that data into its responses.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/gemini-can-now-scan-your-photos-email-and-more-to-provide-better-answers/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/gemini-can-now-scan-your-photos-email-and-more-to-provide-better-answers/#comments\">Comments</a></p>",
