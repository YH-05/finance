That's why a pet Swiss brown cow in Austria named Veronika has caused a bit of a sensation: she likes to pick up random sticks and use them to scratch herself. According to a <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(25)01597-0\">new paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology, this is a form of multipurpose tool use and suggests that the cognitive capabilities of cows have been underestimated by scientists.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/11/parrot-in-captivity-manufactures-tools-something-not-seen-in-the-wild/\">previously reported</a>, tool use was once thought to be one of the defining features of humans, but examples of it were eventually observed in primates and other mammals. Dolphins can toss objects as a form of play, which some scientists consider to be a type of tool use, particularly when it involves another member of the same species. Potential purposes include a means of communication, social bonding, or aggressiveness. (Octopuses have also <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/11/take-that-octopuses-caught-on-camera-vigorously-throwing-debris-at-each-other/\">been observed</a> engaging in similar throwing behavior.)</p>\n<p>But the biggest surprise came when birds were observed using tools in the wild. After all, birds are the only surviving dinosaurs, and mammals and dinosaurs hadn’t shared a common ancestor for hundreds of millions of years.

Interestingly, today's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/how-do-ai-coding-agents-work-we-look-under-the-hood/\">AI coding agents</a> feel much the same way.</p>\n<p>Since November, I have used <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/claude-code-gets-a-web-version-but-its-the-new-sandboxing-that-really-matters/\">Claude Code</a> and Claude Opus 4.5 through a personal Claude Max account to extensively experiment with AI-assisted software development (I have also used OpenAI's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/how-openai-is-using-gpt-5-codex-to-improve-the-ai-tool-itself/\">Codex</a> in a similar way, though not as frequently).

This opinion comes not as an endorsement but as personal experience: I voluntarily undertook this project, and I paid out of pocket for both OpenAI and Anthropic's premium AI plans.</p>\n<p>Throughout my life, I have dabbled in programming as a utilitarian coder, writing small tools or scripts when needed. In my web development career, I wrote some small tools from scratch, but I primarily modified other people's code for my needs. Since 1990, I've programmed in BASIC, C, Visual Basic, PHP, ASP, Perl, Python, Ruby, MUSHcode, and some others. I am not an expert in any of these languages—I learned just enough to get the job done. I have developed my own hobby games over the years using BASIC, Torque Game Engine, and Godot, so I have some idea of what makes a good architecture for a modular program that can be expanded over time.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/10-things-i-learned-from-burning-myself-out-with-ai-coding-agents/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/10-things-i-learned-from-burning-myself-out-with-ai-coding-agents/#comments\">Comments</a></p>",

Personal intelligence is beginning as a feature for paid users, and it's entirely optional.</p>\n<p>By every measure, Google's models are at or near the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/11/google-unveils-gemini-3-ai-model-and-ai-first-ide-called-antigravity/\">top of the AI heap</a>. In general, the more information you feed into a generative AI, the better the outputs are. And when that data is personal to you, the resulting inference is theoretically more useful. Google just so happens to have a lot of personal data on all its users, so it's relatively simple to feed that data into Gemini.</p>\n<p>As Personal Intelligence rolls out over the coming weeks, AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers will see the option to connect those data sources. Each can be connected individually, so you might choose to allow Gmail access but block Photos, for example. When Gemini is allowed access to other Google products, it incorporates that data into its responses.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/gemini-can-now-scan-your-photos-email-and-more-to-provide-better-answers/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/gemini-can-now-scan-your-photos-email-and-more-to-provide-better-answers/#comments\">Comments</a></p>",

Front seat passengers now find themselves with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/08/ai-good-passenger-infotainment-screens-bad-says-car-technology-survey/\">their own infotainment screen</a>, often with some kind of active filter tech to prevent the driver from being distracted by whatever it is they're doing. And of course <em>le buzz du jour</em>, AI, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/in-car-ai-assistant-coming-to-fords-and-lincolns-in-2027/\">is being crammed in</a> here, there, and everywhere.</p>\n<p>But the thing about fashion and trends is that they don't remain in style forever. For a few years, it was hard to drive a new car that didn't use piano black trim all over the interior.
