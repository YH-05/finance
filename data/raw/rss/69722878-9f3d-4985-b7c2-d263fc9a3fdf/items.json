With a single dial, you skip forward or backward through a Spotify playlist, then press it to pause or play. On a standard Stream Deck, you’d need multiple buttons to do the same thing. Elgato also includes “Dial Stacks,” which let each dial handle multiple functions you can cycle through. A slim touchscreen above the dials shows what each control is currently assigned to and lets you swipe between different pages within a profile. And while the touchscreen itself can’t trigger plug-ins like the regular buttons, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24290619/the-stream-deck-plus-is-ready-to-get-dialed-in?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Elgato’s since released software updates</a>  that let you assign up to three standard button or plugin actions to each dial, making the Stream Deck Plus far more useful than it was at launch.</p>",

Locked yourself out? Need to let a friend in to water the plants? Your latchkey kid lost their key? Hands are full, and it’s raining cats and dogs? A smart lock solves all of these problems and more.</p>\n\n<p>One of the best smart home upgrades you can make, a smart lock gives you remote control access to your house from anywhere, plus easy, key-free ways to unlock and lock your door. Smart locks also remember everything that happened, so they can tell you when your door was unlocked, and sometimes who did it.</p>\n\n<p>For most people, control and convenience are big enough selling points. However, smart locks also work nicely with other smart home devices, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22954554/best-video-doorbell-camera\">video doorbells</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23156554/smart-bulbs-switch-lighting-guide-how-to\">smart lighting</a>. My favorite way to integrate locks in my home is with an evening&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23749376/smart-home-explained-voice-assistant-tv-gadgets\">smart home</a>&nbsp;routine, which locks the doors, dims the lights, and sets my thermostat to sleep mode. We have four exterior doors, so it saves me from walking around the house at night checking everything is secure.</p>\n\n<p>Having a connected lock on your door is as secure as a standard lock, and sometimes more. Most smart locks have the same security ratings as their non-smart counterparts (see <a href=\"#smart-lock-faqs-1\">FAQ</a> for more details), and it&#8217;s harder to physically pick a lock without a keyway. Plus, any smart lock is more secure than leaving a spare key under a flowerpot.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been testing smart door locks for six years and have installed more than 30 for this guide alone. Here are my top picks for your front door. Whether you want the best of the best, don&#8217;t want to replace your existing lock, are on a budget, or want a smart lock that doesn&#8217;t look like a smart lock, there are great options for every need.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"best-smart-lock\">Best smart lock</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Kwikset Halo Select</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/8A0A3419.jpeg?w=300\" width=\"300\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Excellent auto-unlock function</li><li>Choice of Wi-Fi or Matter-over-Thread</li><li>Great design</li><li>Discreet door sensor</li><li>Can be rekeyed</li><li></li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Have to choose between Thread and Kwikset’s auto-unlock</li><li>No Home Key or biometric access</li><li>Touchscreen shows fingerprints</li><li>Prominent Kwikset branding</li><li></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJPT8KN9\"> <strike>$259</strike> $233.1 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/pep/Kwikset-HALO-Select-Touchscreen-Wi-Fi-and-Matter-Enabled-Smart-Lock-Deadbolt-in-Matte-Black-9800-WIFI-THRD-TSCR-514/332397488\"> <strike>$259</strike> $233.1 at <strong>Home Depot</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lowes.com/pd/Kwikset-Halo-Select-Satin-Nickel-Wifi-Single-Cylinder-Smartkey-Electronic-Deadbolt-with-Lighted-Keypad-Touchscreen/5015296445\"> $259 at <strong>Lowes</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Connectivity:</em></strong><em> Wi-Fi, Thread / </em><strong><em>Access options:</em></strong><em> Key, keycode, app, voice / </em><strong><em>Auto-unlock:</em></strong><em> Yes / </em><strong><em>Battery type:</em></strong><em> Four AA batteries / </em><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong><em> Six to 12 months / </em><strong><em>Guest codes:</em></strong><em> Yes / </em><strong><em>Security rating: </em></strong><em>ANSI Grade AAA / </em><strong><em>Works with: </em></strong><em>Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant</em>, <em>Matter (including Apple Home, Samsung SmartThings)</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24273662/kwikset-halo-select-new-smart-lock-matter-thread-wifi\">Kwikset Halo Select</a> is a good-looking, reliable smart lock with top-notch security ratings, broad smart home compatibility, and the best auto-unlock function I’ve tested to date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I strongly believe a smart lock should look good on your door, and the Halo Select does exactly that, plus it can blend in with both traditional and contemporary door sets. (But I could do without the prominent Kwikset branding.)</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/8A0A3413-1.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,8.3333333333333,100,83.333333333333\" title=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of the four entry methods — a keyway (which is <a href=\"https://www.kwikset.com/smartkey-security\">re-keyable</a>), a touchscreen keypad, app/smart home control, and auto-unlock by location — I liked the last one the best. It worked so well that I didn’t mind that it lacks a fingerprint reader or Apple Home Key.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My experience with automatic unlocking on other locks (which uses a combination of Bluetooth, GPS, and Wi-Fi to determine your location) has been generally frustrating, but on the Halo Select, it’s been flawless. It unlocks just as I approach my porch, making coming home and opening the door a virtually hands-free experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Select can also auto-lock based on your location, not just after a set amount of time, as most locks offer. I also like the Halo Select’s LED lock indicator on the touchscreen, which tells you at a glance if the door is locked or unlocked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Halo Select has built-in Wi-Fi and a Thread radio, but you have to pick one. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you set it up with Wi-Fi, you can use the Kwikset app and connect to Amazon Alexa and Google via the cloud. With Matter, you can connect to those platforms locally and also to Apple Home and others, but you won’t be able to use the Kwikset app after setup, so you lose the auto-unlock feature, among others.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Kwikset’s auto-unlock feature worked flawlessly in testing</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Matter-over-Thread does promise better battery life — and long-term testing bears this out — as well as the ability to easily share the lock with other ecosystems. I set it up in Apple Home, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings via Matter with no issues and could control it with all three via routines, automations, and voice commands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a shame to have to choose between using Matter and some of this lock’s best features, but this is a problem across Matter, not specific to Kwikset.

It’s Bluetooth-only (unless you also buy its compatible video doorbell to act as a Wi-Fi bridge), so the battery lasts over a year. At under $80, it’s the best budget lock we tested.</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img alt=\"A keypad door lock on a door\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24050206/226293_SMART_LOCK_BUYING_GUIDE_jtuohy_0020.jpg?w=300\" width=\"300\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Inexpensive </li><li>Good fingerprint reader</li><li>Offline access codes</li><li>Long battery life</li><li></li></ul></td><td><ul><li>No Wi-Fi </li><li>No smart home support</li><li>Large rear housing</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/pep/Wyze-Smart-Lock-Fingerprint-Keyless-Entry-Bluetooth-Deadbolt-Replacement-In-App-Monitoring-and-Scheduled-Access-WLCKB1/320791492\"> <strike>$79.98</strike> $65.75 at <strong>Home Depot</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fingerprint-Bluetooth-Replacement-Weatherproof-Scheduled/dp/B0BMZMF26G\"> <strike>$79.98</strike> $65.75 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.wyze.com/products/wyze-lock-bolt/\"> $79.98 at <strong>Wyze</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth 5.0  / <strong>Access options:</strong> Fingerprint, keypad, app / <strong>Auto-unlock:</strong> No / <strong>Battery type: </strong>Four AA batteries  / <strong>Battery life:</strong> One year / <strong>Security Grade:</strong> ANSI/BHMA Grade 3 / <strong>Guest codes:</strong> Yes / <strong>Works with:</strong> N/A</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The Wyze Lock Bolt is a good choice if you want something inexpensive and useful and don’t care about smart home integration — or prefer a lock without it. It’s not sleek or stylish; it’s just a big hunk of black plastic (there’s also a satin nickel version). Out of the box, it doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi or integrate with any smart home systems, but it does have an easy-to-use backlit keypad and a lightning-fast fingerprint reader. It’ll auto-lock if you want, and it’s half the price of most smart locks in this list.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24745153/8A0A6570.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" title=\"\" />\n<p>In addition to the fingerprint reader and keypad, the Wyze Lock Bolt can be controlled over Bluetooth, and its range is very good. I could lock the door from my bedroom at the other end of the house using the Wyze app. That’s important, as there’s no way to lock the door on a schedule (although you can enable auto-lock).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignleft\"><blockquote><p>The Wyze doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi or integrate with any smart home systems </p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p>The Bolt doesn’t integrate with smart home platforms, but if you don’t need to control your lock with your voice or plan to add it to any smart home routines, you won’t miss those features. It also delivers up to a year of battery life on four AAs — I tested it for three months and it only lost 15 percent.</p>\n\n<p>But without Wi-Fi, I couldn’t check on it or control it when I was away from home, so turning on the auto-lock option is a must. If I wanted to let someone in while I was gone, I couldn’t unlock the door remotely, but I could generate an offline code in the Wyze app and share that. This uses similar technology to two-factor authentication codes and worked perfectly in my testing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Since I tested the lock, Wyze has introduced an integration with its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22915876/wyze-video-doorbell-pro-review-budget-doorbell-camera\">Wyze Video Doorbell Pro </a>that lets you unlock the Bolt remotely when paired with the doorbell — but it doesn’t let you lock it remotely, which is odd. Of course, if you enable auto-lock, this is less of an issue.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"54sqA6\">Best retrofit smart lock</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Nuki Smart Lock</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">Nuki Smart Lock</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/257834_Nuki_Smart_Lock_JTuohy_0006.jpg?w=300\" width=\"300\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 9</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Lightning fast</li><li>Nice, compact design</li><li>Simple to install</li><li>Supports Wi-Fi <em>and</em> Matter over Thread</li><li>No account required</li><li>Broad smart home compatibility</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>No Apple Home Key</li><li>Proprietary charging cable</li><li>No door sensor included</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Keyless-Electronic-Deadbolt-Auto-Unlock-Installation/dp/B0F7HKRWNV\"> $199 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://nuki.io/en-us/products/smart-lock?chooser=true&#038;sku=US-221146\"> $199 at <strong>Nuki</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><em><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Matter-over-Thread / <strong>Access options:</strong> Key, app, voice, fingerprint and keypad (sold separately) /  <strong>Auto-unlock:</strong> Yes / <strong>Battery type: </strong>Non-removable, rechargeable / <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 12 months / <strong>Guest codes:</strong> Yes / <strong>Works with: </strong>Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Home, Samsung SmartThings</em></em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Nuki Smart Lock is the most advanced retrofit smart lock we’ve tested, and a worthy replacement for our previous pick, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082VXRND2/\">August Wi-Fi Smart Lock</a>. It features a compact design and lightning-fast locking — even quicker than manually turning the lock — and it works over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24313084/smart-lock-home-preview-2025-matter-apple\">Matter over Thread</a>, the latter of which enables out-of-home control and notifications through any Matter-compatible smart home platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whereas most smart locks feature a big, bulky design, the Nuki Smart Lock boasts a minimalist style with a premium look and feel. Installation is straightforward — simply remove the thumbturn from your existing deadbolt, replace it with a blackplate, and snap the Nuki into place. Once it’s installed, you can get up and running without signing up for an account, which is a rare feature for a smart lock.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/257834_Nuki_Smart_Lock_JTuohy_0009.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" title=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Nuki app gives you access to multiple settings and customization options. In addition to standard features like key sharing with family members and enabling auto-lock and auto-unlock, it supports schedules, an activity log, and a convenient Night Mode, which can lock the door at a set time, disable auto-unlock, and enable auto-lock.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you don’t have a Matter hub and a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23823041/matter-thread-device-setup-smart-home-how-to\">Thread border router</a> — like a HomePod — Nuki’s Premium service provides remote access, lock activity notifications, and integration with rental platforms like Airbnb. Nuki Premium was previously offered as a monthly subscription, but as of December 3rd, 2025, the cost is now folded into the purchase of each lock. That means the Nuki Smart Lock is now more expensive up front at $199 (up from $159); however, the good news is that premium features are no longer behind a paywall. Those who already have Nuki Premium will also be able to continue using the premium features for the lifetime of the product without an added fee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, Nuki offers an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7HLSQCG/\">optional keypad</a>, which supports both PIN codes and fingerprints, making it easy for friends, family, and guests to gain access without needing to download an app. Although the fingerprint reader works well, there is no backlight, making nighttime use tricky without a porch light. The current keypad doesn’t support Apple Home Key, though Nuki is planning to release one with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/603957/uwb-hands-free-unlocking-schlage-aliro-apple-samsung-hands-on?gclid=Cj0KCQjwjo7DBhCrARIsACWauSlNtfG8MdSub86eRemLyhXGwTJDBlJocAHan9rW73u3L3JsAARDL_caAqYPEALw_wcB&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA9k5E7D4IShVDiE_Pj3tXHaohe7KM\">ultra-wideband unlocking (UWB)</a> and NFC support.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nuki’s smart lock has a built-in battery that can last for months, and it only takes a few hours to fully recharge. While a non-removable battery raises concerns about longevity — smart locks generally use AA batteries — Nuki claims it should last 10 years. After that, the company says a replacement plan will be offered.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"0OPJqL\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/smart-home-review/695965/nuki-smart-lock-review\">Read our review of the Nuki Smart Lock</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"yynwaS\">Best smart lock for renters</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Yale Approach Lock with Wi-Fi</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">This slimline, easy-to-install, inexpensive retrofit lock is a simple solution with a year of battery life.

It’s super easy to install, looks nice, and has a good list of features — auto-lock, auto-unlock, app and voice control. Add the Bluetooth keypad to get one-touch locking, key code, and fingerprint access.</p>\n\n<p>The Approach replaces your thumb turn, so you can still use your current lock and key — making it a great option if you are renting and don’t want to annoy your landlord. It has a nice, slim profile and blends in better than the rear housing of most smart locks.</p>\n\n<p>The lock comes in black or silver and took me less than five minutes to install. It uses four AA batteries and promises 12 months of battery life. This is because there is no built-in Wi-Fi; instead, it uses an included plug-in bridge.</p>\n\n<p>The bridge adds out-of-home control and connection to smart home platforms, including Alexa and Google Home, but there’s no Apple Home support). This allows for voice control and adding it to smart home routines. Yale told me there’s an onboard <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/11/24126764/yale-approach-smart-lock-price-release-date-specs#:~:text=Daviau%20also%20said,with%20Matter%20later.%E2%80%9D\">Thread radio</a> that will be activated to support Matter, but didn’t say when this would arrive.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25658974/8A0A1825.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" title=\"\" />\n<p>The optional Bluetooth keypad lets you control the lock from the outside without using an app or key, and it worked promptly and reliably. There’s the option of a fingerprint version, and that was similarly a good experience — just touch and open. The keypad also allows you to lock the door when you leave by pressing the Yale logo button. </p>\n\n<p>The keys are a bit sensitive; I frequently get double inputs when pressing. But I liked the LED indicator that notifies you with green if your code was accepted or red if there’s an issue. This made it easy to know if the input worked, as the lock is very quiet — it’s hard to hear it locking or unlocking.</p>\n\n<p>My biggest disappointment is the look of the keypad. It’s big, wide, and black, with prominent white numbers that don’t disappear when not in use — it looks a bit like a toy keypad on your door.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"CMVNGj\">Best fingerprint smart lock</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">This fingerprint lock is fast and reliable, and the keypad is a good backup option for visitors.

There’s an option with or without a keyway, with a touchscreen keypad or a physical keypad, or with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Yale-Assure-Lock-Apple-Wi-Fi/dp/B0CBNF2M6F?tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=___vg__p_23131505__t_w__r_https://www.theverge.com/23393163/best-smart-door-lock__d_D\">Apple Home Key</a>, but my favorite model is the Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with a built-in fingerprint reader. It costs $279.99, and the built-in fingerprint reader is fast and efficient. I tested the touchscreen version, but Yale recently released <a href=\"https://shopyalehome.com/pages/yale-assure-lock-2-touch\">a keypad version</a>. Unless you really value the clean look of the touchscreen (which is blank when off), go with the keypad — it’s much easier to use.</p>\n\n<p>The Yale Assure 2 is a good-looking lock that works with every smart home platform with its swappable modules. Its slimline design (both front and back), wide smart home compatibility, easy-to-use app, and good selection of unlocking options — including fingerprint unlock — make it a great option for your front door.&nbsp;</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/236819_Yale_Assure_Lock_2_JTuohy_0004.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" title=\"\" />\n<p>The lock supports Bluetooth out of the box and works with the Yale Access app and Apple Home app (which adds remote unlocking if you have an Apple Home hub). Along with a keycode, fingerprint reader, or key, you can also choose to use auto-unlocking. Auto-unlock is a decent alternative to fingerprint unlock, but I found I often had to wait at the door for a second or two before it worked. Still, it’s faster than fumbling through a purse for keys when your hands are full.</p>\n\n<p>Support for other platforms and remote unlocking comes through Yale’s ingenious swappable networking modules, which cost around $80 each. There’s a Wi-Fi module to add Alexa and Google Home integration and a <a href=\"https://www.yalehome.com/us/en/stories/news/z-wave-now-available-with-yale-assure-lock--2\">Z-Wave module</a> for compatibility with (some) SmartThings hubs, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22798830/ring-alarm-pro-review-smart-home-security-alexa\">Ring Alarm</a>, and other Z-Wave hubs. Yale promised support for Matter via a Matter-over-Thread module back in 2022, but this <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23891513/yale-assure-lock-2-touch-fingerprint-plus-homekey#:~:text=When%20we%20first,for%20early%20adopters.\">still hasn’t materialized</a>.

While it won’t be updated to support Matter, the Thread radio adds better battery life and a more stable connection to Apple Home than Bluetooth. I have had numerous connectivity issues in HomeKit with Bluetooth-only locks.</p>\n\n<p>To use Home Key, you need to have an Apple Home Hub, such as an Apple TV or HomePod. Adding the lock to the Home app automatically adds the Home Key card to your Wallet, as well as that of anyone else you have added to your Apple Home. That’s much easier than getting household members to download a whole new app for the door lock. I should know — I try regularly. </p>\n\n<p>To allow someone not in your household to control the lock, you’ll have to give them a standard PIN, which you can do in the Apple Home app or the Schlage Encode app. If you like, you can set this lock up entirely in the Home app and never have to use the manufacturer’s app.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"q0sOzQ\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22964521/schlage-smart-lock-review-encode-plus-apple-home-key-test\">Read our review of the Schlage Encode Plus</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"qBu5u5\">Best smart lock that doesn’t look like a smart lock</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Level Lock Pro</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Level_Lock_Pro_Exterior_Nickel_1.jpg?w=300\" width=\"300\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>No branding</li><li>Small and unobtrusive</li><li>Supports Home Key</li><li>Works over Thread</li><li>Broad smart home compatibility through Matter</li><li>Door sense</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Keypad costs extra</li><li>Auto-unlock can be unreliable</li><li>Not ideal for older doors</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://level.co/products/level-lock/pro/\"> $349 at <strong>Level</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><span><em><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, Thread, Wi-Fi with bridge / <strong>Access options:</strong> Key, app, voice, keypad (sold separately), Apple Home Key / <strong>Auto-unlock:</strong> Yes / <strong>Battery type:</strong> One CR2 batter</em><i>y / </i><strong>Battery life:</strong><i> 12 months / </i><strong>Guest codes:</strong><i> Yes / </i><strong><i>Works with: </i></strong></span><em>Matter, </em><span><i>Apple Home</i></span><em>, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings</em></p>\n\n<p>If you don’t want a smart lock that <em>looks</em> like a smart lock, there’s the Level Lock Pro.

The newer model features an upgraded processor, Matter-over-Thread support, a passive infrared sensor for presence detection, and a built-in door sensor to tell you if the door is open or closed, not just locked.

You can unlock the Lock Pro with a regular key, Apple Home Key, the Level app, voice control, auto-unlock, or a touch-to-unlock mode. We found the auto-unlock feature to be finicky at times, though, and the installation can be a headache on older doors.

This type of lock is traditionally found on interior doors, pedestrian doors into garages, or side doors.</p>\n\n<p>There are options for smart lever locks from <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/yale-assure-lock-smart-lock-wi-fi-lever-with-touchscreen-keypad--key-access-black-suede/6563911.p?skuId=6563911&amp;extStoreId=1120&amp;utm_source=feed&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=19626625157&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwpP63BhDYARIsAOQkATYez6qqP87kqpgI7KxulDSAaGklzF8tVZdPR-8cgKceOAcRZINDPVgaApWuEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Yale</a>, <a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/p/Schlage-Century-Satin-Nickel-Electronic-Encode-Smart-WiFi-Latitude-Lever-with-Alarm-FE789WB-CEN-619-LAT/325030973?irgwc=1&amp;cm_mmc=afl-ir-78091-456723-&amp;clickid=WiW1Dq3bRxyIWUpT3wROLUykUkCUB3wVyQbsxU0\">Schlage</a>, and <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flockly.com%2Fproducts%2Flockly-secure-plus\">Lockly</a>, but the U300 is the only one with Home Key compatibility and a built-in fingerprint reader. It also works over Thread and supports Matter.</p>\n\n<p>I installed it on my garage door, and it works like a charm. The fingerprint reader is right where you put your thumb to open the door, so I barely notice it unlocking as I walk in. It also has a keypad, and I can use my iPhone or Apple Watch for Home Key. It’s set to auto-lock by default, but you can enable passage mode directly on the lock if you don’t want it to stay locked all the time.</p>\n\n<p>It paired to Matter easily — I set it up in Apple Home and could add a code and Home Key all without even opening the Aqara app. Because it uses Thread, there’s no need for an Aqara hub. Thread also enables up to 10 months of battery life, according to Aqara.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25659184/8A0A1872.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" title=\"\" />\n<p>I love the idea of using smart locks on other doors in my home. I could see this working on a basement door, a home office, or any other room you like to keep people out of. However, I would like to see a way to permanently enable passage mode. Currently, you have to do it on the device, and it reverts to auto-lock after an undetermined period. This makes it somewhat useless for interior doors. It’s also very large and only comes in black or silver, so it likely wouldn’t blend in with your interior decor. A slimmer option, in more colorways, designed for inside use would be nice to see.</p>\n\n<p>The U300 is expensive at $230, but it&#8217;s similar to other outdoor-rated options (it’s IPX4-rated). The addition of Thread — a protocol that works over a mesh network — makes it easier to extend connectivity further to places like a shed or garage.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-smart-lock-that-s-also-a-video-doorbell\">Best smart lock that’s also a video doorbell</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Eufy FamiLock S3 Max</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/8A0A3476.jpeg?w=300\" width=\"300\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Digital peephole is useful</li><li>Palm unlock is fast</li><li>No subscription fees for video</li><li>Lock supports Matter</li><li>Facial recognition with HomeBase</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Very expensive</li><li>Nighttime video is not great</li><li>No package detection</li><li>HomeBase required for most smart alerts</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DTHMFMKP\"> <strike>$399.99</strike> $349.99 at <strong>Amazon (with coupon)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eufy.com/products/e85v0jy1\"> <strike>$399.99</strike> $349.99 at <strong>Eufy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/p/eufy-S3-Max-Black-Thumb-Turn-Smart-Lock-Deadbolt-with-2K-Video-Doorbell-and-Palm-Scan-Compatible-with-Smart-Devices-E85V0JY1/334469125\"> $399.99 at <strong>The Home Depot</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Connectivity:</em></strong><em> Wi-Fi or Eufy HomeBase / </em><strong><em>Access options:</em></strong><em> Key, palm unlock, keypad, app, voice / </em><strong><em>Auto-unlock:</em></strong><em> No / </em><strong><em>Battery type:</em></strong><em> Removable, rechargeable lithium-ion battery, AAA backup / </em><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong><em> Five months / </em><strong><em>Guest codes:</em></strong><em> Yes / </em><strong><em>Security rating:</em></strong><em> ANSI Grade 1 / </em><strong><em>Works with: </em></strong><em>Matter (including Apple Home), Amazon Alexa, and Google Home</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Eufy’s new FamiLock S3 Max combines a smart lock and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22954554/best-video-doorbell-camera#zVdu3s\">video doorbell</a> in one device and features a digital peephole and a wave-to-unlock function. It also has a keyway and keypad and supports Matter-over-Wi-Fi, so it can work with all the major smart home platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My favorite of all these features is the video screen on the inside part of the lock, which shows a live feed of who is on the other side of the door. If you have a peephole or a window in your door, this might not be much use — and you can opt to get the lock without the screen for $50 less. But as a quick way to confirm who is at your door before opening it, it&#8217;s super handy.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/8A0A3494.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" title=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The lock has another fairly unique feature: <a href=\"https://securityjournalamericas.com/palm-vein-scanning\">palm vein recognition technology</a>. This lets you wave your hand over it to unlock it, and is an alternative form of biometric access to the popular fingerprint reader.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Palm unlocking isn’t any faster or easier than using your fingerprint, though, and I found it harder to get used to. But once I got the hang of it, it worked reliably. Both my kids also picked it up quickly, and my husband, who has trouble with fingerprint locks in general, really liked it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><span>The </span>main reason to buy this lock is for the video doorbell feature. The FamiLock’s 2K camera provides clear, crisp video during daylight hours and decent night vision, although my protruding door frame reflected the LEDs, causing the footage to blow out a bit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 180-degree diagonal field of view meant I could see top to bottom and all of one side (not the other side, though, due to the aforementioned door frame). But packages and people were clearly visible, which is most of what you want to see with a doorbell camera.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/8A0A3480.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" title=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s no fee for viewing recorded footage of visitors in the Eufy app, and videos are stored locally on the device. Live view and recording pulled up promptly in the app, and the doorbell can alert you when it sees a person. For more advanced smart alerts, including facial recognition, you need to connect it to a <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eufy.com%2Fproducts%2Ft80301d1%3Fvariant%3D41846278357178\">Eufy HomeBase</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bear in mind, Matter integration only controls the lock, as cameras aren’t supported by the standard yet, so the benefits of using Matter are fairly limited. (<span>If you’re looking for a biometric Matter lock,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eufy.com%2Fproducts%2Ft85f1111%3Fvariant%3D44170332307642\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eufy’s E30 is a good fingerprint lock that uses Matter-over-Thread</a></span>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Adding a video doorbell to a smart lock puts a lot of strain on the battery. While you can adjust several settings to help save power, Eufy says you’ll only get about five months of battery life from the lock’s giant 15,000mAh removable battery. Handily, four AAA backup batteries are tucked into the top to keep it functioning while you’re recharging the battery (which takes a while). I’ve been testing it for over a week, and the battery indicator hasn’t budged yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At $400, this is a very expensive lock, but it works well and provides dual functionality of a doorbell and door lock.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"read-my-review-of-the-eufy-familock-s3-max\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/\">Read my review of the Eufy FamiLock S3 Max</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-facial-recognition-smart-lock\">Best facial recognition smart lock</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Lockly Visage</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/8A0A3474.jpeg?w=300\" width=\"300\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Facial recognition is super fast</li><li>Home Key <em>and</em> a fingerprint reader</li><li>Compact design</li><li>Comes with two rechargeable batteries</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Keypad is hard to see, fiddly to use</li><li>Wired door sensor is ugly</li><li>No support for Matter</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lockly-Recognition-Fingerprint-Deadbolt-Installation/dp/B0DRXF5NKL\"> $349 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/pep/Lockly-Visage-Facial-Recognition-Zeno-Matte-Black-Deadbolt-Wi-Fi-Smart-Lock-Home-Key-Fingerprint-Keypad-Siri-Alexa-Google-PGK728WRHKMB/329236400?g_store=&#038;source=shoppingads&#038;locale=en-US&#038;pla&#038;utm_source=google&#038;utm_medium=vantage&#038;utm_campaign=62027&#038;utm_content=64557&#038;mtc=SHOPPING-RM-RMP-GGL-D25H-Multi-NA-LOCKLY-NA-PMAX-NA-NA-MK717879001-62027-NBR-23664-NA-VNT-FY25_Q1_Q4_PINGENIEINCLOCKLY_D25H_RM_ES_AON_BAUOpportunity&#038;cm_mmc=SHOPPING-RM-RMP-GGL-D25H-Multi-NA-LOCKLY-NA-PMAX-NA-NA-MK717879001-62027-NBR-23664-NA-VNT-FY25_Q1_Q4_PINGENIEINCLOCKLY_D25H_RM_ES_AON_BAUOpportunity-22475771654--&#038;gad_source=1&#038;gad_campaignid=22469257614&#038;gbraid=0AAAAAolLu9-ymkt2Bchzoh_9RnRqeLRbi&#038;gclid=CjwKCAjw3f_BBhAPEiwAaA3K5CsPEoMdJjWlcO8dY9NSml86Nr7I-WsInXUWIQ6qkMgG3gyfDSpnAxoCpP4QAvD_BwE&#038;gclsrc=aw.ds\"> $349 at <strong>The Home Depot</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://lockly.com/products/lockly-visage-zeno-series\"> $349 at <strong>Lockly</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><em><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wi-Fi (2.4gHz) / <strong>Access options:</strong> Fingerprint, facial recognition, app, voice, keypad, Home Key, key / <strong>Auto-unlock:</strong> No / <strong>Battery type:</strong> 10,000mAh rechargeable</em> <em>/ <strong>Battery life:</strong> Eight months / <strong>Guest codes:</strong> Yes / <strong><em>Security rating:</em></strong><em> ANSI Grade 1</em></em></em> / <em><em><strong>Works with: </strong>Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home</em></em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I was very impressed with the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24025150/lockly-visage-facial-recognition-smart-lock-matter-home-key\">Lockly Visage</a>. The first facial recognition residential smart lock on the market, it also features a fingerprint reader, a keypad, a keyway, and Apple Home Key — that&#8217;s a lot of high-tech ways to unlock your door. And while it&#8217;s probably too much lock for most people, if you are a super smart home user or a major gadget nerd, you’ll love this lock.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/8A0A3510.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" title=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I was skeptical about the facial unlocking at first, but it worked really well, opening a second or two before I put my hand on the handle. The only caveat is that I had to be approaching face-on, which in most cases I was, but the couple of times I approached from a slightly odd angle, it failed to unlock. In those cases, though, I had the option of using my fingerprint or Home Key.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s also a touchscreen keypad, which is mainly useful for handing out codes to guests and visitors whose faces and fingers you don’t want to scan into your lock. The keypad is probably my least favorite part of the lock; it&#8217;s very small, which is good for the overall look, but fiddly to access. It&#8217;s also hard to see in bright light. But with all the other ways to unlock, this isn’t a deal-breaker.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Note that the Visage doesn’t take video or still images; its infrared camera is only used for facial recognition, data for which is stored on the device. Lockly does have <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flockly.com%2Fproducts%2Flockly-vision-zeno-series\">a video doorbell version for $429</a>, though that doesn’t have facial recognition.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/8A0A3457.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" title=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Surprisingly, despite all the tech packed into it, the lock is compact and stylish-looking and works with the redesigned Lockly Home app, which is now more straightforward and easier to use. The lock works over Wi-Fi and supports Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa, but there’s no support for Matter.</p>\n\n<p>Lockly claims eight months of battery life with its included rechargeable 10,000mAh battery. Uniquely, it comes with two batteries, so you can swap one and keep the lock online while charging the other. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At $350, the Lockly Visage is very expensive, but considering the tech packed into this lock, plus the two batteries, it’s not outrageous.

It has a fingerprint reader, key, and keypad, and you can use the fingerprint access through the Eufy app while connecting it to platforms like Apple Home through Matter. Unlike the Kwikset Halo Select, you can use Wi-Fi and Thread simultaneously, which is unusual. I’ve not tested it long enough to determine if you still benefit from Thread’s better battery life. It’s cheaper than the Halo, has a fingerprint reader instead of auto-unlock, and promises 8 months of battery life. It can also integrate with a Eufy doorbell to control it from a live view. It has a nice compact design, but the rear housing is huge to fit 8 AA batteries. The lock is loud in operation, and the fingerprint reader was finicky; it also has the lowest ANSI/BHMA rating.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://u-tec.com/products/ultraloq-bolt-fingerprint-matter\">U-tec’s $199.99 Bolt Fingerprint Matter</a> works over Thread and can be set up directly in your smart home platform of choice — no need to use U-tec’s U Home. But if you want to use its built-in fingerprint reader, you’ll need to download the app. And if you don’t use it, then it&#8217;s kind of a waste of space, so the whole “you only need one app” feature falls flat. I also don’t love the design of the Ultraloqs, while smaller on the exterior than most smart locks, they are squat and chunky looking, resembling a combination lock rather than door hardware.

It’s simple, with a clean design and a touchscreen keypad for entry.
