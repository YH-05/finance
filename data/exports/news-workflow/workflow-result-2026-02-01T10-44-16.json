          "body_text": "← all postsSwift is a more convenient Rust\n(originally published on my old blog)\nI’ve been learning Rust lately.\nRust is one of the most loved languages out there, is fast, and has an amazing community. Rust invented the concept of ownership as a solution memory management issues without resorting to something slower like Garbage Collection or Reference Counting. But, when you don’t need to be quite as low level, it gives you utilities such as Rc, Arc and Cow to do reference counting and “clone-on-right” in your code. And, when you need to go lower-level still, you can use the unsafe system and access raw C pointers.\nRust also has a bunch of awesome features from functional languages like tagged enums, match expressions, first class functions and a powerful type system with generics.\nRust has an LLVM-based compiler which lets it compile to native code and WASM.\nI’ve also been doing a bit of Swift programming for a couple of years now. And the more I learn Rust, the more I see a reflection of Swift. (I know that Swift stole a lot of ideas from Rust, I’m talking about my own perspective here).\nSwift, too, has awesome features from functional languages like tagged enums, match expressions and first-class functions. It too has a very powerful type system with generics.\nSwift too gives you complete type-safety without a garbage collector. By default, everything is a value type with “copy-on-write” semantics. But when you need extra speed you can opt into an ownership system and “move” values to avoid copying. And if you need to go even lower level, you can use the unsafe system and access raw C pointers.\nSwift has an LLVM-based compiler which lets it compile to native code and WASM.\n#Deja Vu?\nYou’re probably feeling like you just read the same paragraphs twice. This is no accident. Swift is extremely similar to Rust and has most of the same feature-set. But there is a very big difference is perspective. If you consider the default memory model, this will start to make a lot of sense.\n#Rust is bottom-up, Swift is top-down.\nRust is a low-level systems language at heart, but it gives you the tools to go higher level. Swift starts at a high level and gives you the ability to go low-level.\nThe most obvious example of this is the memory management model. Swift use value-types by default with copy-on-write semantics. This is the equivalent of using Cow<> for all your values in Rust. But defaults matter. Rust makes it easy to use “moved” and “borrowed” values but requires extra ceremony to use Cow<> values as you need to “unwrap” them .as_mutable() to actually use the value within. Swift makes these Copy-on-Write values easy to use and instead requires extra ceremony to use borrowing and moving instead. Rust is faster by default, Swift is simpler and easier by default.\n#Swift takes Rust’s ideas and hides them in C-like syntax.\nSwift’s syntax is a masterclass in taking awesome functional language concepts and hiding them in C-like syntax to trick the developers into accepting them.\nConsider match statements. This is what a match statement looks like in Rust:\nenum Coin {    Penny,    Nickel,    Dime,    Quarter,}fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {    match coin {        Coin::Penny => 1,        Coin::Nickel => 5,        Coin::Dime => 10,        Coin::Quarter => 25,    }}\nHere’s how that same code would be written in Swift:\nenum Coin {    case penny    case nickel    case dime    case quarter}func valueInCents(coin: Coin) -> Int {    switch coin {    case .penny: 1    case .nickel: 5    case .dime: 10    case .quarter: 25    }}\nSwift doesn’t have a match statement or expression. It has a switch statement that developers are already familiar with. Except this switch statement is actually not a switch statement at all. It’s an expression. It doesn’t “fallthrough”. It does pattern matching. It’s just a match expression with a different name and syntax.\nIn fact, Swift treats enums as more than just types and lets you put methods directly on it:\nenum Coin {    case penny    case nickel    case dime    case quarter    func valueInCents() -> Int {        switch self {        case .penny: 1        case .nickel: 5        case .dime: 10        case .quarter: 25        }    }}\n#Optional Types\nRust doesn’t have null, but it does have None. Swift has a nil, but it’s really just a None in hiding. Instead of an Option<T>, Swift let’s you use T?, but the compiler still forces you to check that the value is not nil before you can use it.\nYou get the same safety with more convenience since you can do this in Swift with an optional type:\nlet val: T?if let val {  // val is now of type `T`.}\nAlso, you’re not forced to wrap every value with a Some(val) before returning it. The Swift compiler takes care of that for you. A T will transparently be converted into a T? when needed.\n#Error Handling\nRust doesn’t have try-catch. Instead it has a Result type which contains the success and error types.\nSwift doesn’t have a try-catch either, but it does have do-catch and you have to use try before calling a function that could throw. Again, this is just deception for those developers coming from C-like languages. Swift’s error handling works exactly like Rust’s behind the scenes, but it is hidden in a clever, familiar syntax.\nfunc usesErrorThrowingFunction() throws {  let x = try thisFnCanThrow()}func handlesErrors() {  do {    let x = try thisFnCanThrow()  } catch err {    // handle the `err` here.  }}\nThis is very similar to how Rust let’s you use ? at the end of statements to automatically forward errors, but you don’t have to wrap your success values in Ok().\n#Rust’s compiler catches problems. Swift’s compiler solves some of them\nThere are many common problems that Rust’s compiler will catch at compile time and even suggest solutions for you. The example that portrays this well is self-referencing enums.\nConsider an enum that represents a tree. Since, it is a recursive type, Rust will force you to use something like Box<> for referencing a type within itself.\nenum TreeNode<T> {    Leaf(T),    Branch(Vec<Box<TreeNode<T>>>),}\n(You could also us Box<Vec<TreeNode<T>>> instead)\nThis makes the problem explicit and forces you to deal with it directly. Swift is a little more, automatic.\nindirect enum TreeNode<T> {    case leaf(T)    case branch([TreeNode<T>])}\nNote: that you still have to annotate this enum with the indirect keyword to indicate that it is recursive. But once you’ve done that, Swift’s compiler takes care of the rest. You don’t have to think about Box<> or Rc<>. The values just work normally.\n#Swift is less “pure”\nSwift was designed to replace Objective-C and needed to be able to interface with existing code. So, it has made a lot of pragmatic choices that makes it a much less “pure” and “minimalist” language. Swift is a pretty big language compared to Rust and has many more features built-in. However, Swift is designed with “progressive disclosure” in mind which means that just as soon as you think you’ve learned the language a little more of the iceberg pops out of the water.\nHere are just some of the language features:\nClasses / Inhertence\nasync-await\nasync-sequences\nactors\ngetters and setters\nlazy properties\nproperty wrappers\nResult Builders (for building tree-like structures. e.g. HTML / SwiftUI)\n#Convenience has its costs\nSwift is a far easier language to get started and productive with. The syntax is more familiar and a lot more is done for you automatically. But this really just makes Swift a higher-level language and it comes with the same tradeoffs.\nBy default, a Rust program is much faster than a Swift program. This is because Rust is fast by default, and lets you be slow, while Swift is easy by default and lets you be fast.\nBased on this, I would say both languages have their uses. Rust is better for systems and embedded programming. It’s better for writing compilers and browser engines (Servo) and it’s better for writing entire operating systems.\nSwift is better for writing UI and servers and some parts of compilers and operating systems. Over time I expect to see the overlap get bigger.\n#The “cross-platform” problem\nThere is a perception that Swift is only a good language for Apple platforms. While this was once true, this is no longer the case and Swift is becoming increasingly a good cross-platform language. Hell, Swift even compiles to wasm, and the forks made by the swift-wasm team were merged back into Swift core earlier this year.\nSwift on Windows is being used by The Browser Company to share code and bring the Arc browser to windows. Swift on Linux has long been supported by Apple themselves in order to push “Swift on Server”. Apple is directly sponsoring the Swift on Server conference.\nThis year Embedded Swift was also announced which is already being used on small devices like the Panic Playdate.\nSwift website has been highlighting many of these projects:\nSwift on Windows\nEmbedded Swift\nGnome apps with Swift on Linux\nSwift on Playdate\nThe browser company says that Interoperability is Swift’s super power.\nAnd the Swift project has been trying make working with Swift a great experience outside of XCode with projects like an open source LSP and funding the the VSCode extension.\n#Swift is not a perfect language.\nCompile times are (like Rust) quite bad. There is some amount of feature creep and the language is larger than it should be. Not all syntax feels familiar. The package ecosystem isn’t nearly as rich as Rust.\nBut the “Swift is only for Apple platforms” is an old and tired cliche at this point. Swift is already a cross-platform, ABI-stable language with no GC, automatic Reference Counting and the option to opt into ownership for even more performance. Swift packages increasingly work on Linux. Foundation was ported to Swift, open sourced and made open source. It’s still early days for Swift as a good, more convenient, Rust alternative for cross-platform development, but it is here now. It’s no longer a future to wait for.",

It scales from embedded systems with as\nlittle as 4 MB of memory to highly dynamic general-purpose workloads.\nGenode is based on a recursive system structure. Each program runs in a\ndedicated sandbox and gets granted only those access rights and resources that\nare needed for its specific purpose. Programs can create and manage\nsub-sandboxes out of their own resources, thereby forming hierarchies where\npolicies can be applied at each level. The framework provides mechanisms to\nlet programs communicate with each other and trade their resources, but only\nin strictly-defined manners. Thanks to this rigid regime, the attack surface\nof security-critical functions can be reduced by orders of magnitude compared\nto contemporary operating systems.\nThe framework aligns the construction principles of L4 with Unix philosophy.\nIn line with Unix philosophy, Genode is a collection of small building blocks,\nout of which sophisticated systems can be composed. But unlike Unix, those\nbuilding blocks include not only applications but also all classical OS\nfunctionalities including kernels, device drivers, file systems, and protocol\nstacks.\nFeatures\nCPU architectures: x86 (32 and 64 bit), ARM (32 and 64 bit), RISC-V\nKernels: most members of the L4 family\n(NOVA,\nseL4,\nFiasco.OC,\nOKL4 v2.1,\nL4ka::Pistachio,\nL4/Fiasco),\nLinux, and a custom kernel.\nVirtualization: VirtualBox (on NOVA), a custom virtual machine monitor\nfor ARM, and a custom runtime for Unix software\nOver 100 ready-to-use\ncomponents\nGenode is open source and commercially supported by\nGenode Labs.\nRoad map\nThe direction where the project is currently heading\nChallenges\nA collection of project ideas, giving a glimpse on possible future directions\nPublications\nPublications related to Genode\nLicensing\nOpen-Source and commercial licensing\nScreenshots\nScreenshots of Genode-based system scenarios",

          "body_text": "Mobile carriers can get your GPS location\n2026-01-31\nIn iOS 26.3, Apple introduced a new privacy feature which limits “precise location” data made available to cellular networks via cell towers. The feature is only available to devices with Apple’s in-house modem introduced in 2025. The announcement1 says\nCellular networks can determine your location based on which cell towers your device connects to.\nThis is well-known. I have served on a jury where the prosecution obtained location data from cell towers. Since cell towers are sparse (especially before 5G), the accuracy is in the range of tens to hundreds of metres2.\nBut this is not the whole truth, because cellular standards have built-in protocols that make your device silently send GNSS (i.e. GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou) location to the carrier. This would have the same precision as what you see in your Map apps, in single-digit metres.\nIn 2G and 3G this is called Radio Resources LCS Protocol (RRLP)\nSo the network simply asks “tell me your GPS coordinates if you know them” and the phone will respond3.\nIn 4G and 5G this is called LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP)\nRRLP, RRC, and LPP are natively control-plane positioning protocols. This means that they are transported in the inner workings of cellular networks and are practically invisible to end users4.\nIt’s worth noting that GNSS location is never meant to leave your device. GNSS coordinates are calculated entirely passively, your device doesn’t need to send a single bit of information. Using GNSS is like finding out where you are by reading a road sign: you don’t have to tell anyone else you read a road sign, anyone can read a road sign, and the people who put up road signs don’t know who read which road sign when.\nThese capabilities are not secrets but somehow they have mostly slid under the radar of the public consciousness. They have been used in the wild for a long time, such as by the DEA in the US in 200656:\n[T]he DEA agents procured a court order (but not a search warrant) to obtain GPS coordinates from the courier’s phone via a ping, or signal requesting those coordinates, sent by the phone company to the phone.\nAnd by Shin Bet in Israel, which tracks everyone everywhere all the time7:\nThe GSS Tool was based on centralized cellular tracking operated by Israel’s General Security Services (GSS). The technology was based on a framework that tracks all the cellular phones running in Israel through the cellular companies’ data centers. According to news sources, it routinely collects information from cellular companies and identifies the location of all phones through cellular antenna triangulation and GPS data7.\nNotably, the Israeli government started using the data for contact tracing in March 202078, only a few weeks after the first Israeli COVID-19 case. An individual would be sent an SMS message informing them of close contact with a COVID patient and required to quarantine. This is good evidence that the location data Israeli carriers are collecting are far more precise than what cell towers alone can achieve.\nA major caveat is that I don’t know if RRLP and LPP are the exact techniques, and the only techniques, used by DEA, Shin Bet, and possibly others to collect GNSS data; there could be other protocols or backdoors we’re not privy to.\nAnother unknown is whether these protocols can be exploited remotely by a foreign carrier. Saudi Arabia has abused SS7 to spy on people in the US9, but as far as I know this only locates a device to the coverage area of a Mobile Switching Center, which is less precise than cell tower data. Nonetheless, given the abysmal culture, competency, and integrity in the telecom industry, I would not be shocked if it’s possible for a state actor to obtain the precise GNSS coordinates of anyone on earth using a phone number/IMEI.\nApple made a good step in iOS 26.3 to limit at least one vector of mass surveillance, enabled by having full control of the modem silicon and firmware. They must now allow users to disable GNSS location responses to mobile carriers, and notify the user when such attempts are made to their device.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/126101 ↩\nhttps://transition.fcc.gov/pshs/911/Apps Wrkshp 2015/911_Help_SMS_WhitePaper0515.pdf ↩\nhttps://laforge.gnumonks.org/blog/20101217-learning_about_gps/ ↩\nComment on United States v.

          "body_text": "Finland looks to end \"uncontrolled human experiment\" with Australia-style ban on social mediaPrime Minister Petteri Orpo (NCP), the Finnish public health authority THL and two-thirds of Finns are in favour of banning or restricting the use of social media by under-15s.Children under the age of 15 might be deleting their apps if the government's plans are passed into law.Ronan Browne31.1. 09:01Lunch break at the Finnish International School of Tampere (FISTA) is a boisterous time.The yard is filled with children — ranging from grades 1 to 9, or ages 6 to 16 — running around, shouting, playing football, shooting basketball hoops, doing what kids do.And there's not a single screen in sight.FISTA has taken advantage of the law change, brought in last August, which allows schools to restrict or completely ban the use of mobile phones during school hours. At FISTA, this means no phones at all unless specifically used for learning in the classroom.\"We've seen that cutting down on the possibilities for students to use their phones, during the breaks for instance, has spurred a lot of creativity,\" FISTA vice principal Antti Koivisto notes.\"They're more active, doing more physical things like playing games outdoors or taking part in the organised break activities or just socialising with each other.\"With the smartphone restriction in schools widely considered to have been a success, Finland's government has now set its sights on social media platforms.Prime Minister Petteri Orpo (NCP) said earlier this month that he supports banning the use of social media by children under the age of 15.\"I am deeply concerned about the lack of physical activity among children and young people, and the fact that it is increasing,\" Orpo said at the time.And there is a growing groundswell of support for Finland introducing such a ban. Two-thirds of respondents to a survey published earlier this week said they back a ban on social media for under-15s. This is a near 10 percentage point jump compared to a similar survey carried out just last summer.\"Uncontrolled human experiment\"The concerns over social media, and in particular the effects on children, have been well-documented — but Finnish researcher Silja Kosola's recent description of the phenomenon as an \"uncontrolled human experiment\" has grabbed people's attention once again.Kosola, an associate professor in adolescent medicine, has researched the impact of social media on young people, and tells Yle News that the consequences are not very well understood.\"We see a rise in self-harm and especially eating disorders. We see a big separation in the values of young girls and boys, which is also a big problem in society,\" Kosola explains.In the video below, Silja Kosola explains the detrimental effects that excessive use of social media can have on young people.Silja Kosola speaking on the All Points North podcast.She further notes that certain aspects of Finnish culture — such as the independence and freedom granted to children from a young age — have unwittingly exacerbated the ill effects of social media use.\"We have given smartphones to younger people more than anywhere else in the world. Just a couple of years ago, about 95 percent of first graders had their own smartphone, and that hasn't happened anywhere else,\" she says.All eyes on AustraliaSince 10 December last year, children under the age of 16 in Australia have been banned from using social media platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese began drafting the legislation after he received a heartfelt letter from a grieving mother who lost her 12-year-old daughter to suicide.Although Albanese has never revealed the details of the letter, he told public broadcaster ABC that it was \"obvious social media had played a key role\" in the young girl's death.The legislation aims to shift the burden away from parents and children and onto the social media companies, who face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (29 million euros) if they consistently fail to keep kids off their platforms.Clare Armstrong, ABC's chief digital political correspondent, told Yle News that the initial reaction to the roll-out has been some confusion but no little \"relief\".\"The government often talks about this law as being a tool to help parents and other institutions enforce and start conversations about tech and social media in ways that before, they couldn't,\" she says.Although it is still early days, as the ban has only been in force for about six weeks, Armstrong adds that the early indicators have been good.ABC journalist Clare Armstrong explains in the video below how children in Australia have been spending their time since the social media ban was introduced.Clare Armstrong speaking on the All Points North podcast.However, she adds a note of caution to any countries — such as Finland — looking to emulate the Australian model, noting that communication is key.\"Because you can write a very good law, but if the public doesn't understand it, and if it can't be enforced at that household level easily, then it's bound to fail,\" Armstrong says.Playing to Finland's strengthsSeona Candy, an Australian living in Helsinki for over eight years, has been keenly following the events in her homeland since the social media ban came into effect in December.She has heard anecdotally that if kids find themselves blocked from one platform, they just set up an account on another, \"ones that maybe their parents don't even know exist\".\"And this is then much, much harder, because those platforms don't have parental controls, so they don't have those things already designed into them that the more mainstream platforms do,\" Candy says.Because of this issue, and others she has heard about, she warns against Finland introducing like-for-like legislation based around Australia's \"reactive, knee-jerk\" law change.\"I think the Finnish government should really invest in digital education, and digital literacy, and teach kids about digital safety. Finland is world-famous for education, and for media literacy. Play to your strengths, right?\"The All Points North podcast asked if Finland should introduce a similar ban on social media as in Australia.

Sources: bilalulker / Getty; FilmPublicityArchive / United Archives / Getty; Julian Stratenschulte / Picture Alliance / Getty; Prasert Krainukul / Getty.January 30, 2026, 8:41 AM ET ShareSave Listen−1.0x+0:009:41Everyone knows it’s hard to get college students to do the reading—remember books? But the attention-span crisis is not limited to the written word. Professors are now finding that they can’t even get film students—film students—to sit through movies. “I used to think, If homework is watching a movie, that is the best homework ever,” Craig Erpelding, a film professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, told me. “But students will not do it.”I heard similar observations from 20 film-studies professors around the country. They told me that over the past decade, and particularly since the pandemic, students have struggled to pay attention to feature-length films. Malcolm Turvey, the founding director of Tufts University’s Film and Media Studies Program, officially bans electronics during film screenings. Enforcing the ban is another matter: About half the class ends up looking furtively at their phones.A handful of professors told me they hadn’t noticed any change. Some students have always found old movies to be slow, Lynn Spigel, a professor of screen cultures at Northwestern University, told me. “But the ones who are really dedicated to learning film always were into it, and they still are.”Most of the instructors I spoke with, however, feel that something is different now. And the problem is not limited to large introductory courses. Akira Mizuta Lippit, a cinema and media-studies professor at the University of Southern California—home to perhaps the top film program in the country—said that his students remind him of nicotine addicts going through withdrawal during screenings: The longer they go without checking their phone, the more they fidget. Eventually, they give in. He recently screened the 1974 Francis Ford Coppola classic The Conversation. At the outset, he told students that even if they ignored parts of the film, they needed to watch the famously essential and prophetic final scene. Even that request proved too much for some of the class. When the scene played, Lippit noticed that several students were staring at their phones, he told me. “You do have to just pay attention at the very end, and I just can’t get everybody to do that,” he said.From the November 2024 issue: The elite college students who can’t read booksMany students are resisting the idea of in-person screenings altogether. Given the ease of streaming assignments from their dorm rooms, they see gathering in a campus theater as an imposition. Professors whose syllabi require in-person screenings outside of class time might see their enrollment drop, Meredith Ward, director of the Program in Film and Media Studies at Johns Hopkins University, told me. Accordingly, many professors now allow students to stream movies on their own time.You can imagine how that turns out. At Indiana University, where Erpelding worked until 2024, professors could track whether students watched films on the campus’s internal streaming platform. Fewer than 50 percent would even start the movies, he said, and only about 20 percent made it to the end. (Recall that these are students who chose to take a film class.) Even when students stream the entire film, it’s not clear how closely they watch it. Some are surely folding laundry or scrolling Instagram, or both, while the movie plays.The students I spoke with admitted to their own inattentiveness. They even felt bad about it. But that wasn’t enough to make them sit through the assigned movies. Mridula Natarajan, a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, took a world-cinema class this past fall. “There were some movies that were extremely slow-paced, and ironically, that was the point of the movie,” she told me. “But I guess impatience made me skip through stuff or watch it on two-times speed.”After watching movies distractedly—if they watch them at all—students unsurprisingly can’t answer basic questions about what they saw. In a multiple-choice question on a recent final exam, Jeff Smith, a film professor at UW Madison, asked what happens at the end of the Truffaut film Jules and Jim. More than half of the class picked one of the wrong options, saying that characters hide from the Nazis (the film takes place during World War I) or get drunk with Ernest Hemingway (who does not appear in the movie). Smith has administered similar exams for almost two decades; he had to grade his most recent exam on a curve to keep students’ marks within a normal range.The professors I spoke with didn’t blame students for their shortcomings; they focused instead on how media diets have changed. From 1997 to 2014, screen time for children under age 2 doubled. And the screen in question, once a television, is now more likely to be a tablet or a smartphone. Students arriving in college today have no memory of a world before the infinite scroll. As teenagers, they spent nearly five hours a day on social media, with much of that time used for flicking from one short-form video to the next. An analysis of people’s attention while working on a computer found that they now switch between tabs or apps every 47 seconds, down from once every two and a half minutes in 2004. “I can imagine that if your body and your psychology are not trained for the duration of a feature-length film, it will just feel excruciatingly long,” USC’s Lippit said. (He also hypothesized that, because every movie is available on demand, students feel that they can always rewatch should they miss something—even if they rarely take advantage of that option.)Listen: The smartphone kids are not all rightKyle Stine, a film and media-studies professor at Johns Hopkins, usually begins his course with an icebreaker: What’s a movie you watched recently? In the past few years, some students have struggled to name any film. Kristen Warner, a performing- and media-arts professor at Cornell University, has noticed a similar trend. Some of her students arrive having seen only Disney movies. Erpelding, at UW Madison, said he tries to find a movie that everyone in his class has seen, to serve as a shared reference point they can talk about. Lately, that’s become impossible. Even students who are interested in going into filmmaking don’t necessarily love watching films. “The disconnect is that 10 years ago, people who wanted to go study film and media creation were cinephiles themselves,” Erpelding told me. “Nowadays, they’re people that consume the same thing everyone else consumes, which is social media.”Of course, young people haven’t given up on movies altogether. But the feature films that they do watch now tend to be engineered to cater to their attentional deficit. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Matt Damon, the star of many movies that college students may not have seen, said that Netflix has started encouraging filmmakers to put action sequences in the first five minutes of a film to get viewers hooked. And just because young people are streaming movies, it doesn’t mean they’re paying attention. When they sit down to watch, many are browsing social media on a second screen. Netflix has accordingly advised directors to have characters repeat the plot three or four times so that multitasking audiences can keep up with what’s happening, Damon said.Some professors are treating wilting attention spans as a problem to be solved, not a reality to accept. Stine, at Johns Hopkins, is piloting a course on “slow cinema”—minimalist films with almost no narrative thrust—with the goal of helping students redevelop long modes of attention. Rick Warner, the director of film studies at the University of North Carolina, deliberately selects films with slow pacing and subtle details, such as Chantal Akerman’s Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles, a three-hour movie that mostly follows a woman doing chores in her apartment. “I try to teach films that put their habits of viewing under strain,” Warner told me. “I’m trying to sell them on the idea that a film watched properly can actually help them retrain their perception and can teach them how to concentrate again.” Once they get used to it, students enjoy the challenge, he said.But other professors, perhaps concluding that resistance is futile, are adjusting to the media their students grew up on. Some show shorter films or have students watch movies over multiple sittings. Erpelding, who primarily teaches filmmaking courses, has moved from teaching traditional production methods to explaining how to maximize audience engagement. He now asks students to make three- or four-minute films, similar to the social-media edits they see online. After all, that seems to be the only type of video many young people want to watch.By the way, the last scene of The Conversation has the paranoid Gene Hackman destroying his apartment in a desperate and futile search for listening devices. He eventually gives up, and mournfully plays the saxophone amid the wreckage. It’s a brilliant scene, and worth the wait.About the AuthorRose HorowitchFollowRose Horowitch is a staff writer at The Atlantic.Explore More Topicsmovies, social media, Netflix",

Photograph: Yui Mok/PAWhatsAppUS authorities reportedly investigate claims that Meta can read encrypted WhatsApp messagesA lawsuit filed last week alleges tech firm ‘can access virtually all’ private communications, a claim the company has deniedAisha DownSat 31 Jan 2026 13.01 GMTLast modified on Sat 31 Jan 2026 13.02 GMTShareUS authorities have reportedly investigated claims that Meta can read users’ encrypted chats on the WhatsApp messaging platform, which it owns.The reports follow a lawsuit filed last week, which claimed Meta “can access virtually all of WhatsApp users’ purportedly ‘private’ communications”.Meta has denied the allegation, reported by Bloomberg, calling the lawsuit’s claim “categorically false and absurd”. It suggested the claim was a tactic to support the NSO Group, an Israeli firm that develops spyware used against activists and journalists, and which recently lost a lawsuit brought by WhatsApp.The firm that filed last week’s lawsuit against Meta, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, attributes the allegation to unnamed “courageous” whistleblowers from Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa.Quinn Emanuel is, in a separate case, helping to represent the NSO Group in its appeal against a judgment from a US federal court last year, which ordered it to pay $167m to WhatsApp for violating its terms of service in its deployment of Pegasus spyware against more than 1,400 users.“We’re pursuing sanctions against Quinn Emanuel for filing a meritless lawsuit that was designed purely to grab headlines,” said Carl Woog, a Meta spokesperson, in a statement. “This is the same firm that is trying to help NSO overturn an injunction that barred their operations for targeting journalists and government officials with spyware.”Adam Wolfson, a partner at Quinn Emanuel said: “Our colleagues’ defence of NSO on appeal has nothing to do with the facts disclosed to us and which form the basis of the lawsuit we brought for worldwide WhatsApp users.“We look forward to moving forward with those claims and note WhatsApp’s denials have all been carefully worded in a way that stops short of denying the central allegation in the complaint – that Meta has the ability to read WhatsApp messages, regardless of its claims about end-to-end encryption.”Steven Murdoch, professor of security engineering at UCL, said the lawsuit was “a bit strange”. “It seems to be going mostly on whistleblowers, and we don’t know much about them or their credibility,” he said. “I would be very surprised if what they are claiming is actually true.”If WhatsApp were, indeed, reading users’ messages, this was likely to have been discovered by staff and would end the business, he said. “It’s very hard to keep secrets inside a company. If there was something as scandalous as this going on, I think it’s very likely that it would have leaked out from someone within WhatsApp.”The Bloomberg article cites reports and interviews from officials within the US Department of Commerce in claiming that the US has investigated whether Meta could read WhatsApp messages. However, a spokesperson for the department called these assertions “unsubstantiated”.WhatsApp bills itself as an end-to-end encrypted platform, which means that messages can be read only by their sender and recipient, and are not decoded by a server in the middle.This contrasts with some other messaging apps, such as Telegram, which encrypt messages between a sender and its own servers, preventing third parties from reading the messages, but allowing them – in theory – to be decoded and read by Telegram itself.A senior executive in the technology sector told the Guardian that WhatsApp’s vaunted privacy “leaves much to be desired”, given the platform’s willingness to collect metadata on its users, such as their profile information, their contact lists, and who they speak to and when.However, the “idea that WhatsApp can selectively and retroactively access the content of [end-to-end encrypted] individual chats is a mathematical impossibility”, he said.Woog, of Meta, said: “We’re pursuing sanctions against Quinn Emanuel for filing a meritless lawsuit that was designed purely to grab headlines. WhatsApp’s encryption remains secure and we’ll continue to stand up against those trying to deny people’s right to private communication.”Explore more on these topicsWhatsAppMetaPrivacynewsShareReuse this content",

I Can't Find my Way-land\n4. Sympathy for the Devil\n5. Goals\n6. Results\n6.1. The Good\n6.2. The Ambiguous\n6.3. The Bad\n7. Overall\n8. Notes\n1. My Journey to Guix System\nFeel free to skip this section if you don't really care about backstories. I just figured it makes sense to recap how and why one might start having an interest in declarative distros before tackling the main topic.\nI've been a Linux-only1 user for about ten years now and, like many others, I too embarked on the arduous journey of distro-hopping. I started with Mint and when that felt too slow, I switched to Ubuntu. When Ubuntu felt too handholdy2, I switched to Arch, which proved to be my main driver for well over five or so years. And when I couldn't resist the Siren's call, I moved on to Gentoo, thinking surely \"harder is better\". Which resulted in severe burnout in a few months, so I capitulated and switched to Fedora, which was very stable and honestly an all around excellent system. But once more, my interest was piqued, and (before today's adventure) I finally switched to NixOS.\nI've always had a passing interest towards Nix ever since I've first heard about it, but until fairly recently, I always dismissed it as a tool for DevOps guys. The syntax was weird, the need for reproducible environments seemingly irrelevant, and stuff like the oft-recommended Nix Pills seemed anything but newbie-friendly.\nSo then why would someone like me, who's so adamant about not needing Nix eventually choose to go all-in? I guess it was at first less about Nix being better and just the rest being worse.\nOf the two big reasons for the switch, one was that I realized that having per-directory environments for your projects is actually a very handy thing to do when you like to toy around with many technologies. I used to generate my other blog using Jekyll and, no matter which distro I used, it was always a pain in the neck to have a good Ruby environment set up. bundler install didn't really want to work without privileges and I wasn't really a fan of unleashing sudo on it, but usually that was the only way I could get things to work.\nWith Nix, however, it was a matter of just describing a few packages in a shell and boom, Ruby in one folder, no Ruby (and thus no mess) everywhere else. I was hooked! I started adding shell.nix files to all my little projects, hell, I started planning projects by first adding a shell.nix with all the dependencies I would reasonably need.\nThe other reason, which ultimately cemented that I need to commit, was that I was getting tired of my installed packages slowly drifting out of control. Sure, every package manager has some method of listing what's installed, but these are usually cumbersome and completely ephemeral (in the sense that any listing becomes invalid the moment you change anything).\nWith NixOS, the equation is flipped on its head: No longer did I query the system to tell me what's installed and what's not, it was now the system that worked based on files that I edit. The difference sounds small on paper, but for me it was an extremely liberating feeling to know that I could edit my system configuration in a versionable, explicit, and centralized way.\nBut NixOS isn't the only declarative distro out there. In fact GNU forked Nix fairly early and made their own spin called Guix, whose big innovation is that, instead of using the unwieldy Nix-language, it uses Scheme. Specifically Guile Scheme, GNU's sanctioned configuration language. I've been following Guix for a bit, but it never felt quite ready to me with stuff like KDE being only barely supported and a lot of hardware not working out of the box.\nHowever, now that (after three years) Guix announced its 1.5.0 release with a lot of stuff stabilized and KDE finally a first-party citizen, I figured now is the best time to give it a fresh shot. This post captures my experiences from installation to the first 3-4 days.\n2. Installer Impressions\nPlug your USB in, dd the file onto the drive, reboot, nothing unusual. If you've ever installed a Linux system, it's more of the same.\nAfter selecting the pendrive in my BIOS settings, the monitor began to glow in a deep, radiant blue as the Guix System logo appeared on my screen… only to suddenly switch to a menacing red: My CPU's integrated GPU is not supported by free firmware. A helpful popup gave me a gentle nudge about picking free hardware next time (buddy, have you seen the PC part prices these days?) and off I went into the installer proper.\nFigure 1: Picture of the installer graciously borrowed from the Guix installer manual.\nThe installer itself is refreshingly barebones and I mean this in a positive way. It asks all the necessary questions and provides a nice basic configuration file, all done in a retro Ncurses-based TUI. I was really happy to see that, unlike my last attempt at using Guix System in the early 2020-s, KDE Plasma is now a first-party choice during installation. I never really vibed too much with GNOME and the other options didn't appeal either, so the choice was obvious.\nNow, I'm not sure if I just picked the worst possible time or if the Guix servers were facing unusual load or whatever may have happened, but after such a breeze of a setup, the moment I pressed install, my PC became unusable for the next 2.5 hours. Which is unacceptable for an installation process these days in my opinion. I am lucky enough to live in a household with fiber-optic internet, that merely shrugs at bandwidth of up to a gigabyte per second and yet nearly all packages downloaded with a whopping 50 kilobytes per second, meaning even small-ish 5-10 megabyte packages took long minutes to download.3\nA reboot later my issues only got worse.\n3. I Can't Find my Way-land\nI was assuming I'd get SDDM after having chosen KDE Plasma, but (what a later, closer read of the manual made me realize is the expected outcome for a default config) it was GDM that loaded in. I entered my name and password, and I was greeted with the familiar Plasma 6 spinner. The first hint that something might be off was that it loaded a bit longer than usual, but I was not going to get mad at waiting 10 seconds instead of 3. After all, I did just wait magnitudes longer to get here.\nWith practically nothing installed beyond the very basics, I clicked on Konsole, hoping to start prodding around my config and add some of my day to day apps. To my horror, it opened in the top left corner, without a titlebar and without any borders. What's more, no matter what I did, I couldn't move it. It also didn't show up on the menu bar, despite the application launcher still being completely usable. At this point I was fairly exhausted by these antics, but I figured,\nWell, it's a brand new release, perhaps this just snuck in. Let's give updating a shot and see if that helps.\nSo I issued guix pull… The download whizzed by with speed quite unexpected after what I experienced with the installer… Only to crash into the brick wall that's indexing. Okay, whatever, another 10-12 minutes down the drain, at least now I have newest version.\nFigure 2: Better than before download speeds\nExcept I didn't. Because, unlike Nix, the guix executable is not an omnipresent, unique thing that anyone and everyone uses on your PC. Not only does every user have their own instance, if you don't issue a certain set of commands, you won't start using the new version, despite updating it.\nTo Guix's credit, the CLI does scream at you to update your environment or else you'll keep using the old version, but I still find this system very disorientating compared to Nix. I'm certain experienced Guixheads are long past being tripped up by this sort of stuff and might even struggle to remember that there was a time they had to do these special steps too, but as a new user it felt a bit rough, especially consdering this is Guix System, i.e. the system whose whole purpose is to be integrate Guix as much as it can.\nBack to our issue at hand. I issued sudo -s and guix pull-ed again. Once more 10-12 minutes passed indexing. But at least I could finally call guix system reconfigure /etc/config.scm. Interestingly things are much faster this time around, I saw speeds up to 30-50 Mbps. Before long the system was updated to the newest commit and I rebooted with high hopes.\nHigh hopes, that were immediately dashed when Plasma loaded in the same messed up way. At this point I started to suspect this might be an issue with the GPU driver, so I enabled the LXQT desktop environment and rebooted once more. Thankfully that one worked like a charm and I was able to boot up both Emacs (editing Scheme with GNU Nano is a pain I do not wish on anyone) and LibreWolf (Firefox's de-Mozilla-d variant).\nNot having found anything too useful in the docs, I decided to make my problem someone else's so I fired up ERC4 and connected to Libera.chat's #guix channel. After around half an hour of wait, a user by the name of Rutherther stepped up and offered me some help. We were able to figure it out that Nouveau wasn't able to drive my GPU (an RTX 5070), so his recommendation was that I should try booting with nomodeset. I did, but it sadly didn't help much either.\n4. Sympathy for the Devil\nAt this point I was out of ideas. Ideas of solving this using pure-Guix System, that is. There was still one option I wanted to avoid as long as I could, but alas, it seemed like the only option, that still had a realistic chance of working.\nFigure 3: Nonguix's official logo, self-described to be \"dark and evil\".\nEnter Nonguix, the Mr. Hyde to Guix's Dr. Jekyll, the shady guy who offers you a hit and first time's for free, the… Erm, in a nutshell, it's the repository for non-free applications and drivers packages for Guix System, basically. Interestingly enough, by Guix's own findings about 64% of users utilize the Nonguix channel, which is perhaps not \"literally everyone\", but it does paint a picture that there is still stuff out there that you simply cannot replace with FOSS software yet.\nListing 1: At the time of writing, this is all one has to do to enable Nonguix. 1: (cons* (channel\n2:       (name 'nonguix)\n3:       (url \"https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix\")\n4:       ;; Enable signature verification:\n5:       (introduction\n6:        (make-channel-introduction\n7:         \"897c1a470da759236cc11798f4e0a5f7d4d59fbc\"\n8:         (openpgp-fingerprint\n9:          \"2A39 3FFF 68F4 EF7A 3D29  12AF 6F51 20A0 22FB B2D5\"))))\n10:      %default-channels)\nEnabling the repo wasn't exactly difficult. You just paste the short excerpt from above (also found in the README) into your ~/.config/guix/channels.scm and /etc/guix/channels.scm files, guix pull, let it index to its heart's content again, and then you have access to all that is nasty (yet occasionally useful) in the world.\nI figured perhaps if Linux-libre and its free firmware couldn't deal with my GPU, then surely Linux proper with its binary blobs could. Hell, for good measure I threw in the NVIDIA transform, which is supposed to automagically translate all dependencies to use the proprietary drivers.\nFigure 4: What haste and half-reading manuals gets you…\nTurns out my eagerness was a mistake. Not only did the process take yet another half an hour (if not more, I stopped counting), upon reboot all I was met with was a kernel panic about the driver not being able to cope with the GPU it found and a massive spew of FSCK logs.\nFigure 5: 'FSCK' was indeed very close to the first words that came to my mind at this moment.\nWith no better ideas in mind, I took out my pendrive again and burned Nonguix's own pre-built ISO on it using my partner's PC. While it ultimately did get me a working system, this version has three unfortunate hindrances:\nIt was built in 2022, far before Guix's migration to Codeberg, meaning it still attempts to pull content from the unfathomably slow GNU Savannah mirror. I had to manually override my channels.scm to point at the Codeberg repo instead, but with no easy means of finding its \"channel introduction\"5, I had to pass in --disable-authentication to Guix when updating my system. A bit scary, but I trust the Codeberg repo.\nBecause of its age, I got a lot of somewhat intimidating errors about hardware not being recognized and other stuff I couldn't even decipher, but ultimately the system booted to the installer without issue.\nFor some reason while the installer itself does include Nonguix stuff, it actually does not include the repo in the resulting channels files, nor the substitution server for the project. The README has a warning about this, but if you happen to miss it, you could accidentally install a non-Nonguix Guix System (say that three times fast).\nNone of these were particularly hard to fix, however, and soon enough I was back where I started. That is to say, in a nomodeset X11 session, except this time running i3, as LXQT wasn't an available option on an installer this old. There was certainly a bit of a hacker-ish vibe to messing with code files in an environment like that, but I was honestly much more looking forward to finally having a usable desktop.\nHaving learned from my hastiness, this time I was smarter. I only enabled the full kernel and firmware blobs, without going anywhere near the NVIDIA transform. I issued another guix system reconfigure and, after having time for another tea session, my update was finally finished.\nI rebooted with tentative nervousness and… Success? Huh.\n5. Goals\nObviously there is little point in throwing Guix System on my PC and declaring success. I wanted to be able to at least reproduce the kind of workflow I'm used to using NixOS. For that, I need the following:\nA browser: preferably Firefox, as I'm not a huge fan of Chrome / Chromium,\nAn E-mail client: preferably Thunderbird,\nA basic office suite: preferably LibreOffice,\nDev environments: for Rust, Zig, Scheme, and TypeScript (with the option for more, if possible),\nEmacs: I do almost all my text editing in it these days, falling back to Neovim for quick tasks,\nDiscord: for chatting with friends,\nTelegram: for chatting with family,\nSteam: for the very rare occasions I want to game,\nNVIDIA drivers: I prefer to offload day-to-day usage to my CPU's integrated GPU, as it cuts my energy usage in half.\nOf these it was obvious that two would be relatively hard and one \"outright impossible\". The two being Steam and the drivers (as both are non-free and thus not in Guix's default repos) and the \"impossible\" one being Discord (which not even the non-free repo has packaged). But I was ready to compromise a little bit since I am requesting stuff that's explicitly against Guix's goals.\n6. Results\nFigure 6: My desktop running Wezterm packaged by me and Emacs.\nWhile there has been occasional bumps and hitches along the ride, I must say I'm very impressed with Guix System so far. Let's go through this list in order:\nBrowser: So far I'm really enjoying LibreWolf. It feels a lot snappier than Firefox and I'm really baffled how much speed I was apparently missing out on.\nE-mails: I installed Icedove, which is basically just Thunderbird without Mozilla branding. It works as expected.\nOffice suite: LibreOffice is available as expected. Not much to say about it. I guess it's interesting that Guix isn't following the usual -stale / -fresh packaging schema, but I don't really mind not having cutting edge versions of an office suite :)\nDev environments: I've only briefly toyed with development environments so far, but to me it seems like for simple use-cases it might be even easier to use than shell.nix (you don't need any sort of ceremony, just a manifest.scm file with a (specifications->manifest <list of packages>) form inside and you have a dev env ready to go.)\nEmacs: Installed just fine. I had to install emacs-vterm to make Vterm work, but all that took was the very simple process of adding the library to my home configuration and then referencing it in my Emacs config as per this Reddit post.\nDiscord: I decided to just use Discord's browser version, which works just as fine (if not better). It's trading a tiny bit of convenience in return for not having to figure out how to manually add a package for it from some random third-party source. From what I've read elsewhere Flatpak is also an option, but I prefer having just one package manager at a time.\nSteam: Installed shockingly easily. I have to really give props to the Nonguix team. I tested Portal 2 with the Nouveau driver, it is a little disheartening to see a 15 years old game6 lag, but I understand the people's hands are tied when it comes to the free drivers. After I managed to install the proprietary drivers, I was able to play even Portal RTX, which is something I never managed to get to work using NixOS.\nNVIDIA drivers: This time I actually read the docs properly and it didn't take long for me to realize the initial problem that caused my previous install to be unbootable was of course found between the chair and keyboard. This time, after making sure I enabled the open drivers and kernel mode-setting, I crossed my fingers, issued a reconfigure and it works beautifully!\n6.1. The Good\nHelpful community: While I do feel like Guix's community could be much larger (see below), the one that exists is very helpful and nice from my limited experience. In all places I've looked so far (Libera's #guix, /r/Guix, and the guix/guix Codeberg repository) I was met with genuinely kind and helpful people.\nThat is not to say I haven't seen some bad eggs, especially in posts from years ago, but I don't think there is any community without those, so I'm not going to cite this as a negative.\nHome configuration: Having guix home be a built-in, first class citizen, instead of a community made \"extension\" is excellent. Instead of needing to consult a third-party resource like Home Manager's documentation you can simply use what you already know about Guix and, if you happen to hit a wall, you can just read the official handbook which is guaranteed to always stay up to date with the rest of the system.\nPackage availability: As long as you largely use FOSS stuff (which is much easier than one might think), the amount of choice is awesome. I could basically just copy over the list of packages from my Nix config and practically everything had an equivalent.\nScheme: I'm not really a seasoned Schemer, but I have dabbled in the language previously and it feels so much better to me than Nix (the language) ever did. One great benefit of this is that it's a lot easier to start digging into package definitions to figure things out for yourself.\nThis is \"Freedom 1\" of GNU's Four Essential Freedoms in effect. Since the code is pretty much just Scheme and the different mechanisms available are fairly well documented (see caveat below), the barrier to entry is much lower than with Nix in my opinion.7\nAnother nice benefit of this is that you can use Emacs' extensive Scheme support to help your configuration. Tools like Geiser can plug right into Guix and help you find package and function names and, once you're experienced enough, debug your config/packages on the fly. I personally haven't yet achieved mastery of such level yet, but having the REPL confirm if I've entered names in correctly before running the code is already a boon.\nEase of hacking: In the \"to tinker on\" sense, rather than \"being insecure\". With Nix, merely pulling in Nixpkgs is an effort, due to the repository being massive. My otherwise beefy machine struggled to switch between branches and make commits, which doesn't exactly inspire confidence in contributing, even though it was otherwise something I was excited to do. Meanwhile, with Guix I was able to get a fully functioning development environment in 15 minutes tops, which includes cloning the repo, authenticating all commits, generating bytecode for the entire repository, and getting Emacs set up to work nice with the codebase.\nNot to mention, at the time of writing my Nixpkgs PR of guile-colorized is still not accepted, despite being open since October, 2025. Which is kind of disheartening, when the package is really trivial and has a very low blast-radius. With Guix I got an answer to an extremely noobish question on my first PR in mere hours.\nOn a separate, but related note, I also found it a lot easier to test my package in a \"live\" environment as guix pull supports a parameter called --url which you can easily point to a folder on your own PC. So once I was confident my code should work, I could just \"check out\" my local repository clone and build it like I was an end user. This let me make sure it really does work.\n6.2. The Ambiguous\nSearch: guix search not taking an extra parameter like nix search is both very convenient and a bit of a bummer.\nIts absence is not a deal breaker, but I really loved how with Nix, you could search in anything, that has a flake. Be that Nixpkgs, a repo you downloaded, a repo that's on a git forge, etc. I remember being awestruck that I could just do nix search github:mozilla/nixpkgs-mozilla and search for their builds of Firefox without having to manually check out anything.\nThe documentation: Oof, this one is a bit hard to pass definite judgment on.\nOn one hand I love the thoroughness of it all. You can get a fairly decent idea of what Guix, what it can do for your, how to use it, and how to extend it, just by reading the manual. It is evident that the Guix team and GNU in general takes its mission to educate using free software very seriously. Stuff like the Packaging tutorial make it very easy for complete beginners to hack together package definitions without needing to consult any other resource.\nOn the other hand, it really is just a manual, not a tutorial. What I mean by this is that concepts that could belong together aren't placed near each other. A simple example would be services and customizing them. Assuming, you're in one of the sub-pages of Services and you suddenly realize you want to replace/modify one of the services, you are left completely clueless how that works. You have to go to a completely different chapter and find one particular function's description and then apply what you learn there. The Guix Cookbook has some examples, but you have to know about the cookbook in the first place.\nAnd before anyone misunderstands me, I'm fine with RTFM, but in my opinion one of the preconditions of mass-appeal is having \"pre-chewed\" solutions for common problems, that don't require perusing multiple chapters.\n6.3. The Bad\nSubstitute server stability: I imagine this is an issue that only a massive bag of money could fix, but the CI/CD servers could definitely use some more processing power. It's really annoying when you're trying to test something and you're suddenly forced to wait 10-15 minutes because the server can only spare 50-100 kbps for you.\nContent out there: Clearly this isn't the Guix team's fault (and it's something I'm trying to lessen with this post, even if just a tiny bit), but it's really hard to find good quality material when it comes to Guix.\nI mean, sure, there is the excellent System Crafters tutorial series, and the odd gems like DThompson's dev env tutorial, but as a whole you're largely left to your own to trawl through the manual, IRC logs, Reddit threads, Codeberg and the previous issue tracker, etc. It's not an impossible task, especially if you're used to doing Linux things \"the hard way\", but it's certainly a far cry from such one-stop shops as the Nix Flakes book or Wombat's Book of Nix.\nGuix's own build speed: Nix excels in speed, so I was hoping Guix would be the same. Yet stuff like guix pull really bog things down. Doubly so, if you want to update not just your own guix instance, but also root's.\nClarity of commands: The fact that all concerns are lumped together (unlike Nix's many utilities) means that to the new user the many commands such as guix pull, guix {system, home} reconfigure, guix update can easily feel overwhelming and unclear what's updating/changing what. With time I'm sure you obtain a sort of mental muscle memory and you never think about it again, but starting out it's definitely a confusing part.\n7. Overall\nListing 2: My current, fairly barebones Guix home config. 1: (define-module (guix-home-config)\n2:   #:use-module (nongnu packages)\n3:   #:use-module (gnu packages)\n4:   #:use-module (gnu home)\n5:   #:use-module (gnu home services)\n6:   #:use-module (gnu home services shells)\n7:   #:use-module (gnu services)\n8:   #:use-module (gnu system shadow)\n9:   #:use-module (guix gexp))\n10:\n11: (define %packages\n12:   (list \"git\" \"openssh\" \"librewolf\" \"ripgrep\"\n13:         \"bat\" \"eza\" \"fd\" \"zoxide\" \"bc\" \"gimp\"\n14:         \"libreoffice\" \"jujutsu\" \"starship\" \"direnv\"\n15:         \"okular\" \"gwenview\" \"bitwarden-desktop\"\n16:         \"icedove-wayland\" \"telegram-desktop\"\n17:         \"emacs-vterm\" \"ispell\" \"hunspell\" \"wezterm\"))\n18:\n19: (define %nonfree-packages\n20:   (list \"steam-nvidia\"\n21:         \"mpv-nvidia\"))\n22:\n23: (define home-config\n24:   (home-environment\n25:    (packages (specifications->packages (append %nonfree-packages %packages)))\n26:    (services\n27:     (append\n28:      (list\n29:       (service home-bash-service-type\n30:                (home-bash-configuration\n31:                  (aliases '((\"ls\" . \"eza\")))\n32:                  (bashrc (list (local-file \"./bashrc.sh\")))))\n33:\n34:       (service home-files-service-type\n35:                `((\".guile\" ,%default-dotguile)\n36:                  (\".Xdefaults\" ,%default-xdefaults)))\n37:\n38:       (service home-xdg-configuration-files-service-type\n39:                `((\"gdb/gdbinit\" ,%default-gdbinit)\n40:                  (\"nano/nanorc\" ,%default-nanorc))))\n41:\n42:      %base-home-services))))\n43:\n44: home-config\nIn a nutshell I'm very positively surprised by Guix System. After struggling so much with it years ago, this time everything just clicked after a much shorter battle. So much so that I'm happy to make it my daily driver for the foreseeable future. Beyond the slightly slower execution speed, I'm getting a comparable experience to NixOS, with all the usual pros a declarative environment brings and without having to put up with Nixlang.\nMy only recurring issues so far are the occasional slow download speeds and that I have to start my kernel in nomodeset because otherwise the graphical environment crashes without me being able to switch to a TTY. It's a bummer, but honestly, I'm not too bothered by it so far. I'm trusting a driver update will fix it soon enough and, if not, it's not exactly difficult to throw in a kernel parameter into your config.\nI'm hoping to do a followup post about packaging in Guix, because I've been dipping my toes into it by trying to package Wezterm and the journey there was similarly arduous as installing the system itself.\nTill then, thank you for reading and see you next time!\n8. Notes\nThe stuff you see below are all I managed to write down mid-process. Some of these I threw it into the file from Nano, some from half-broken X11 sessions. Because of this, it's not exactly well-edited, but I hope it might provide a glimpse into my mind at the time.\nThe installer is decently simple\nI appreciate the warning about incompatible hardware\n2.5 hours at least to install (mirrors throttle connection to 50kbps)\nKDE is simply not working out of the box (titlebars are missing)\nIt seems to also default to X11, when I'm looking for Wayland\nThe first guix pull is horrendously slow\nWayland continues to elude me, seems to be an Nvidia issue\nIRC recommends nomodeset, doesn't help\nTry enabling Nonguix, system no longer boots\nTry installing using the Nonguix ISO\nLots of errors, terribly old release\nHaving to guix pull myself to the present day again\nAlso I'm missing the introduction, so I have to run it using --disable-authentication, not great, but I trust the Codeberg repo\nAt least the download speed seems to have normalized\nIt isn't entirely clear when you have to use sudo\nRunning i3 on a shitty low-res has a certain vibe to it, but I'd prefer a system working out of the box\nFootnotes:\n1\nWell, if only life was so easy. What I mean here is that on my personal computer, I've not had Windows since about 2015. For work purposes my hands are currently chained to MacOS (though even there I use a Debian-based container).\n2\nNo disrespect to Ubuntu-users, past and present! My opinion at the time was quite ignorant and nowadays I far more appreciate an easy to maintain system as you'll see from the rest of this post.\n3\nIt's merely a hunch, but it feels to me that the servers are far slower during the (Central-European) night. During midday, I get really good download speeds, but after around 8 PM, it slows to a crawl.\n4\nWhich, for the uninitiated, is an IRC client built into Emacs. This editor continues to wow me every day.\n5\nI probably could have figured it out in time. But at this point I was a bit exasperated and I really didn't want to type in an 10x4 character hexadecimal code by hand.\n6\nGoodness gracious, Portal 2 is almost 15 years old…\n7\nThat being said, my Nix experience was still very much helpful here. Understanding stuff such as build phases, why packages need to be patched and how this usually works, and what the different build flags mean is pretty much a must if you want to attain an understanding deeper than just \"kinda getting it.\"",

Later I attempted to make some patches into the repository.\nI checked the documentation and learned that I have to sign an Oracle\nContributor Agreement before submitting patches to OpenJDK. At that time, I\ndreamed that it was just a pretty normal CLA, like the ones I signed for other\nprojects and shall just take at most several days.\nA few days later, I received an email asking me to update some information in\nthe agreement. I did. After that, I have sent 5 emails to\nopensource_ww_grp at oracle.com asking if there was anything wrong (once a month\nfrom January to May). For each of my emails, I got a reply, saying that they\n\"sincerely apologize\" and \"@Dalibor Topic Can you please review...\", with no\nactual progress being made. Now it has been (more than) one year since I\nsubmitted my first OCA submission. And I have been tired of \"/touch\"-ing my PR\nonce a month.\nI wonder if there is a reason for not reviewing my OCA submission. I do live\nin Chinese Mainland but I have no contractual or subordinate or teacher-\nstudent relationship with any entities that are restricted by the US import/\nexport control laws (according to OpenSanctions). If you think that I have\nsuch a relationship or should be rejected for any other reasons, please simply\nreject my OCA submission, instead of hanging it for months.\nAs I no longer have enough interest and spare time to work on OpenJDK, I\ndecided to give up upstreaming those patches.\nIf anyone is interested in them, please feel free to pick up and submit these\npatches, most of which are small but I believe they are useful.\nAs OCA requires that \"each contribution that you submit is and shall be an\noriginal work of authorship\", you may rewrite my patches from scratch so it is\nan original work, and you don't need to sign my name or ping me.\nI would like to give a list of the patches that I wanted to upstream but\nfailed:\n- Checks if \"llvm-config\" is broken:\nhttps://github.com/AOSC-Tracking/jdk/commit/\n6a8b12b1ad700d994a2803de593ca06e698ef1a9\n- Extend default thread stack size for zero:\nThis addresses the stack overflow exception in javac when building JDK 24 with\nzero variants.\nhttps://github.com/AOSC-Tracking/jdk/commit/\n4534fcaafc149f649105dc9914c7cf4aaf8c802c\nhttps://www.mail-archive.com/build-dev@openjdk.org/msg14818.html\nSome patches that are not for the upstream OpenJDK but Loongson's fork of JDK\nand were also blocked by OCA:\nhttps://github.com/loongson/jdk/pull/134\nhttps://github.com/loongson/jdk/pull/126\nhttps://github.com/loongson/jdk/pull/125\nhttps://github.com/loongson/jdk/pull/135\nhttps://github.com/loongson/jdk/pull/136\nhttps://github.com/AOSC-Tracking/jdk/commit/\n913dcb2b2759437876ae3a40a1b074eeb1bfe09f\nhttps://github.com/AOSC-Tracking/jdk/commit/\ncaba8e6de73fd9ffa078d6c257d6be8500b9d16a\nBest wishes,\nBye.\n--\nBingwu Zhang (a.k.a. xtex) @ Sat, 31 Jan 2026 08:42:31 +0000\nPrevious message (by thread): RFR: 8372942: AArch64: Set JVM flags for Neoverse V3AE core [v2]\nNext message (by thread): Giving up upstream-ing my patches & feel free to pick them up\nMessages sorted by:\n[ date ]\n[ thread ]\n[ subject ]\n[ author ]\nMore information about the hotspot-dev\nmailing list",

Vaughan-Nichols\nFri 30 Jan 2026                                     //\n11:45 UTC\nOpinion I'm an eighth-generation American, and let me tell you, I wouldn't trust my data, secrets, or services to a US company these days for love or money. Under our current government, we're simply not trustworthy.\nIn the Trump‑redux era of 2026, European enterprises are finally taking data seriously, and that means packing up from Redmond-by-Seattle and moving their most sensitive workloads home. This isn't just compliance theater; it's a straight‑up national economic security play.\nOpen source's new mission: Rebuild a continent's tech stack\nREAD MORE\nEurope's digital sovereignty paranoia, long waved off as regulatory chatter, is now feeding directly into procurement decisions. Gartner told The Reg last year that IT spending in Europe is set to grow by 11 percent in 2026, hitting $1.4 trillion, with a big chunk rolling into \"sovereign cloud\" options and on‑prem/edge architectures.\nThe kicker? Fully 61 percent of European CIOs and tech leaders say they want to increase their use of local cloud providers. More than half say geopolitics will prevent them from leaning further on US‑based hyperscalers.\nThe American hypercloud vendors have figured this out. AWS recently made its European Sovereign Cloud available. This AWS cloud, Amazon claims, is \"entirely located within the EU, and physically and logically separate from other AWS Regions.\" On top of that, EU residents will \"independently operate it\" and \"be backed by strong technical controls, sovereign assurances, and legal protections designed to meet the needs of European governments and enterprises for sensitive data.\"\nMany EU-based companies aren't pleased with this Euro-washing of American hypercloud services. The Cloud Infrastructure Service Providers in Europe (CISPE) trade association accuses the EU Cloud Sovereignty Framework of being set up to favor the incumbent (American) hypercloud providers.\nThey're not wrong.\nYou don't need a DEA warrant or a Justice Department subpoena to see the trend: Europe's 90‑plus‑percent dependency on US cloud infrastructure, as former European Commission advisor Cristina Caffarra put it, is a single‑shock‑event security nightmare waiting to rupture the EU's digital stability.\nSeriously. What will you do if Washington decides to unplug you? Say Trump gets up on the wrong side of the bed and decides to invade Greenland. There goes NATO, and in all the saber-rattling leading up to the 10th Mountain Division being shipped to Nuuk, he orders American companies to cut their services to all EU countries and the UK.\nWhen AI 'builds a browser,' check the repo before believing the hype\nJust because Linus Torvalds vibe codes doesn't mean it's a good idea\nThe most durable tech is boring, old, and everywhere\nWhat the Linux desktop really needs to challenge Windows\nWith the way things are going, they're not going to say no. I mean, CEOs Tim Cook of Apple, Eric Yuan of Zoom, Lisa Su of AMD, and – pay attention – Amazon's Andy Jassy all went obediently to watch a feature-length White House screening of Melania, the universally-loathed, 104‑minute Amazon‑produced documentary about First Lady Melania Trump.\nEurope's cloud challenge: Building an Airbus for the digital age\nREAD MORE\nSure, that's a silly example, but for American companies to do business today, they're kowtowing to Trump. Or, take a far more serious example, when Minnesota company CEOs called for \"de-escalation\" in the state, there was not one word about ICE or the government's role in the bloodshed. It was the corporate equivalent of the mealy-mouthed \"thoughts and prayers\" American right-wingers always say after a US school shooting.\nSome companies have already figured out which way the wind is blowing. Airbus, the European aerospace titan, has put out a €50 million, decade‑long tender to migrate its mission‑critical applications to a \"sovereign European cloud.\" Airbus wants its whole stack – data at rest, data in transit, logging, IAM, and security‑monitoring infrastructure – all rooted in EU law and overseen by EU operators. As Catherine Jestin, Airbus's executive vice president of digital, told The Register: \"We want to ensure this information remains under European control.\"\nWho can blame them? Thanks to the American CLOUD Act and related US surveillance statutes, US‑headquartered providers must hand over European data regardless of where the bytes sit. Exhibit A is that Microsoft has already conceded that it cannot guarantee data independence from US law enforcement. Airbus is betting that \"data residency on paper\" from AWS‑styled \"EU sections\" is not enough. Real sovereignty demands EU‑owned and run operations with full contractual and legal firewalls. Sure, your data may live in Frankfurt, but your fate still rests in Seattle, Redmond, or Mountain View if an American company owns your cloud provider.\nBesides, do you really want some Trump apparatchik getting their hands on your data? I mean, this is a government where Madhu Gottumukkala, the acting director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, uploaded sensitive data into ChatGPT!\nUK urged to unplug from US tech giants as digital sovereignty fears grow\nREAD MORE\nIn response, Brussels is pushing an open source‑led exit from hyperscaler lock‑in. Ministries are standardizing on Nextcloud‑style collaboration stacks instead of Microsoft 365 to fund Euro‑native clouds via the European Cloud Alliance. Some countries, like France, are already shoving Zoom, Teams, and other US videoconferencing platforms out the door in favor of a local service.\nIf you're running an EU‑based firm in 2026, the takeaway isn't that AWS‑in‑Frankfurt is evil; it's that for certain workloads, especially national security, industrial IP, or high‑profile consumer data franchises, EU‑native cloud and services are no longer a nice‑to‑have but a business continuity plan requirement.\nIt's time to get serious about digital sovereignty. The clock is ticking, and there's no telling when Trump will go off. ®\nShare\nMore about\nData\nDigital sovereignty\nEurope\nMore like these\n×\nMore about\nData\nDigital sovereignty\nEurope\nMicrosoft\nUnited States of America\nNarrower topics\nActive Directory\nAlabama\nAlbania\nArmenia\nAustria\nAzerbaijan\nAzure\nBelarus\nBelgium\nBing\nBSoD\nBulgaria\nCalifornia\nCentral Intelligence Agency\nCroatia\nCross-border data flow\nCyprus\nCzech Republic\nDenmark\nDOGE\nEstonia\nExcel\nExchange Server\nFederal government of the United States\nFinland\nFive Eyes\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act\nFrance\nGeorgia\nGermany\nGrafana\nGreece\nHoloLens\nHungary\nIceland\nInternet Explorer\nIreland\nItaly\nKazakhstan\nLatvia\nLiechtenstein\nLinkedIn\nLithuania\nLuxembourg\nMalta\nMicrosoft 365\nMicrosoft Build\nMicrosoft Edge\nMicrosoft Fabric\nMicrosoft Ignite\nMicrosoft Office\nMicrosoft Surface\nMicrosoft Teams\nMonaco\nMontenegro\n.NET\nNetherlands\nNew Mexico\nNew York\nNorway\nOffice 365\nOS/2\nOutlook\nPatch Tuesday\nPluton\nPoland\nPortugal\nRomania\nRussia\nSan Marino\nSerbia\nSharePoint\nSkype\nSlovakia\nSlovenia\nSpain\nSQL Server\nSweden\nSwitzerland\nTurkey\nUkraine\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States Armed Forces\nUnited States Department of Commerce\nUS Treasury\nVirginia\nVisual Studio\nVisual Studio Code\nWindows\nWindows 10\nWindows 11\nWindows 7\nWindows 8\nWindows Server\nWindows Server 2003\nWindows Server 2008\nWindows Server 2012\nWindows Server 2013\nWindows Server 2016\nWindows Subsystem for Linux\nWindows XP\nXbox\nXbox 360\nBroader topics\nBill Gates\nContinent\nLaw\nMore about\nShare\n121\nCOMMENTS\nMore about\nData\nDigital sovereignty\nEurope\nMore like these\n×\nMore about\nData\nDigital sovereignty\nEurope\nMicrosoft\nUnited States of America\nNarrower topics\nActive Directory\nAlabama\nAlbania\nArmenia\nAustria\nAzerbaijan\nAzure\nBelarus\nBelgium\nBing\nBSoD\nBulgaria\nCalifornia\nCentral Intelligence Agency\nCroatia\nCross-border data flow\nCyprus\nCzech Republic\nDenmark\nDOGE\nEstonia\nExcel\nExchange Server\nFederal government of the United States\nFinland\nFive Eyes\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act\nFrance\nGeorgia\nGermany\nGrafana\nGreece\nHoloLens\nHungary\nIceland\nInternet Explorer\nIreland\nItaly\nKazakhstan\nLatvia\nLiechtenstein\nLinkedIn\nLithuania\nLuxembourg\nMalta\nMicrosoft 365\nMicrosoft Build\nMicrosoft Edge\nMicrosoft Fabric\nMicrosoft Ignite\nMicrosoft Office\nMicrosoft Surface\nMicrosoft Teams\nMonaco\nMontenegro\n.NET\nNetherlands\nNew Mexico\nNew York\nNorway\nOffice 365\nOS/2\nOutlook\nPatch Tuesday\nPluton\nPoland\nPortugal\nRomania\nRussia\nSan Marino\nSerbia\nSharePoint\nSkype\nSlovakia\nSlovenia\nSpain\nSQL Server\nSweden\nSwitzerland\nTurkey\nUkraine\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States Armed Forces\nUnited States Department of Commerce\nUS Treasury\nVirginia\nVisual Studio\nVisual Studio Code\nWindows\nWindows 10\nWindows 11\nWindows 7\nWindows 8\nWindows Server\nWindows Server 2003\nWindows Server 2008\nWindows Server 2012\nWindows Server 2013\nWindows Server 2016\nWindows Subsystem for Linux\nWindows XP\nXbox\nXbox 360\nBroader topics\nBill Gates\nContinent\nLaw\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news",

In my YouTube channel, for some time now I started to refer to the process of writing software using AI assistance (soon to become just \"the process of writing software\", I believe) with the term \"Automatic Programming\".\nIn case you didn't notice, automatic programming produces vastly different results with the same LLMs depending on the human that is guiding the process with their intuition, design, continuous steering and idea of software.\nPlease, stop saying \"Claude vibe coded this software for me\". Vibe coding is the process of generating software using AI without being part of the process at all. You describe what you want in very general terms, and the LLM will produce whatever happens to be the first idea/design/code it would spontaneously, given the training, the specific sampling that happened to dominate in that run, and so forth. The vibe coder will, at most, report things not working or not in line with what they expected.\nWhen the process is actual software production where you know what is going on, remember: it is the software *you* are producing. Moreover remember that the pre-training data, while not the only part where the LLM learns (RL has its big weight) was produced by humans, so we are not appropriating something else. We can pretend AI generated code is \"ours\", we have the right to do so. Pre-training is, actually, our collective gift that allows many individuals to do things they could otherwise never do, like if we are now linked in a collective mind, in a certain way.\nThat said, if vibe coding is the process of producing software without much understanding of what is going on (which has a place, and democratizes software production, so it is totally ok with me), automatic programming is the process of producing software that attempts to be high quality and strictly following the producer's vision of the software (this vision is multi-level: can go from how to do, exactly, certain things, at a higher level, to stepping in and tell the AI how to write a certain function), with the help of AI assistance. Also a fundamental part of the process is, of course, *what* to do.\nI'm a programmer, and I use automatic programming. The code I generate in this way is mine. My code, my output, my production. I, and you, can be proud.\nIf you are not completely convinced, think to Redis. In Redis there is not much technical novelty, especially at its start it was just a sum of basic data structures and networking code that every competent system programmer could write. So, why it became a very useful piece of software? Because of the ideas and visions it contained.\nProgramming is now automatic, vision is not (yet).\nblog comments powered by Disqus",

          "body_text": "Mark Thomson takes the reins at the CERN particle-physics lab, which recently received $1bn in private donations for its next collider project, as Michael Banks reports\nBigger and better: The Large Hadron Collider at CERN will shut down later this year to make way for a major upgrade – the High-Luminosity LHC (courtesy: CERN)\nThe CERN particle-physics lab near Geneva has received $1bn from private donors towards the construction of the Future Circular Collider (FCC). The cash marks the first time in the lab’s 72-year history that individuals and philanthropic foundations have agreed to support a major CERN project. If built, the FCC would be the successor to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where the Higgs boson was discovered.\nCERN originally released a four-volume conceptual design report for the FCC in early 2019, with more detail included in a three-volume feasibility study that came out last year. It calls for a giant tunnel some 90.7 km in circumference – roughly three times as long as the LHC  – that would be built about 200 m underground on average.\nThe FCC has been recommended as the preferred option for the next flagship collider at CERN in the ongoing process to update the European Strategy for Particle Physics, which will be passed over to the  CERN Council in May 2026.If the plans are given the green light by CERN Council in 2028, construction on the FCC electron-positron machine, dubbed FCC-ee, would begin in 2030. It would start operations in 2047, a few years after the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) closes down, and run for about 15 years until the early 2060s.\nThe FCC-ee would focus on creating a million Higgs particles in total to allow physicists to study its properties with an accuracy an order of magnitude better that possible with the LHC. The FCC feasibility study then calls for a hadron machine, dubbed FCC-hh, to replace the FCC-ee in the existing 91 km tunnel. It would be a “discovery machine”, smashing together protons at high energy – about 85 TeV – with the aim of creating new particles. If built, the FCC-hh will begin operation in 2073 and run to the end of the century.\nThe funding model for the FCC-ee, which is expected to have a price tag of about $18bn, is still a work in progress. But it is estimated that at least two-thirds of the construction costs will come from CERN’s 24 member states with the rest needing to be found elsewhere. One option to plug that gap is private donations and in late December CERN received a significant boost from several organizations including the Breakthrough Prize Foundation, the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fund for Strategic Innovation, and the entrepreneurs John Elkann and Xavier Niel. Together, they pledged a total of $1bn towards the FCC-ee.\nCostas Fountas, president of the CERN Council, says CERN is “extremely grateful” for the interest. “This once again demonstrates CERN’s relevance and positive impact on society, and the strong interest in CERN’s future that exists well beyond our own particle physics community,” he notes.\nEric Schmidt, who founded Google, claims that he and Wendy Schmidt were “inspired by the ambition of this project and by what it could mean for the future of humanity”. The FCC, he believes, is an instrument that “could push the boundaries of human knowledge and deepen our understanding of the fundamental laws of the Universe” and could lead to technologies that could benefit society “in profound ways” from medicine to computing to sustainable energy.\nThe cash promised has been welcomed by outgoing CERN director-general Fabiola Gianotti. “It’s the first time in history that private donors wish to partner with CERN to build an extraordinary research instrument that will allow humanity to take major steps forward in our understanding of fundamental physics and the universe,” she said. “I am profoundly grateful to them for their generosity, vision, and unwavering commitment to knowledge and exploration.”\nFurther boost\nThe cash comes a few months after the Circular Electron–Positron Collider (CEPC) – a rival collider to the FCC-ee that also involves building a huge 100 km tunnel to study the Higgs in unprecedented detail – was not considered for inclusion in China’s next five-year plan, which runs from 2026 to 2030. There has been much discussion in China about whether the CEPC is the right project for the country, with the collider facing criticism from particle physicist and Nobel laureate Chen-Ning Yang, before he died last year.\nWang Yifang of the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) in Beijing says they will submit the CEPC for consideration again in 2030 unless FCC is officially approved before then. But for particle theorist John Ellis from Kings College London, China’s decision to effectively put the CEPC on the back burner  “certainly simplifies the FCC discussion”. “However, an opportunity for growing the world particle physics community has been lost, or at least deferred [by the decision],” Ellis told Physics World.\nEllis adds, however, that he would welcome China’s participation in the FCC. “Their accelerator and detector [technical design reviews] show that they could bring a lot to the table, if the political obstacles can be overcome,” he says.\nRead more\nCERN releases plans for the ‘most extraordinary instrument ever built’\nHowever, if the FCC-ee goes ahead China could perhaps make significant “in-kind” contributions rather like those that occur with the ITER experimental fusion reactor, which is currently being built in France. In this case, instead of cash payments, the countries provide components, equipment and other materials.\nThose considerations and more will now fall to the British physicist Mark Thomson, who took over from Gianotti as CERN director-general on 1 January for a five-year term. As well as working on funding requirements for the FCC-ee, top of his in-tray will actually be shutting down the LHC in June to make way for further work on the HL-LHC, which involves installing powerful new superconducting magnets and improving the detection.\nAbout 90% of the 27 km LHC accelerator will be affected by the upgrade with a major part being to replace the magnets in the final focus systems of the two large experiments, ATLAS and CMS. These magnets will take the incoming beams and then focus them down to less than 10 µm in cross section. The upgrade includes the installation of brand new state-of-the-art niobium-tin (Nb3Sn) superconducting focusing magnets.\nThe HL-LHC will probably not turn on until 2030, at which time Thomson’s term will nearly be over, but that doesn’t deter him from leading the world’s foremost particle-physics lab. “It’s an incredibly exciting project,” Thomson told the Guardian. “It’s more interesting than just sitting here with the machine hammering away.”\nWant to read more?\nRegistration is free, quick and easy\nNote: The verification e-mail to complete your account registration should arrive immediately.

          "body_text": "We have ipinfo at home or how to geolocate IPs in your CLI using latency\nTLDR: I made a CLI tool that can resolve an IP address to a country, US state and even a city. https://github.com/jimaek/geolocation-tool\nIt works well and confirms ipinfo's findings.\nRecently, I read how ipinfo finally proved what most technical people assumed: VPN providers don't actually maintain a crazy amount of infrastructure in hundreds of countries. They simply fake the IP geolocation by intentionally providing wrong location data to ARIN, RIPE, and Geo DB providers via geofeeds.\nThey achieved their results using a novel approach compared to other geo IP providers. Based on their blog and HackerNews comments, they built a large probe network and used it to trace and ping every (or most) IP addresses on the internet.\nThis latency and hop data, most likely along with advanced algorithms and data cross-reference, provides a reliable way of correctly detecting the physical geolocation of an IP address, without relying on faked data available in public sources.\nThis is a very interesting approach that makes total sense, and I'm sure their clients appreciate it and heavily rely on it.\nWhile I can't ping every single IP address on the internet from hundreds of locations just yet, I can do it to a limited subset using Globalping. So I decided to try it out and see if I can replicate their results and build a small tool to allow anyone to do the same.\nGlobalping is an open-source, community-powered project that allows users to self-host container-based probes. These probes then become part of our public network, which allows anyone to use them to run network testing tools such as ping and traceroute.\nAt the moment, the network has more than 3000 probes, which in theory should be plenty to geolocate almost any IP address down to a country and even a US state level.\nTo automate and simplify this process, I made a little CLI tool using the globalping-ts library. My original idea was simple:\nAccept a single IP as input\nPing it a few times per continent to select the continent\nThen ping the IP from many different probes on that continent\nGroup and sort the results; the country with the lowest latency should be the correct one\nAnd as a bonus, repeat the same process for USA states if the winning country was the US\nEssentially, what I had to do was simply create a few measurements and pass the location I needed using Globalping’s magic field, which would automatically figure out what I was looking for and select a few pseudo-random probes that fit the location and limit.\nNow initially, I used ping with 2 packets to run all measurements as quickly as possible, but I quickly realized it wasn’t a good idea as most networks block ICMP traffic. Next, I tried switching to TCP-based ping, which required trying a few popular ports to get it to work. I quickly realized this was too complicated and unreliable and switched to traceroute.\nIt worked perfectly. Even though traceroute uses ICMP by default, it did not matter to me if the target IP’s network allowed ICMP or not, I simply analyzed the latency of the last available hop. Even if you block ICMP, your upstream most likely allows it, and in most cases, it’s located in the same country.\nOf course, this means the resulting data is not 100% perfect. A better approach would be to analyze each IP using different methods, including TCP and UDP-based traceroute on different ports, and expand to the last few hops instead of just one. Maybe even try to figure out the location of the registered ASNs and use a weights system in combination with public whois info in order to “vote” for the right location based on different inputs. Probably even mark low certainty IPs to be retested with a double amount of probes. (end of rant)\nBut that’s something for a commercial provider to figure out, which it seems they did.\nFor continent detection, I decided to use just 5 probes per continent; the results were extremely accurate. Although for IPs just on the \"border\" of continents it might be ineffective, a higher amount of probes would generate better results. For this use case, it was good enough.\nMy home IP in central Europe was too easy to detect:\nPhase 1: Detecting continent...\nNorth America: 137.18 ms\nEurope: 32.39 ms\nAsia: 174.54 ms\nSouth America: 215.08 ms\nOceania: 244.15 ms\nAfrica: 156.83 ms\nIn phase 2, all we need to do is run a single measurement with the winning continent as the location and a higher limit. Initially, I started with 250 probes with great accuracy.\nEventually, I decided to drop down to 50 as the default. Based on my tests, the results continued to look really good, and it would allow the tool to be run even without authentication, as the Globalping API allows 250 tests per hour per IP and 50 probes per measurement.\nAlthough I recommend registering for a free account at https://dash.globalping.io/ and authenticating with a token to get up to 500 tests per hour and run more tests.\nNote: If you need more tests than that, you can either host a probe to generate passive credits to be used as tests, or donate via GitHub Sponsors. We will automatically detect it and credit your account.\nPhase 2: Detecting country...\nMeasuring from 50 probes...\n[████████████████████████████████████████] 100.0%   50/50 - Best: PL (7.29 ms)\nTop 3 Locations:\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1..

Although I’m sure someone smarter could use a formula to geolocate IPs with even fewer probes and higher accuracy.\nFor phase 3, we want to resolve the US to a specific state or territory, just like ipinfo did, and luckily they even provided a few sample IPs and locations to benchmark against during testing.\nAgain, this was as simple as creating a new measurement with the USA as the location. I used 50 probes as the default limit and tested the NordVPN IP advertised as Bahamas but resolved to Miami by ipinfo.\nPhase 3: Detecting US state...\nMeasuring from 50 probes...\n[████████████████████████████████████████] 100.0%   50/50 - Best: FL (0.45 ms)\nTop 3 Locations:\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1.

But how accurate can this system be? Can we expand it to show the city too?\nLet's make a new phase, which again, will simply set the resulting country or state as the location and extract the city of the probe with the lowest latency. Here, since there are too many possible cities and towns per state and country, I expect the accuracy to be low and only point to the closest major hub. But in theory, this should be more than enough for use cases like routing or performance debugging.\nAnd here we go, the same result ipinfo got\nPhase 4: Detecting city...\nMeasuring from 36 probes...\n[████████████████████████████████████████] 100.0%   36/36 - Best: Miami (0.00 ms)\nTop 3 Locations:\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1.

Tampa, Florida, USA                      5.85 ms\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════\nLocation: Miami, Florida, United States\nMinimum Latency: 0.00 ms\nConfidence: Very High\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════\nThe current results are good but could be better. The main problem is with how the magic field works: when setting, for example, 'Europe' as the location, it tries to spread the tests across all European probes but does not guarantee that every single country is going to be included.\nThis results in inconsistencies where a probe in the same country as the target IP was not selected, and so the tool assumes the IP is located in a different neighbouring country.\nTo fix this and make the results more consistent, you would need to change the selection logic and manually set every country per continent and US state. By passing the full list of countries/states to the Globalping API, you ensure that at least one probe in that location is going to be selected. Additionally, you fully control the number of probes per location, which is very important to control the accuracy.\nFor example, North America technically contains 43 countries and territories. This means you can't just set a limit of one probe per country, it is not enough to properly understand the latency to the target IP from the disproportionately larger USA. A better limit would be around 200 probes for the USA, 20 for Canada, and 10 for Mexico.\nBut the goal of this tool was to use a minimum amount of probes to allow unauthenticated users to test it out. The current approach works great, it is simple to implement and it is very easy to control the accuracy by simply setting a higher limit of probes.\nOverall, latency-based geolocation detection seems to be a great way to verify the location of any IP as long as you have enough vantage points. It will most likely fall apart in regions with minimal or no coverage.\nThe tool itself is open source and you can run it like this:\ngeolocate $IP\nYou can also use the –limit parameter to use more probes per phase. But be careful as it applies the set value to all phases and this will very quickly eat through your limit.

          "body_text": "5,500-Year-Old Sumerian Star Map Recorded the Impact of a Massive Asteroid\njulia Haldoupis\nEstimated read time\n5 min read\nJanuary 10, 2024\n5,500-Year-Old Sumerian Star Map Recorded the Impact of a Massive Asteroid\nFor more than 150 years scientists have tried to solve the mystery of a notorious cuneiform clay tablet that reveals that in the past the impact case of so-called Köfel was detected. The circular stone-cast tablet was discovered in the late 1800s from the 650 BC King Ashurbanipal ‘s underground library in Nineveh, Iraq.\nData processing, which was long believed to be an Assyrian tablet, mirrored the sky over Mesopotamia in 3300 BC and proved to be much more ancient Sumerian origin.\nThe tablet is the first astronomical instrument, the “Astrolabe.”  It consists of a segmented, disk-shaped star chart with marked units of angle measure inscribed upon the rim.\nUnfortunately considerable parts of the planisphere on this tablet are missing (approximately 40%), damage which dates to the sacking of Nineveh. The reverse of the tablet is not inscribed.\nStill under study by modern scholars, the cuneiform tablet in the British Museum collection No K8538 (known as “the Planisphere”) provides extraordinary proof for the existence of sophisticated Sumerian astronomy.\nIn 2008 two authors, Alan Bond and Mark Hempsell published a book about the tablet called “A Sumerian Observation of the Kofels’ Impact Event”.\nRaising a storm in archaeological circles, they re-translated the cuneiform text and asserted the tablet records an ancient asteroid strike, the Köfels’ Impact, which struck Austria sometime around 3100 BC.\nThe giant landslide centred at Köfels in Austria is 500m thick and five kilometres in diameter and has long been a mystery since geologists first looked at it in the 19th century.\nThe conclusion drawn by research in the middle 20th century was that it must be due to a very large meteor impact because of the evidence of crushing pressures and explosions. But this view lost favor as a much better understanding of impact sites developed in the late 20th century.\nIn the case of Köfels there is no crater, so to modern eyes it does not look as an impact site should look. However, the evidence that puzzled the earlier researchers remains unexplained by the view that it is just another landslide.\nSo what is the connection between the sophisticated Sumerian star chart discovered in the underground library in Nineveh and mysterious impact that took place in Austria?\nExamination of the clay tablet reveals that it is an astronomical work as it has drawings of constellations on it and the text has known constellation names. It has attracted a lot of attention but in over a hundred years nobody has come up with a convincing explanation as to what it is.\nWith modern computer programs that can simulate trajectories and reconstruct the night sky thousands of years ago the researchers have established what the Planisphere tablet refers to. It is a copy of the night notebook of a Sumerian astronomer as he records the events in the sky before dawn on 29 June 3123 BC (Julian calendar).\nHalf the tablet records planet positions and cloud cover, the same as any other night, but the other half of the tablet records an object large enough for its shape to be noted even though it is still in space.\nThe astronomers made an accurate note of its trajectory relative to the stars, which to an error better than one degree is consistent with an impact at Köfels.\nThe observation suggests the asteroid is over a kilometer in diameter and the original orbit about the Sun was an Aten type, a class of asteroids that orbit close to the Earth, that are resonant with the Earth’s orbit.\nThis trajectory explains why there is no crater at Köfels. The incoming angle was very low (six degrees) and means the asteroid clipped a mountain called Gamskogel above the town of Längenfeld, 11 kilometers from Köfels, and this caused the asteroid to explode before it reached its final impact point. As it traveled down the valley it became a fireball, around five kilometers in diameter (the size of the landslide).\nWhen it hit Köfels it created enormous pressures that pulverized the rock and caused the landslide but because it was no longer a solid object it did not create a classic impact crater.\nMark Hempsell, discussing the Köfels event, said: “Another conclusion can be made from the trajectory. The back plume from the explosion (the mushroom cloud) would be bent over the Mediterranean Sea re-entering the atmosphere over the Levant, Sinai, and Northern Egypt.\n“The ground heating though very short would be enough to ignite any flammable material – including human hair and clothes. It is probable more people died under the plume than in the Alps due to the impact blast.”\nIn other words, the remarkable ancient star map shows that the Sumerians made an observation of an Aten asteroid over a kilometer in diameter that impacted Köfels in Austria in the early morning of 29th June 3123 BC.\nCategories\nAncient History\nTags:\nAlan Bond",

          "body_text": "Musk's Starlink updates privacy policy to allow consumer data to train AI             David Jeans and Joey Roulette   Sat, January 31, 2026 at 8:08 AM GMT+9 2 min read                       In this article:         XAAI.PVT                 By David Jeans and Joey Roulette   NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) revised its Starlink privacy policy to allow the use of customer data for AI training, a shift that ​could bolster Elon Musk's AI ambitions.   Ahead of a blockbuster IPO planned for later this year, ‌SpaceX is in talks to merge with Musk’s AI company, xAI (XAAI.PVT), a deal first reported by Reuters on Thursday. SpaceX, already the ‌world’s most valuable private company, could reach a value of more than $1 trillion after the IPO.              Starlink updated its Global Privacy Policy on January 15, according to the Starlink website. The policy includes new details stating that unless a user opts out, Starlink data may be used “to train our machine learning or artificial intelligence ⁠models” and could be shared with ‌the company’s service providers and “third-party collaborators,” without providing further details.   A previous version of the privacy policy, an archived version from November and reviewed by Reuters, did not ‍contain language about AI training on Starlink data.   SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.   Starlink collects vast amounts of user data, spanning location information, credit card information, contact information and user IP ​addresses. It also collects so-called communication data, which includes audio and visual information, data in shared ‌files, and “inferences we may make from other personal information we collect,” according to its global privacy policy.          The policy did not make clear exactly what data would be used to train AI. The move has raised concerns among privacy advocates and consumer rights groups, which argue that using personal data to train AI risks expanding surveillance and creates new avenues for misuse.   “It certainly raises my eyebrow and would make ⁠me concerned if I was a Starlink user,” said Anupam ​Chander, a technology law professor at Georgetown University. “Often there's perfectly ​legitimate uses of your data, but it doesn’t have a clear limit to what kind of uses it will be put to.”   Musk's xAI, most recently valued at $230 billion ‍after a recent funding round, ⁠is currently developing its Grok LLM chatbot and also owns X, the social media platform.   The potential merger with xAI would turbocharge the space company’s deployment of AI-powered services, while giving xAI ⁠vast new data sets to train its models on, including communication data. Starlink, a network of more than 9,000 satellites, ‌currently provides internet connection to more than 9 million users.

The protagonists of this story were gravely concerned about how mainstream mathematical methods were transforming their world—somewhat akin to our current-day concerns about how digital algorithms are transforming ours. But a key difference was their straightforward moral and political reading of those mathematical methods. By contrast, in our own era we seem to think that mathematics offers entirely neutral tools for ordering and reordering the world—we have, in other words, forgotten something that was obvious to them.In this essay, I’ll use the case of revolutionary Naples to argue that the rise of a new and allegedly neutral mathematics—characterized by rigor and voluntary restriction—was a mathematical response to pressing political problems. Specifically, it was a response to the question of how to stabilize social order after the turbulence of the French Revolution. Mathematics, I argue, provided the logical infrastructure for the return to order. This episode, then, shows how and why mathematical concepts and methods are anything but timeless or neutral; they define what “reason” is, and what it is not, and thus the concrete possibilities of political action. The technical and political are two sides of the same coin—and changes in notions like mathematical rigor, provability, and necessity simultaneously constitute changes in our political imagination.¤In 1806, the Kingdom of Naples was occupied by a French army and integrated into Napoleon’s imperial system. The French and their local supporters had a clear agenda: they wanted to transform the semifeudal society into a centralized administrative monarchy with a liberal economy. This ambitious plan, however, soon ran up against obdurate realities like muddy roads, brigandage, popular insurgencies, and the thinly disguised hostility of powerful local elites. There was another problem, too. Open a Neapolitan university textbook of the time and you will see that the French had to fight their battles in a land where their mathematics was wrong.While armed and cultural resistance against the French invaders’ imperial ambitions happened in other parts of Europe, the Neapolitan case is particularly interesting because it includes a mathematical resistance. This resistance took the form of a distinctive mathematical culture that was hegemonic in that kingdom for several decades—from the late 1790s to the 1830s. Contemporaries called it the Neapolitan synthetic school. The name referred to synthetic (or pure) geometry, a geometry that does not use coordinates and algebraic formulas to study figures and solve problems. Leading Neapolitan mathematicians embraced it as the veritable foundation of all mathematics. Only its methods and assumptions, they believed, could be trusted.What the Neapolitans most adamantly did not trust was what they called, not without irony, the “very modern mathematics.” This body of knowledge, associated mainly with France, was characterized by the rapid advancements of an algebraized form of infinitesimal calculus and by its stunning and far-reaching practical applications. It had severed its connections with Euclidean geometry, and was referred to as “analysis”—a term that, in this context, meant a vast array of algebraic methods and algorithmic procedures that could be used to represent how things change, whether those things were, say, the trajectory of a cannonball or agricultural productivity.Driven by eminently practical goals, analysis had become highly abstract: a versatile tool that could be applied to describe and control natural and social phenomena. The Neapolitans were quite sure it was morally suspect—a degenerate form of knowledge, and dangerous for the stability of society. Its proliferation across Europe and globally was, to them, an unmitigated disaster. While these allegations sound extravagant to our ears, some of their concerns resonate with ones in this century—e.g., about how even programmers who fashion certain complex algorithms do not understand their inner workings or why they come to the conclusions they do. Synthetics, for instance, pointed out that the analysts prioritized practical success over understanding: they aimed to model phenomena using algebraic tools that they could not fully justify, neither through some form of intellectual intuition nor through logic. By contrast, synthetic geometers clarified and grounded every single step of their procedures. They often used metaphors of sight to make this point: synthetic geometry allowed practitioners to see with clarity, and this is why their results could be trusted; analysts were blind when they manipulated their formulas. Using another set of metaphors: Analysts followed the fast flights of their feverish and uncontrolled imagination, while synthetics kept their feet on the ground. Their procedures were slow but safe.¤The mathematical 19th century was suffused with a distinctive foundational anxiety. We can see an early and radical manifestation of this anxiety in revolutionary Naples—in its bizarre and apparently backward attempt to return to a Greek-like pure geometry. The champion of this new old mathematics was Nicola Fergola (1753–1824), the charismatic and mystically inclined leader of a group of mathematicians and scientists who understood themselves as the last heirs of an ancient tradition, a tradition that was now under attack and needed to be defended.Skeptics, however, understood the synthetic school’s mathematical resistance as backwardness, the rearguard action of a group of isolated practitioners. And yet, Fergola’s puzzling quest for purity was something more. For one thing, there was no established tradition of synthetic geometry worth defending in Naples. The tradition Fergola invoked was largely an invention—an imaginary mathematical lineage that ran through ancient Greece, late antiquity, and Christian Europe, all the way down to these self-proclaimed final paladins. In fact, Fergola, who was well aware of recent mathematical developments, breathed new life into forgotten mathematical techniques. Neapolitan synthetic mathematics, in other words, was not a remnant of the past, but a new way of understanding mathematics, characterized by new canons of rigor and founded on a core of “pure” mathematics. In the name of a mythical tradition, it imposed a new discipline on its practitioners by emphasizing self-restraint as the key epistemic virtue. Fergola, his admirers reported, was a champion of self-control: he controlled his body, passions, and imagination, and knew well when to stop trusting his own mathematical techniques.¤The Neapolitans did not reject modern analysis simply because they considered it French. What triggered their anxiety were its technical features—the way it worked. Following the example of mathematicians like Condorcet, analysts were aiming to create a repertoire of finite and infinite algebraic methods that were abstract and general enough to apply to any kind of problem, be it in geometry, physics, economics, or even politics. This zealous quest for universal problem-solving algorithms is precisely what made the synthetics uneasy. Interestingly, the analysts themselves knew well that the manipulation of these algorithms—the way they produced results—was not grounded in either geometric intuition or logical arguments. What warranted their use, they believed, was that algebraic procedures mirrored the fundamental workings of the human mind. If, as the analysts believed, the mind was an analytic machine, then analysis was the quintessential expression of human reason—and, as such, isomorphic to nature: analysis was effective because it mirrored the deep structures of reality. This was a mathematics essentially interwoven with the world of experience—one that, as d’Alembert had written, “gives us the most perfect examples of the manner in which one should use the art of reasoning.”When asked to solve a geometric problem, the analysts would find an appropriate system of coordinates that would allow them to turn figures into algebraic formulas, then would manipulate these formulas to obtain the “solving equation,” as they called it. They would interpret the solutions as solutions to the original geometric problem. Their operations had thus shifted from geometry to algebra. Was this a legitimate move? The synthetics would say that it was legitimate only when they could see the geometry behind the formulas. But for complex problems this was not always possible, and in these instances algebra was blind; there was no way to reconstruct the geometrical meaning of the algebraic operations that led to the solution. It followed that the nature of the problem had changed. For the analysts, this was irrelevant: algebra captured the essential relations expressed by the terms of the problem, which then served to guide the mathematician toward the solution. For the synthetics, by contrast, a solution to the original geometrical problem could only be geometrical in nature; and so, what the analysts were offering were not solutions but meaningless numbers.While the analysts strove for maximum generality, the synthetics argued for the specificity and locality of all mathematical methods. They saw this as a question of jurisdiction: there are many different ways of reasoning and many different methods, and they all have their legitimate function and scope. It would be illusory—and deceitful—to try to solve a geometrical problem using purely algebraic methods, or a political problem using the methods of geometry. Even more misleading would be to believe that there is a single universal method that can be applied to all kinds of problems. The synthetics’ world was, so to speak, epistemologically stratified. They recognized many kinds of truth, and thought it essential to keep them separated from one another. The truth of the geometer, they claimed, has nothing to do with the truths of the theologian, historian, or politician.These two mathematical cultures differed sharply in the way they conceived mathematical reasoning. For the synthetics, mathematical knowledge was the product of a process of recognition, the imperfect representation of metaphysical states of affairs that the gifted mathematician would be able to glimpse. Their teaching reflected this view: a close-knit school with an inner circle of students who worked with their maestro, engaging in an endless reflection on geometrical problems received from antiquity. For the analysts, mathematical reasoning was just a particular case of analytic reasoning—calculus, especially, was where analytic reason could be best seen in action. They saw themselves as the standard bearers of modernization and the promoters of rational action across both scientific and social life. For them, mathematical training was a matter of learning to frame problems analytically and then solving them following a set of standard procedures. It was not a matter of intellectual intuition, gift, and genius. On the contrary, anyone, with proper training, could become an effective problem-solver.Analysts enthusiastically compared their method to the clunky workings of a machine: to them, the machine was an emblem of rational thinking. It was also a way of arguing for the algorithmic nature and therefore accessibility of the method, as its standardized procedures could be easily learned, and deployed across different contexts. At the core of their science was not the “pure and simple knowledge of truths,” they argued, but the knowledge of methods and their relative “strength” in getting useful results, including approximate ones, through the sheer power of calculation. The synthetics countered that results needed always to be precise and perfectly interpretable. The analysts were teaching their students blind methods that deformed their young minds; they were turning them into automata—soulless, machinelike number-crunchers—who ignored at their peril the meaning of the formulas they were manipulating. Well before the dawn of digital computing, the questions of the meaning of formal procedures and of the social implications of their extensive use were at the core of a debate that, using the language of morals, addressed basic questions of social order.¤Why did some mathematicians perceive logical gaps in analysis in the years around 1800, and why did they consider them unbearable? It turns out that anxieties about the foundations of analysis were growing even among its supporters. By the 1820s, these anxieties were spreading across Europe. Consider Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857), who played a key role in the creation of modern mathematics as we know it. His much-celebrated revolution had less to do with his specific contributions and more with his overall transformation of mathematics as a discipline.He brought order to the world of mathematics. He modernized it by imposing rigor. Mathematicians in the 18th century had achieved stunning results in algebra and infinitesimal calculus, but to Cauchy’s eyes, they had been too casual in how they defined their concepts and devised and applied their methods. This blithe attitude needed to end, he declared, and a new Euclidean spirit—a spirit of rigor—needed to replace it. Cauchy was not interested in bringing back synthetic geometry. Rather, he aimed to reinterpret analysis within a new logical framework in which every concept and procedure would be logically justified. Cauchy’s program of rigorization redefined the meaning of mathematical techniques, providing precise definitions and limits for the application of each method. He set boundaries, in other words, within which certain techniques could be legitimately deployed. The modern mathematicians were those who, following Cauchy, could discipline themselves through a new kind of technical precision.Cauchy’s rigorous analysis seems distant from Fergola’s Greek-like geometry. But it was shaped by the same foundational anxiety and urgency to restore order to a mathematical world that—in the views of both men—had gone badly astray. What we learn from the comparison is that the fundamental opposition was not between geometry and algebra but between mathematics as a pure, rigorous, self-contained, and reliable body of knowledge and mathematics as a set of highly general and universally applicable algorithmic procedures expressing an all-encompassing analytic rationality. The fact that Fergola tried literally to reinstate geometry at the core of mathematics while Cauchy injected a rigorous Euclidean spirit within analysis was more about their local conditions than anything else. What really mattered is that both programs promised a return to mathematical order.¤Fergola and his students were initially marginal to Neapolitan scientific life. Their geometrical program was perceived as outdated, while the world of the salons scoffed at their baroque religious devotion and ascetic lifestyle. But this changed dramatically after the storming of the Bastille, when they quickly acquired an unprecedented cultural relevance. The Neapolitan government would take a decisive anti-French stance, reorient its entire cultural politics accordingly, and align itself with the Catholic Church. Within the Church itself, enlightened reformism gave way to a Jesuitic religiosity that reactivated baroque devotions and mobilized popular piety to support the alliance of throne and altar.In 1794, the discovery of a Jacobin conspiracy to overthrow the monarchy sent the court into a state of panic. The Jacobins would succeed five years later, in 1799, when Naples became a republic. The leading revolutionaries were mathematicians. The chief conspirator of 1794, and the first president of the republic, Carlo Lauberg (1752–1834), was a teacher of chemistry and mathematics. It is no accident that almost every noteworthy figure in Neapolitan Jacobinism received some mathematical training: a basic understanding of analysis was an essential part of their worldview, as were republicanism, egalitarianism, and anticlericalism. The very structure of their secret society—a network of Jacobin clubs—was a working model of how analysis could be deployed in matters of social organization.Neapolitan Jacobins aimed to find universal methods to address pressing social and political problems—above all, the problems of political representation and wealth redistribution. By the mid-1790s, they had become convinced that their vision of a just and equal society could be realized only through the universal implementation of analysis, which they understood as a revolutionary mathematics. Analysis was already being applied to the natural sciences and now, they said, it was time to apply it to the science of society as well, and to political matters. The analytic method would turn the art of politics into a science, replacing tradition, prejudice, and private interests with rational decision-making. To apply analysis to politics meant to reduce it to its elementary components, study their relations, and use algebraic procedures to intervene. This would detach politics from its metaphysical assumptions, turning it into a matter of rational and transparent administration. The analytic revolution could now be expected to transform society by making it possible to operationalize “the will of the people.”Neapolitan Jacobins thus took the tools and basic assumptions of analysis and turned them into a militant mathematics—the veritable “backbone of society.” A programmatically impure mathematics, it was a universal language and reasoning style that could be applied across disciplinary boundaries to bring about immediate social change. In fact, mathematics and politics merged seamlessly in the lived experience of these Jacobins, who saw themselves as agents of change, able to escape the logic of reform and the apparent fatalities of history.The counterrevolutionaries reacted by turning these analytic features into the “Jacobin machine,” a deadly device for the control of public opinion, political life, and the state. The metaphor emphasized discipline, organization, and the capacity for control, but also gestured toward the extraneous and polluting character of what was described as a set of manipulation techniques. In Naples, the Jacobin machine was viewed as foreign, disconnected from local political traditions. But in France too, its effect was seen as one of contamination, this time from the inside. In both cases, the purity of the body politic had to be defended from a malignant mechanical-analytic threat.The breathtaking adventure of the Jacobin Republic, characterized by sweeping plans for popular education and redistribution of wealth, ended abruptly five months after it started, in June 1799, when British, Russian, and Turkish forces joined a local counterrevolutionary army and stormed the walls of Naples. In its aftermath, about 120 prominent Jacobins were put on show trials and executed. Fergola had moved to the countryside during these months. A biographer reported that he could not stand “the noise” of the city. When he returned, he and his students were asked to reorganize scientific life in the university and in the entire system of public education. Education, which had been “infected” by the Jacobins, a royal dispatch read, now needed to be brought back to its ancient order.Fergola, a celibate vegetarian who found the presence of women extremely unpleasant, was a tormented man. He was not someone who could easily fit into the salons of Enlightenment Naples. His religiosity was deliberately untimely and baroque. He chose the most anti-modern and anti-rationalist religiosity, the popular piety of the Neapolitan crowds, when this religiosity was under attack. A spate of crying and bleeding Madonnas signaled the crisis of a subaltern agrarian world that would soon explode in massive counterrevolutionary insurgencies. Embracing popular religion in the 1790s meant embracing it as resistance. In general terms, it was a resistance against the modern state’s secularized and rational principles of organization. In this sense, Fergola’s public display of his rosary and bloodied scourge was a politicized act of resistance. And in this sense, his mathematics, too, was a politicized act of resistance.Fergola suffered numerous and often inexplicable “organic” and “moral” ailments that progressively hampered his activity. Yet, we are told, he gazed serenely at his sore body as if that flesh was not his own: his entire life could be recounted as a triumph of spirit over matter. Exhausted by mysterious convulsions and prostrated by horrific demonic visions, Fergola felt that his faith was constantly put to the test. But even as his own health failed, his school prospered. To the end, he railed about the degeneration of learning and the “sacrilegious horde,” which included Freemasons, Jacobins, liberals, and even some of his legitimist colleagues.¤With the French occupation of 1806, the synthetic school had to face, once again, the threat of analysis. The world, however, had changed. Most surviving Jacobins had come to terms with the Napoleonic normalization. The synthetics controlled the university, but outside of it, analysis thrived, constituting the core training in the new schools of engineering fostered by the French. The continuity, however, was mostly apparent. Many former revolutionaries, in France as in Naples, had turned the question of modernization into a technical problem, and had refashioned their personas and social function in terms of scientific neutrality and technocratic efficiency. Historian Ken Alder has aptly labeled them “techno-Jacobins.” In this normalized context, mathematics was a neutral tool, the distinctive expertise of technical elites who served the state. The direct connection between mathematics, egalitarianism, and republicanism, built through the notion of a universal analytic reason, had been severed, and with it vanished the very possibility of a revolutionary mathematics. But reframing modernization as a technical rather than a political problem meant detaching analysis’s formal tools from their original source of legitimation. Intriguingly, the political choice of reframing modernization in exclusively technical terms had produced a profound and pervasive mathematical problem.Led by Fergola’s students, the synthetic school fought against the technical elites of the modern state, mostly civil engineers and statisticians, for scientific hegemony. The old regime had long been imploding in Naples, but a new order struggled to consolidate itself. The French had arrived in Naples with a promise of order through modernization, and had found receptive interlocutors in the landed elites who could most benefit from the abolition of the feudal-communal system. The new technical experts had been charged with changing the kingdom’s physical and social landscape accordingly. Technical disciplines such as statistics or topography became key sites for negotiation, collaboration, and conflict between landed elites and the central government. On this technical terrain, the new experts would continuously clash with the synthetics.It is not a coincidence that the synthetic school faded into oblivion when the reactionary position lost ground as a viable political option. From the 1820s onward, what was really at stake was the form of the new relations between the centralized administrative state, the landed elites, and the largely dispossessed peasant masses. Analysis had morphed into a set of allegedly neutral administrative tools, and the controversy between analytics and synthetics, which had long defined Neapolitan academic life, became increasingly meaningless. The technicians who supported the state’s modernizing action now argued for a mathematical reconciliation. What the two groups were defending, it was now believed, were simply two different ways of looking at mathematics, which should not be seen as opposed to each other but rather as complementary. The synthetics approach was useful for didactic purposes, while the analytic one was best suited for research and the discovery of new mathematical truths. This compromise was an elegant way of disposing of what, at that point, was an embarrassing anomaly for Neapolitan science. This normalized reconstruction eliminated revolutionary and reactionary scientific aberrations, emphasized continuity in the history of mathematics, and aligned with the political life of Restoration-age Naples, which was hegemonized by new landed elites and their liberal and constitutional ambitions. Emblematic of this cultural climate was the success of philosophical positions grounded on consciousness, which insisted that, within certain limits, individual reason was autonomous and legislative, and that fighting for liberty of conscience coincided with fighting for political and economic liberty.The mathematical controversy between synthetics and analytics had been a controversy about the nature of reason all along. At stake was reason’s nature and limits. The Jacobin’s analytic reason was universal, active, calculative, individual, a priori, and ahistorical; it was a completely autonomous reason that, when not obstructed, could truthfully describe and legitimately change the world—through revolutionary action, if necessary. The reason of the synthetic, by contrast, was local, passive, intuitive, collective, a posteriori, and eminently suited to historical thinking; it was a dependent reason, whose outcomes needed to be warranted by external sources of legitimation like tradition, custom, experience, religion, and metaphysical principles. It was, as such, a reactionary reason that envisioned the return to order as a return to hierarchy—order produced by subordination. This reactionary reason was a militant reason, its arguments forged in battle.It is only by contrast to an abhorred revolutionary reason, political theorist Corey Robin reminds us, that the invocation of ancient forms of wisdom can captivate the modern mind. The image of reason that emerged with the consolidation of the modern liberal state valued individual reason while acknowledging its clear limits. The principles of a liberal economy and the new relationships of subordination between landed elites and peasant masses were not to be questioned. The autonomy of individual reason was celebrated against prerevolutionary obscurantism and absolutism, but it was only a relative autonomy, to be exercised within the boundaries of postfeudal order. The newly rigorous mathematics and the constitutional project set those boundaries with precision. If absolutism was a thing of the past, so should be revolutionary anarchy.¤Logical inference, Wittgenstein quipped, is how we refer to what we do not intend to question. The case of the Neapolitan mathematical resistance should not be seen as one in which mathematics was temporarily distorted by politics. When we craft logico-mathematical concepts and techniques, we design ways of ordering the natural and social world. These ways of ordering the world open up certain possibilities for action—including political action—while closing down others. They discriminate between what is visible, plausible, and logical, and what is none of those things. Jacobin mathematics was deployed to critique and radically transform the existing social order, empowering traditionally subordinate social groups and bringing them into the space of politics as legitimate autonomous agents. The mathematics of the synthetics was designed to deny this possibility, to turn it, in fact, into a logical impossibility—hence it was, strictly speaking, a reactionary mathematics.Modern mathematics, as it took shape with Cauchy and those who continued his program, was constitutive of the postrevolutionary political normalization. It was the logico-mathematical infrastructure of the new moderate liberal discourse. It retained analysis’s operative orientation while embracing the synthetics’ quest for a foundational core of mathematical knowledge. The image of reason it embodied was bounded and self-disciplined, and while it legitimated a neutral, instrumental technical dimension, it confined the truth of mathematics to the ethereal and otherworldly realm of pure mathematics. Fergola’s mathematics, it turns out, was modern.¤Massimo Mazzotti is a professor at UC Berkeley, where he holds the Thomas M. Siebel Presidential Chair in the History of Science.

(The company was incubated as part of Alphabet’s “moonshot factory” X.)\nThe FT reports that Waymo is bringing on new investors Dragoneer, Sequoia Capital, and DST Global, with existing backers Andreessen Horowitz and Abu Dhabi sovereign fund Mubadala also participating in the round.\nWhen contacted by TechCrunch, a company spokesperson said in a statement, “While we don’t comment on private financial matters, our trajectory is clear: with over 20 million trips completed, we are focused on the safety-led operational excellence and technological leadership required to meet the vast demand for autonomous mobility.”\nThe company is expanding quickly, including with a recent launch in Miami. That growth has come with some challenges, including a number of robotaxis that stalled at traffic lights during a widespread San Francisco blackout.\nWaymo has more than $350 million in annual recurring revenue, according to the FT. The company last raised a $5.6 billion Series C in 2024, valuing the company at $45 billion.\nTopics\nAlphabet, dragoneer, DST Global, Sequoia Capital, Transportation, Waymo\nOctober 13-15\nSan Francisco, CA\nTickets are live at the lowest rates of the year.

The FCC recently gave SpaceX permission to launch an additional 7,500 Starlink satellites, but said it would “defer authorization on the remaining 14,988” proposed satellites.\nThere are currently arond man-made 15,000 satellites orbiting the Earth, according to the European Space Agency, and they’re already creating issues with pollution and debris.\nThe filing also comes as Amazon — citing a lack of rockets — is seeking an extension on an FCC deadline to have more than 1,600 satellites in orbit.

The two companies announced a plan in September in which Nvidia would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI and also build 10 gigawatts of computing infrastructure for the AI company.\nHowever, the WSJ said Huang has begun emphasizing that the deal is nonbinding, and that he’s also privately criticized OpenAI’s business strategy and expressed concerns about competitors like Anthropic and Google.\nIn addition, the WSJ reported that the two companies are rethinking their relationship — though that doesn’t mean cutting things off entirely, with recent discussions reportedly focusing on an equity investment of a mere tens of billions of dollars from Nvidia.\nAn OpenAI spokesperson told the WSJ that the companies are “actively working through the details of our partnership,” adding that Nvidia “has underpinned our breakthroughs from the start, powers our systems today, and will remain central as we scale what comes next.”\nAccording to Bloomberg, reporters asked Huang about the report during a visit to Taipei. In response, he insisted that Nvidia will “definitely participate” in OpenAI’s latest funding round “because it’s such a good investment.”\n“We will invest a great deal of money,” Huang said. “I believe in OpenAI.

So Tobaccowala turned to something she knew well: surveys.\n“Given my love of surveys, I surveyed a ton — a ton — of customers,” said Tobaccowala, who used to be president and CTO of SurveyMonkey.\nWhat she found was that people were struggling to figure out how to lower their utility bills.\n“When we talked to consumers, we heard the same thing over and over again: They get that email that says, ‘Hey, you spend more money than your neighbors,’” she said. “They were sort of stuck with what to do about it.”\nTobaccowala co-founded HomeBoost to help people conduct their own home energy assessments. The company was part of the Startup Battlefield 200 at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.\nTechcrunch event\nTechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live\nOn June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

As people walk around their homes, the infrared camera shows them where cold (or hot) air is seeping into their homes; the blacklight tells people which lights could be upgraded.\nUsing data from the scans, the app then automatically generates a report which suggests the most cost effective upgrades, including rebates based on where the person lives.\nIn many parts of the country, utilities offer a similar service. Utilities, which are incentivized to reduce end users’ energy use, often work with energy auditors to survey people’s homes to identify ways to trim their consumption. But the quality of those services can be very uneven, Tobaccowala said.\n“We talked to a bunch of consumers who’d gotten home energy assessments done, and there this feeling that was like ‘all they did was try to sell me up an upgraded HVAC,’” she said.\nThe HomeBoost app is cheaper and faster than an auditor, and it helps people feel more in control of the process, Tobaccowala said.\nHomeBoost charges customers $99, which is about a quarter the cost of a traditional, in-person assessment. It is also working with utilities, which cover some or all of the cost for customers. The startup has signed deals with Central Hudson, Omaha Public Power District, and more recently Avista. Omaha Power, for example, pays for all but $19 of the cost, while Central Hudson will cover the entire cost if homeowners check out the BoostBox from a public library.\nBut not every homeowner wants to complete the survey process themselves, and not every auditor is a pushy salesperson. Dedicated auditors can spend between two and 10 hours surveying homes, collating data, and building reports, Tobaccowala said. For that, HomeBoost has developed a version of its app for professionals, allowing them to serve more customers.\nThe company is also testing a feature that will link homeowners with contractors who can follow through on the upgrades outlined in the report. For contractors, it’s another source of new business, and it allows them to get information on a project before even setting foot inside a home.\nBy bringing consumers, utilities, and contractors together, Tobaccowalla hopes that HomeBoost can ultimately deliver on the climate front, too. “It’s a very unique situation where everybody’s aligned to actually lower the utility bill, which in the net result is improvement on the climate,” she said.\nTopics\nClimate, energy efficiency, Exclusive, homeboost, Real estate, Startup Battlefield 200, Startups, TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, utilities\nTim De Chant\nSenior Reporter, Climate\nTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

So every month, we highlight a handful of the best stories that nearly slipped through the cracks. January’s list includes a lip-syncing robot; using brewer’s yeast as scaffolding for lab-grown meat;  hunting for Leonardo da Vinci’s DNA in his art; and new evidence that humans really did transport the stones to build Stonehenge from Wales and northern Scotland, rather than being transported by glaciers.\nHumans, not glaciers, moved stones to Stonehenge\nCredit:\nTimothy Darvill\nCredit:\nTimothy Darvill\nStonehenge is an iconic landmark of endless fascination to tourists and researchers alike. There has been a lot of recent chemical analysis identifying where all the stones that make up the structure came from, revealing that many originated in quarries a significant distance away. So how were the stones transported to their current location?\nOne theory holds that glaciers moved the bluestones at least part of the way from Wales to Salisbury Plain in southern England, while others contend that humans moved them—although precisely how that was done has yet to be conclusively determined. Researchers at Curtin University have now produced the strongest scientific evidence to date that it was humans, not glaciers, that transported the stones, according to a paper published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.\nCurtin’s Anthony Clarke and co-authors relied on mineral fingerprinting to arrive at their conclusions. In 2024, Clarke’s team discovered the Stonehenge Altar Stone originated from the Orkney region in the very northeast corner of Scotland, rather than Wales. This time, they analyzed hundreds of zircon crystals collected from rivers close to the historic monument, looking for evidence of Pleistocene-era sediment. Per Clarke, if the stones had “sailed” to the plain from further north, there would be a distinct mineral signature in that sediment as the transported rocks eroded over time. They didn’t find that signature, making it far more likely that humans transported the stone.\nDOI: Communications Earth & Environment, 2026. 10.1038/s43247-025-03105-3  (About DOIs).\nWhen grasshoppers fly\nCredit:\nPrinceton University/Sameer A. Khan/Fotobuddy\nCredit:\nPrinceton University/Sameer A. Khan/Fotobuddy\nEveryone knows grasshoppers can hop, but they can also flap their wings, jump, and glide, moving seamlessly across both the ground and through the air. That ability inspired scientists from Princeton University to devise a novel approach to building robotic wings, according to a paper published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. This could one day enable multimodal locomotion for miniature robots with extended flight times.\nAccording to the authors, grasshoppers have two sets of wings: forewings and hindwings. Forewings are mostly used for protection and camouflage, while the latter are involved in flapping and gliding, and are corrugated to allow them to fold into the insect’s body. The team took CT scans to capture the geometry of grasshopper wings and used the scans to 3D print model wings with varying designs. Next they tested each variant in a water channel to study how water flowed around the wing, isolating key features like a wing’s shape or corrugation to see how this impacted the flow.\nOnce they had perfected their design, they printed new wings and attached them to small frames to create grasshopper-sized gliders. The team then launched the gliders across the lab and used motion capture to evaluate how well they flew. The glider performed as well as actual grasshoppers. In addition, they found that a smooth wing resulted in more efficient gliding. So why do real grasshopper wings have corrugations? The authors suggest that these evolved because they help with executing steep angles.\nDOI: Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 2026. 10.1098/rsif.2025.0117  (About DOIs).\nLip-syncing robot\nCredit: Yuhang Hu/Creative Machines Lab\nCredit: Yuhang Hu/Creative Machines Lab\nHumanoid robots are fascinating, but nobody would mistake them for actual humans, in part because even the ones that have faces are far too limited in facial gestures, including lip motion—hence, the “Uncanny Valley.” Columbia University engineers have now created a robot capable of learning facial lip motions for speaking and singing. According to a paper published in Science Robotics, the resulting robotic face was able to speak words in several different languages and sing an AI-generated song. (Its AI-generated debut album is aptly titled hello world.).\nWhat makes human faces so uniquely capable of expression are the dozens of muscles lying just under the skin. Robotic faces are rigid and hence only have a limited range of motion. The Columbia team built their robotic face out of flexible material augmented with 26 motors (actuators). The robot learned to how its face moved in response to different actuator activity by watching itself in a mirror as it attempted thousands of random facial expressions. Eventually it learned how to achieve specific facial gestures.\nThe next step was to let the robot watch recorded videos of humans talking and singing, augmented with an AI algorithm that enabled it to learn exactly how the human mouths moved when performing those tasks so it could lip sync along. The resulting lip motion wasn’t perfect;  the robot struggled with “B” and “W” sounds in particular. But the authors believe the robot will improve with more practice; combining this ability with ChatGPT or Gemini could further improve its lip-syncing ability.\nDOI: Science Robotics, 2026. 10.1126/scirobotics.adx3017  (About DOIs).\nIs Leonardo’s DNA preserved in his art?\nCredit:\nPaola Agazzi / Archivio di Stato di Prato / Italian Ministry of Culture\nCredit:\nPaola Agazzi / Archivio di Stato di Prato / Italian Ministry of Culture\nIn 2020, scientists analyzed the microbes found on several of Leonardo da Vinci’s drawings and discovered that each had its own distinct microbiome/. A second team, working with the Leonardo da Vinci DNA Project in France, collected and analyzed swabs taken from centuries-old art in a private collection housed in Florence, Italy. They concluded that microbial signatures could be used to differentiate artwork according to the materials used—dubbing this emerging subfield “arteomics.”\nYet another team collaborating with the project painstakingly assembled Leonardo’s family tree in 2021, spanning 21 generations from 1331 to the present, resulting a full-length book published last year. The idea was that this will one day provide a means of conducting DNA testing to confirm whether the bones interred in Leonardo’s grave are actually the his. And now the project’s scientists are back with a preprint posted to the bioRxiv, announcing the successful sequencing of human DNA collected from a handful of artifacts associated with Leonardo—including a drawing of the Holy Child that some scholars attribute to Leonardo, as well as letters from a da Vinci family member.\nThe team lightly swabbed samples from the artifacts’ surfaces and were able to recover human Y-chromosome sequences from several of the samples. Several of these sequences were related and the authors speculate that some might even be Leonardo’s, although they cautioned that the samples would need to be compared to samples taken from the artist’s notebooks, burial site, and family tomb to make a definitive identification. The authors also found DNA from bacteria, fungi, flowers, and animals in some of the samples, as well as traces of viruses and parasites.\nDOI: bioRxiv, 2026. 10.64898/2026.01.06.697880  (About DOIs).\nFrom pint to plate\nCredit:\nChristian Harrison et al., 2026\nCredit:\nChristian Harrison et al., 2026\nLab-grown meat is often touted as a more environmentally responsible alternative to the real deal, but carnivorous consumers are often put off by the unappealing mouthfeel and texture (and, for me, a weird oily aftertaste). A new method using spent brewer’s yeast to make edible “scaffolding” for cultivating meat in the lab might one day offer a solution, according to a paper published in the journal Frontiers in  Nutrition.\nTypically, a nutrient broth is used as a source of bacteria for the scaffolding. But Richard Day of University College London and his co-authors decided to use brewer’s yeast, usually discarded as waste, to culture a species of bacteria known for making high-quality cellulose. Then they tested the mechanical and structural properties of that cellulose with a “chewing machine.” They concluded that the cellulose made from spent brewer’s yeast was much closer in texture to real meat than the cellulose scaffolding made from a nutrient broth. The next step is to incorporate fat and muscle cells into the cellulose, as well as testing yeast from different kinds of beer.\nDOI: Frontiers in Nutrition, 2026. 10.3389/fnut.2025.1656960  (About DOIs).\nWater-driven gears\nNew York University scientists created a gear mechanism that relies on water to generate movement. For some conditions, the rotors spin in the same direction like pulleys looped together with a belt.\nGears have been around for thousands of years; the Chinese were using them in two-wheeled chariots as far back as 3000 BCE, and they are a mainstay in windmills, clocks, and the famed Antikythera mechanism. Roboticists also use gears in their inventions, but whether they are made of wood, metal or plastic, such gears tend to be inflexible and hence more prone to breakage. That’s why New York University mathematician Leif Reistroph and colleagues decided to see if flowing air or water could be used to rotate robotic structures.\nRistroph’s lab frequently addresses all manner of colorful real-world puzzles: fine-tuning the recipe for the perfect bubble, for instance; exploring the physics of the Hula-Hoop; or the formation processes underlying so-called “stone forests” common in China and Madagascar. In 2021, his lab built a working Tesla valve, in accordance with the inventor’s design; the following year they studied the complex aerodynamics of what makes a good paper airplane—specifically what is needed for smooth gliding; and in 2024 they cracked the conundrum of the “reverse sprinkler” problem that physicists like Richard Feynman, among others, had grappled with since the 1940s.\nFor their latest paper, published in the journal Physical Review Letters, Ristroph et al. wanted to devise something that functioned like a gear only with flowing liquid driving the motion, instead of teeth grinding against each other. They conducted a series of experiments in which they immersed cylindrical rotors in a glycerol-and-water solution. One cylinder would rotate while the other was passive.\nThey found that the rotating cylinder, combined with fluid flow, was sufficient to induce rotation in the passive cylinder. The flows functioned much in the same way as gear teeth when the cylinders were close together. Moving the cylinders further apart caused the active cylinder to rotate faster, looping the flows around the passive cylinder—essentially mimicking a belt and pulley system.\nDOI: Physical Review Letters, 2026. 10.1103/m6ft-ll2c  (About DOIs).\nJennifer Ouellette\nSenior Writer\nJennifer Ouellette\nSenior Writer\nJennifer is a senior writer at Ars Technica with a particular focus on where science meets culture, covering everything from physics and related interdisciplinary topics to her favorite films and TV series.

Typically using psilocybin mushrooms or LSD, the archetypal microdoser sought less melting walls and open-eye kaleidoscopic visuals than boosts in mood and energy, like a gentle spring breeze blowing through the mind.\nAnecdotal reports pitched microdosing as a kind of psychedelic Swiss Army knife, providing everything from increased focus to a spiked libido and (perhaps most promisingly) lowered reported levels of depression. It was a miracle for many. Others remained wary. Could 5 percent of a dose of acid really do all that? A new, wide-ranging study by an Australian biopharma company suggests that microdosing’s benefits may indeed be drastically overstated—at least when it comes to addressing symptoms of clinical depression.\nA Phase 2B trial of 89 adult patients conducted by Melbourne-based MindBio Therapeutics, investigating the effects of microdosing LSD in the treatment of major depressive disorder, found that the psychedelic was actually outperformed by a placebo. Across an eight-week period, symptoms were gauged using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a widely recognized tool for the clinical evaluation of depression.\nThe study has not yet been published. But MindBio’s CEO Justin Hanka recently released the top-line results on his LinkedIn, eager to show that his company was “in front of the curve in microdosing research.” He called it “the most vigorous placebo controlled trial ever performed in microdosing.” It found that patients dosed with a small amount of LSD (ranging from 4 to 20μg, or micrograms, well below the threshold of a mind-blowing hallucinogenic dose) showed observable upticks in feelings of well-being, but worse MADRS scores, compared to patients given a placebo in the form of a caffeine pill. (Because patients in psychedelic trials typically expect some kind of mind-altering effect, studies are often blinded using so-called “active placebos,” like caffeine or methylphenidate, which have their own observable psychoactive properties.)\nThis means, essentially, that a medium-strength cup of coffee may prove more beneficial in treating major depressive disorder than a tiny dose of acid. Good news for habitual caffeine users, perhaps, but less so for researchers (and biopharma startups) counting on the efficacy of psychedelic microdosing.\n“It’s probably a nail in the coffin of using microdosing to treat clinical depression,” Hanka says. “It probably improves the way depressed people feel—just not enough to be clinically significant or statistically meaningful.”\nHowever despairing, these results conform with the suspicions of some more skeptical researchers, who have long believed that the benefits of microdosing are less the result of a teeny-tiny psychedelic catalyst, and more attributable to the so-called “placebo effect.”\nIn 2020, Jay A. Olson, then a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, conducted an experiment. He gave 33 participants a placebo, telling them it was actually a dose of a psilocybin-like drug. They were led to believe there was no placebo group. Other researchers who were in on the bit acted out the effects of the drug, in a room treated with trippy lighting and other visual stimulants, in an attempt to curate the “optimized expectation” of a psychedelic experience.\nThe resulting paper, titled “Tripping on Nothing,” found that a majority of participants had reported feeling the effects of the drug—despite there being no real drug whatsoever. “The main conclusion we had is that the placebo effect can be stronger than expected in psychedelic studies,” Olson, now a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto, tells WIRED. “Placebo effects were stronger than what you would get from microdosing.”\nMore than a stick in the eye to the microdosing faithful, Olson maintains that the study’s key findings had more to do with the actual role, and power, of the placebo effect. “The public has a lot of misconceptions about the placebo effect,” he says. “There’s this assumption that placebo effects are extremely weak, or that they’re not real.”\nOlson goes on to say that placebo effects in psychedelic trials can be further juiced by the hype around the drugs themselves. Patients may enter a trial expecting a certain experience, and their mind is able to conjure a version of that experience, in turn. In Olson’s study, it wasn’t a matter of microdosing effects not being real, but that those effects may be caused by environment, or patient expectation. As he puts it: “It can be true at the same time that microdosing can have positive effects on people, and that those effects are perhaps almost entirely placebo.”\nThis itself raises a sticky question about MindBio’s study. How could a placebo group, who thinks they’re taking LSD, perform better than an active control group, members of which both think they’re taking LSD and are actually taking it? The answer comes from the design of the study itself.\nUsing what’s called a “double-dummy” design, MindBio’s researchers informed patients that they’d either be receiving LSD, a caffeine pill, or a dose of methylphenidate, better known as Ritalin or Concerta. (No patients were actually administered the methylphenidate.) This means that patient expectation was lowered, as they could ascribe any perceived effects to either the LSD or either of the active placebos. Patients taking LSD microdoses may well have believed they were merely on a stimulant. All patients followed an adaptation of the “Fadiman protocol,” a popular microdosing programme that sees patients taking a small dose of the given drug once every three days.\nJim Fadiman, the veteran psychedelic researcher after whom the protocol is named, rejects MindBio’s conclusions, and trial design, out of hand. Because, Fadiman believes, patients were given the active caffeine placebo, their reported benefits may well be attributable not to a pure placebo effect, but to the actual psychoactive properties of that drug.\n“Double-dummy is a remarkably apt term,” Fadiman, 86, sneers. “What I know is that if you take enough caffeine, you will not be depressed!”\nFadiman points to MindBio’s earlier, Phase 2A study, recently published in the journal Neuropharmacology, which drew markedly different conclusions. It was a non-blinded, so-called “open label” study, meaning patients knew definitely that they were being microdosed with LSD. This study found that MADRS scores decreased by 59.5 percent, with effects lasting as long as six months. It also found improvements in stress, rumination, anxiety, and patient quality of life. Fadiman says that this reportage is more consistent with his own research on microdosing. “Their prior study did wonderfully with LSD,” Fadiman says. “I have collected literally hundreds of real world reports over the years that validate those findings.”\nMindBio’s Hanka stands by the science. “We are bewildered at the significant difference between the open label Phase 2A trial results and the Phase 2B trial results,” he says. “But that is the nature of good science—a properly controlled trial will get a proper result. Our Phase 2B trial was of the highest standard, a triple-blind, double-dummy, active placebo controlled trial. I haven’t seen another psychedelic trial that has gone to these lengths to control and blind a trial.”\nDespite these findings, some microdosing true believers don’t seem especially shaken. In 2017, writer Ayelet Waldman (best known as the author of the Mommy-Track Mysteries series of novels that follow the adventures of stay-at-home-mom-cum-sleuth Juliet Applebaum) published A Really Good Day, a diaristic account of her own self-experiments using microdosing to treat an intractable mood disorder. She tells WIRED she’s not especially bothered by the implication that her positive shifts in mood may have merely been placebo. “In my book I took very seriously the possibility that what I was experiencing was the mother of all placebo effects,” Waldman says. “I wrote about this a number of times in various chapters and decided in the end it didn’t matter. What mattered was that I felt better.”\nPerhaps that’s true enough. If the effects are measurable, and repeatable, then it should hardly matter if they’re attributable to a sub-perceptual dose of lysergic acid, or to the (perhaps equally profound) mysteries of the placebo. Still, one cannot help but wonder why anyone looking to use LSD to aid severe clinical depression would bother assuming the legal risk of procuring and consuming a drug still classified under Schedule I by the US Drug Enforcement Administration.\nCertainly, for his part, Justin Hanka seems content to pivot MindBio’s research into a new field. His next project is “Booze A.I.”: a smartphone app that uses artificial intelligence to scan the human voice for relevant biomarkers that determine blood alcohol concentration. He’s leaving microdosing in the rearview. “I put millions of dollars into this myself,” he says. “Had I known six years ago what I know about psychedelics, I probably wouldn’t have ventured into the microdosing field.”\nThis story originally appeared on wired.com.\nWIRED\nWIRED\nWired.com is your essential daily guide to what's next, delivering the most original and complete take you'll find anywhere on innovation's impact on technology, science, business and culture.\n95 Comments",

All of them were carrying signs and wearing whistles around their necks on top of layers and layers of winter clothing. At first there were dozens of us walking toward Government Plaza, across the street from Minneapolis City Hall, and within a block it was hundreds. By the time I arrived it was thousands. Some reports said five to ten thousand, but on the ground, it felt like a single vibrating mass that was too large to count.I made my way through the throng, repeating “excuse me” and “pardon me” despite the din because the people here are above all else unfailingly polite. Someone offered me a “Fuck ICE“ pin. Someone else offered me a chocolate-chip cookie. Another offered me a red vuvuzela. All three declined to be named or interviewed.Friday, January 30 was the second general strike in the Twin Cities since federal immigration officers killed Alex Pretti. This one was reportedly organized by Somali and Black student groups at the University of Minnesota. Unlike the first strike, held last week and endorsed by local unions, this Friday’s was more hastily organized than the first economic blackout. I heard murmurs of lower turnout this time around, which was difficult to square with the fact that the plaza was so crowded that I didn’t understand how more people could possibly fit. And yet Minnesotans kept coming. The light-rail car pulled in and through the windows I saw the people inside were standing shoulder to shoulder, and they poured out and somehow filled space that wasn’t there.They chanted: “No more Minnesota nice, Minneapolis will strike.”Unlike the ongoing protests outside the Whipple Federal Building, the staging area from which ICE agents depart in unmarked cars to hunt down immigrants, the mood at the City Hall rally was almost jubilant, despite the under-current of outrage and terror that is present everywhere here. At Whipple, people jeer and yell at federal agents and local sheriff’s deputies alike, and their taunts are often met with flash bangs and pepper spray. Today, there appeared to be no such danger at the City Hall rally, but if the people of Minneapolis have learned anything over the past few weeks, it’s that danger lurks around every corner. You can be sitting in your car and be killed by a federal agent. You can be doing ICE watch and be killed by a federal agent. You can be protesting that killing and be arrested by federal agents. You can be walking or driving to work and be snatched by a federal agent. You can blow a whistle to alert your neighbors that federal agents are snatching someone off the street, and you’ll end up, at the very least, pepper sprayed by a federal agent. Medics milled about, prepared for the worst.Memorial for Alex PrettiHelicopters circled overhead. Volunteer marshals in neon vests, stationed at nearly every entrance and street corner, directed the crowd. One warned me about the ice; I didn’t hear her and slipped, but a woman behind me caught my fall.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Gaby Del ValleCloseGaby Del VallePolicy ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All by Gaby Del VallePolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All PolicyMore in: ICE invades Minnesota and Minnesotans fight backDon Lemon has been arrested for covering an anti-ICE protestTina NguyenJan 30Parenting in ICE-occupied MinneapolisScott MeslowJan 30I grew up with Alex PrettiKristen RadtkeJan 27Most PopularMost PopularTesla throws in the towel on car salesThere’s a social network for AI agents, and it’s getting weirdVideo game company stock prices dip after Google introduces an AI world-generation toolJeffrey Epstein was permanently banned from Xbox LiveThe latest Instax printer is a pricey but worthy upgradeThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.SpaceX filed a request with the FCC on Friday seeking approval to put a constellation of 1 million data center satellites into orbit. While the FCC is unlikely to approve a network that expansive, SpaceX’s strategy has been to request approval for unrealistically large numbers of satellites as a starting point for negotiations.The filing proposes establishing a network of solar-powered data centers in low Earth orbit that communicate with one another via lasers. The filling speaks of the constellation in ambitious sci-fi terms, calling it a “first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilization — one that can harness the Sun’s full power.”Even if just a small fraction of those 1 million satellites wind up in orbit, it would mark a significant increase in the number of man-made objects in space. The European Space Agency estimates there are around 15,000 satellites orbiting the Earth at the moment, and the majority are Starlink. (Over 9,600 of them, according to Johnathan’s Space Report.)When experts are already concerned about the abundance of space junk and potential for orbital collisions, such an explosion of objects in orbit would seem ill-advised. But SpaceX argues that the orbital data centers would be a cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternative to land-based centers that form the backbone of the growing AI industry. Instead of syphoning water from communities, polluting groundwater, and driving up electricity bills, orbital data centers would be able to radiate heat into the vacuum of space and rely almost exclusively on real-time solar power and limited batteries.The backlash against data centers has been growing, and communities are increasingly winning their battles to block their construction. So it’s no surprise that the biggest names in AI are turning their attention to one of the few places where there isn’t a community to upset.Correction January 31st: An earlier version of this article stated that there were over 11,000 Starlink satellites in orbit. That number was the total launched, including satellites that had been decommissioned. This has been corrected to reflect how many Starlink satellites are currently active in orbit.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Terrence O'BrienCloseTerrence O'BrienWeekend EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All by Terrence O'BrienAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All AIElon MuskCloseElon MuskPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All Elon MuskNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All NewsScienceCloseSciencePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All ScienceSpaceCloseSpacePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All SpaceSpaceXCloseSpaceXPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All SpaceXTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularTesla throws in the towel on car salesThere’s a social network for AI agents, and it’s getting weirdVideo game company stock prices dip after Google introduces an AI world-generation toolJeffrey Epstein was permanently banned from Xbox LiveThe latest Instax printer is a pricey but worthy upgradeThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Some of our favorite deals of the holiday season have returned in some fashion, making now a great time to pick up deal stalwarts like the AirPods 4 with ANC or Google’s TV Streamer (4K). We also stumbled upon a deal that knocks $5 off a pair of Lego Roses, as well as another that lets both new and returning subscribers snag a month of Apple TV Plus, completely free of charge.So let’s get into it, shall we?RelatedSonos’ Super Bowl sale knocks hundreds off its audio gearFeatured ProductsPreviousNextApple Airpods 4 with ANCRead More$119 at Amazon$119 at WalmartLego RosesRead More$10 at Amazon$10 at WalmartGoogle TV Streamer (4K)Read More$80 at Amazon$80 at GoogleApple TV Plus (30-day trial)Read More$0 at AppleIf you can afford it, I highly recommend the AirPods Pro 3, which are on sale at Amazon and Walmart right now for $199 ($50 off). However, if you’re an Apple user looking to save some cash, the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation make for a surprisingly good alternative, especially since they’re on sale at Amazon and Walmart for $119 — about $20 shy of the all-time low we saw during Black Friday.Despite their open-style design, the AirPods 4 with ANC offer the best sound of any AirPods to date (save the Pro models). The noise cancellation is remarkably effective at lowering the volume of the outside world, and because they’re an Apple product, they’re loaded with all the usual ecosystem tricks. That means you’ll get support for head-tracking spatial audio, automatic device switching, and live translation courtesy of iOS 26. The ANC also packs a few Pro-level features, including wireless charging and a built-in speaker on the charging case that lets you track it via Apple’s Find My app.Read our AirPods 4 review.Apple Airpods 4 with ANC$119$17934% off$119$119 at Amazon$119 at Walmart$180 at Best BuyReady or not, Valentine’s Day is right around the corner. Per usual, we’ll be publishing several gift guides in the run-up to the main event on Sunday, February 14th; however, if you want to get a head start on shopping for your supposed sweetheart, Lego’s Roses are on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Target for around $9.91 (about $5 off), nearly matching their best price to date. Lego does sell more robust floral sets — hell, you can currently buy a dozen stems for around $55 — but this 120-piece kit feels like a more subtle surprise. Just pair it with an actual vase, and voila: instant brownie points.Lego Roses$10$1533% off$10$10 at Amazon$10 at Walmart$10 at TargetThese days, most TVs are equipped with a way to access Netflix, HBO Max, and a laundry list of other streaming apps. That said, a dedicated device like Google’s TV Streamer (4K) — which is now available from Amazon, Best Buy, and Google for $79.99 ($20 off), nearly matching its all-time low— can provide better customization, faster performance, and more advanced search functionality than many 4K TVs.Google’s speedy Chromecast follow-up supports both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, along with a handy Find My feature that lets you locate the remote when it inevitably falls between your couch cushions. It can also cobble together recommendations from across streaming services, and thanks to its built-in support for both Matter and Thread, you can leverage it as a smart home hub, making it easy to control your lights or view livestreams from connected cameras. We just wish it weren’t limited to Wi-Fi 5, even if the built-in ethernet port does help.Read our full Google TV Streamer (4K) review.Google TV Streamer (4K)$80$10020% off$80$80 at Amazon$80 at Google$80 at Best BuyIn case you weren’t aware, Apple TV Plus has basically become the streaming service if you’re a sci-fi fan, with recent standouts like Vince Gilligan’s Pluribus further cementing its status in recent months. Thankfully, if you hadn’t had an opportunity to dig into the streamer’s movie and TV catalog, both new and qualified returning subscribers can currently sign up for a free 30-day trial for a limited time.If you’re not into interstellar travel or hive mind antics, rest assured that you have other options. The second season of the high-stakes wine drama Drops of God and the third season of Shrinking — an excellent comedy starring Jason Segel — are now underway, and the next season of Ted Lasso is (finally) set to premiere this summer after a three-year absence. Just be sure to cancel your membership before the trial period ends; otherwise, it will renew at the current rate of $12.99 a month.Apple TV Plus (30-day trial)$0$0$0 at AppleMore ways to save this weekendAnker’s MagGo charging puck has returned to $14.99 ($15 off) at Amazon, matching its lowest price to date. The Qi2-certified charger only outputs up to 15W of power, and while the newest iPhone models technically support up to 25W wireless charging, you’re likely going to have to pay a premium for the privilege. Anker’s Qi2 offering is cheap, effective, and comes with a five-foot cable you can plug into either your laptop or a power adapter.My go-to smart speaker rec for family and friends, the Sonos Era 100, is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Sonos’ online storefront for $179 ($40 off), its second-best price to date. The feature-packed speaker sounds noticeably better than the last-gen Sonos One, with improved bass response and support for stereo playback. It’s also equipped with Bluetooth, and like the larger Era 300, it lets you listen to wired audio sources via line-in — assuming you pick up a 3.5mm to USB-C adapter, that is.

I’m a big fan of the game’s chibi miniature-style art design and its clever open-world formula, which, while a little formulaic, is still fitting for Princess Zelda’s first solo outing on the Nintendo Switch.

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.It’s no secret that Cassette Boy is inspired by the classics. It’s a top-down adventure game in the vein of a retro Legend of Zelda, while your home base is a small town like in an older Pokémon game, complete with a mom who is constantly wishing you well. The game’s blocky 3D graphics evoke Minecraft, and you save at campfires that reset the world, like a FromSoft game. Everything in Cassette Boy even has a green tint that reminds me of playing games on my original Game Boy. But despite all of the clear influences, it still feels unique: underneath that charming exterior, Cassette Boy is a game filled with clever puzzles that forced me to use my head in ways I haven’t before.The game’s main mechanic revolves around an idea “inspired by” quantum mechanics: if you can’t see something in the game, it ceases to “exist” and remains in an essentially frozen state from the moment it went off-screen. If you push a block behind a wall, it’s not “there” anymore, and you can walk behind that wall without being impeded by the box. If an enemy goes fully behind a wall, it becomes invisible, will stop moving, and can’t damage you. Since it doesn’t exist, you also can’t damage it. The game also lets you rotate the camera to eight different points; imagine it’s on a compass, and with a tap of a shoulder button, you can rotate it to the north “point,” then northwest, then east, etc. So, with that hidden enemy, if you turn the camera so that it’s not behind the wall, it “reappears” and becomes a physical being again.PreviousNext1/4If you tap a shoulder button… Image: Pocketpair PublishingCassette Boy then sets up a bunch of puzzles that force you to mess with perspective to overcome obstacles. Early on, you’ll come across a button that makes a platform appear on a river when the button is pressed down, and the button is next to a boulder. Everyone who has played a Zelda game knows that the usual solution would be to move the boulder to keep the button down. But you can’t pick up the boulder in Cassette Boy; instead, the solution is to step on the button and then turn the camera so that the boulder entirely hides the pressed-down button. That way, the button becomes frozen while pressed down, allowing you to hop on the platform to get to the other side of the river.In addition to moving the camera, you get tools like a bow and arrow to hit switches and enemies from a distance and cassette tapes that give you powers to see bombable walls or shrink you down. When it all comes together, Cassette Boy is really satisfying: when I was in the zone, I couldn’t wait to pick apart every new room to work through puzzles and search for hidden treasures tucked away out of sight. There are also clever battles against giant, blocky bosses, all to earn moon fragments (the main MacGuffin you’re tasked to find).Sometimes, though, Cassette Boy can be obtuse. There are no maps to refer to. You often have to talk to the exact right person at the exact right time to move the main quest forward, and you don’t have much of an indication of who that might be except for a speech bubble over their heads. After you collect a moon fragment, the game will send you back to the main town but won’t tell you where to go, so I often got frustrated having to seek out all of the townspeople over and over again. Some of the puzzles also totally stumped me, and I usually had a full-game walkthrough open during my nearly eight-hour playthrough so that I could get hints on how to progress next.But I also think all that obtuseness is by design, and it harkens back to the game’s inspirations. With older Zelda and Pokémon games, I have fond memories of wandering around, getting lost, and eventually finding my way back on course with a sigh of relief. With all the time I spent struggling, I was forced to learn my way around those worlds, and now I can recall how to get through the toughest parts of those games even though I haven’t played them for years. (Even the developers of Breath of the Wild think that getting lost can be a “very positive thing.”)Cassette Boy evokes that old-school spirit. Even when it frustrated me, I usually didn’t mind the struggle, and it helped me learn my way around. Usually, I realized that finding the right way forward just required a new perspective.Cassette Boy is now available on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersSenior ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All by Jay PetersEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All EntertainmentGames ReviewCloseGames ReviewPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All Games ReviewGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All GamingMore in: The best indie games we’re playing right nowThis coming-of-age adventure game made me feel a little too seenJay CastelloJan 24Detective games get extra cryptic with TR-49’s code-breaking mysteryAndrew WebsterJan 21A cute frog game that remixes Nintendo’s bestJay PetersJan 17Most PopularMost PopularTesla throws in the towel on car salesThere’s a social network for AI agents, and it’s getting weirdVideo game company stock prices dip after Google introduces an AI world-generation toolJeffrey Epstein was permanently banned from Xbox LiveThe latest Instax printer is a pricey but worthy upgradeThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Citations to Elon Musk’s AI-generated encyclopedia are starting to appear in answers from Google’s AI Overviews, AI Mode, and Gemini, too. Data suggests that’s on the rise, heightening concerns about accuracy and misinformation as Musk seeks to reshape reality in his image.Since the warped Wikipedia-clone launched late last October, Grokipedia technically remains a minor source of information overall. Glen Allsopp, head of marketing strategy and research at SEO company Ahrefs, told The Verge the firm’s testing found Grokipedia referenced in more than 263,000 ChatGPT responses from 13.6 million prompts, citing roughly 95,000 individual Grokipedia pages. By comparison, Allsopp said the English-language Wikipedia showed up in 2.9 million responses. “They’re quite a way off, but it’s still impressive for how new they are,” he said.“They’re quite a way off, but it’s still impressive for how new they are.”Based on a dataset tracking billions of citations, marketing platform Profound researcher Sartaj Rajpal said Grokipedia received around 0.01 to 0.02 percent of all ChatGPT citations per day — a small share but one that has steadily increased since mid-November.Semrush, which tracks how brands show up in Google tools’ AI answers with its AI Visibility Toolkit, found a similar step-up in Grokipedia’s visibility in AI answers from December, but noted it’s still very much a secondary source compared to established reference platforms like Wikipedia.Grokipedia citations appear on ChatGPT more than on any other platform that analysts The Verge spoke to are tracking. However, Semrush found a similar spike in Google’s AI products — Gemini, AI Overviews, and AI Mode — in December. Ahrefs’ Allsopp said Grokipedia had been referenced in around 8,600 Gemini answers, 567 AI Overviews answers, 7,700 Copilot answers, and 2 Perplexity answers, from around 9.5 million, 120 million, 14 million, and 14 million prompts, respectively, with appearances in Gemini and Perplexity down significantly from similar testing the month before. None of the firms The Verge spoke to track citations for Anthropic’s Claude, though several anecdotal reports on social media suggest the chatbot is also citing Grokipedia as a source.In many cases, AI tools appear to be citing Grokipedia to answer niche, obscure, or highly specific factual questions, as The Guardian reported late last week. Analysts agree. Jim Yu, CEO of analytics firm BrightEdge, told The Verge that ChatGPT and AI Overviews use Grokipedia for largely “non-sensitive queries” like encyclopedic lookups and definitions, though differences are emerging in how much authority they afford it. For AI Overviews, Grokipedia tends not to stand alone, Yu said, and “typically appears alongside several other sources” as “a supplementary reference rather than a primary source.” When ChatGPT uses Grokipedia as a source, however, it gives it much more authority, Yu said, “often featuring it as one of the first sources cited for a query.”RelatedGrokipedia is racist, transphobic, and loves Elon MuskAnyone can try to edit Grokipedia 0.2, but Grok is running the showX hasn’t really stopped Grok AI from undressing women in the UKEven for relatively mundane uses, experts warn using Grokipedia as a source risks spreading disinformation and promoting partisan talking points. Unlike Wikipedia, which is edited by humans in a transparent process, Grokipedia is produced by xAI’s chatbot Grok. Grok is perhaps best known for its Nazi meltdown, calling itself MechaHitler, idolizing Musk, and, most recently, digitally stripping people online, including minors. When it launched, a bulk of Grokipedia’s articles were direct clones of Wikipedia, though many others reflected racist and transphobic views. For example, articles about Musk conveniently downplays his family wealth and unsavory elements of their past (like neo-Nazi and pro-Apartheid views) and the entry for “gay pornography” falsely linked the material to the worsening of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. The article on US slavery still contains a lengthy section on “ideological justifications,” including the “Shift from Necessary Evil to Positive Good.” Editing is also overseen by Grok and is similarly flawed. Grokipedia is more susceptible to what is known as “LLM grooming,” or data poisoning.In a comment to The Verge, OpenAI spokesperson Shaokyi Amdo said: “When ChatGPT searches the web, it aims to draw from a broad range of publicly available sources and viewpoints relevant to the user’s question.” Amdo also said that users can see the sources and judge them themselves: “We apply safety filters to reduce the risk of surfacing links associated with high-severity harms, and ChatGPT clearly shows which sources informed a response through citations, allowing users to explore and assess the reliability of sources directly.”“ChatGPT clearly shows which sources informed a response through citations, allowing users to explore and assess the reliability of sources directly.”Perplexity spokesperson Beejoli Shah would not comment about the risks of LLM grooming or citing AI-generated material like Grokipedia, but said the company’s “central advantage in search is accuracy,” which it is “relentlessly focused on.” Anthropic declined to answer on the record. xAI did not return The Verge’s request for comment. Google declined to comment.The point is that Grokipedia can’t be reliably cited as a source at all, no matter how infrequently and despite Musk taking an unsubstantiated victory lap about the encyclopedia’s alleged wild success in Google Search results. It is an AI-generated system, lacking in human oversight, and often reliant on opaque, hard-to-verify material like personal websites and blog posts, and questionable, potentially circular, sourcing. There’s a real risk of reinforcing various biases, errors, or framing issues if it cites something like Grokipedia, said Taha Yasseri, chair of technology and society at Trinity College Dublin, adding that “fluency can easily be mistaken for reliability.”“Grokipedia feels like a cosplay of credibility,” said Leigh McKenzie, director of online visibility at Semrush. “It might work inside its own bubble, but the idea that Google or OpenAI would treat something like Grokipedia as a serious, default reference layer at scale is bleak.”Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Robert HartCloseRobert HartAI ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All by Robert HartAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All AIReportCloseReportPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All ReportTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All TechxAIClosexAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All xAIMost PopularMost PopularTesla throws in the towel on car salesThere’s a social network for AI agents, and it’s getting weirdVideo game company stock prices dip after Google introduces an AI world-generation toolJeffrey Epstein was permanently banned from Xbox LiveThe latest Instax printer is a pricey but worthy upgradeThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

(If you’re new here, welcome, send Arc Raiders tips, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.)This week, I’ve been reading about wind turbines and phishing scams and oboes, keeping organized with the ultra-minimal Attn app, testing the lovely Aeronaut Bluesky client, spending too much time researching electric snow shovels, finally upgrading my trusty podcast headphones to a new Beyerdynamic pair, starting my umpteenth rewatch of Superstore, and debating whether to swap my iPhone 16 for an iPhone 17 or a Pixel 10. I think I’m going Pixel.I also have for you a nice upgrade to an Apple gadget, a great new AI search tool, a couple of excellent new things to watch, new Sonos gear, and much more.And I have a question: What’s your favorite non-Big Tech piece of tech? I’m hearing from a lot of people who, for a variety of reasons, want to ditch devices and services from Google or Apple or Amazon or Microsoft or any number of other companies. If you have, and you’ve had a great experience, tell me about it! I’m installer@theverge.com and @davidpierce.11 on Signal, and I want to hear everything you like.

This is great timing, because all my AirTag batteries are dying. I’m most excited by the new model’s louder speaker, but it’s full of little upgrades that should make this very simple, very useful gadget just a little better at everything.Yahoo Scout. This is already straight-up my favorite AI search product on the web. It has lots of links, it’s not weirdly friendly or overly complex — it’s kind of like an auto-generating Wikipedia page, on whatever subject you pick. Just make sure you click the links instead of believing the bot, you know?Crushable. Big week for Yahoo, apparently! This is Wordle meets Candy Crush, if that makes any sense? I do like the idea of a finite version of games like this that incentivize you to just play a few minutes a day. Also, TIL the Yahoo Games app exists. And is pretty good.OpenClaw. Don’t call it Moltbot, or Clawdbot — it’s apparently OpenClaw now. Whatever the name, this tool for controlling your devices with AI and messaging apps has absolutely taken over the internet. Use it with caution, but my goodness is it powerful. Wonder Man. Today I learned Wonder Man is a thing that exists? As skeptical as I am of every new Marvel creation these days, the reviews for this series have been solid, and love that it seems to barely even want to be a superhero show. Shrinking season 3. This show has just continued to deliver, and I’ve officially reached the “I hope they make a billion episodes and I will watch every single one” stage of my fandom. Plus, there is apparently even more star power this season?!Halide Mark III. A big (though still in preview) upgrade to one of the best iOS camera apps. Process Zero is one of the best ways to take phone pictures, if you ask me, and I already dig the new film-simulation preset as well. The Sonos Amp Multi. The first new Sonos hardware in a minute, and it’s not exactly a mainstream gadget: It’s meant for people designing and installing huge and complex systems. But hey, if that’s you, this thing might be a godsend.Chrome auto browse. AI agents are quickly becoming table stakes for any web browser, despite the fact they don’t often work very well. But frankly, if anyone can put the pieces together successfully and navigate the web on your behalf, it’s Google. I’ll be testing this one a lot.Screen shareHe probably doesn’t know this, but Christopher Mims (who I believe I have never referred to as anything other than “Mims”) gave me some of the best writing advice I’ve ever gotten. Back when we used to work together at The Wall Street Journal, where he is a tech columnist, he taught me a ton about how to be crisp and clear, and most of all how to just say the thing you mean right up top.Case in point: Mims’ new book, How to AI, which just came out this week. I’m most of the way through it, and so far it is excellent; simple, thorough, understandable, neither dedicated to explaining why AI is a god that will save us or to trying to tear it to shreds. It is exactly what the title suggests. It’s great.I asked Mims to share his homescreen, and some stuff he’s into, just to see if he’d really gone full AI or not. I have good news:The phone: I had to check the settings. I know. It’s an iPhone 15. I’m a “work gave me this phone” guy. It really doesn’t matter these days, I can’t believe anyone cares whether their phone is newer than, say, 2-3 generations ago, unless they’re using it constantly for photography or shooting videos.The wallpaper: Apple’s generic “here’s Earth from space right now.” I like to be reminded we are, as Carl Sagan said, a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.The apps: Google Keep, Google Tasks, Chrome, Hark, Google Maps, Spotify, Overcast, BitCam, Camera, Phone, Messages.In the lower-left corner is BitCam. If you have an attachment to the original black-and-white dithering algorithm, and like the way high-contrast photos look in it, it’s for you. On the right side is Hark, which I love because it’s the only podcast clipper / aggregator I know of and their editorial judgment is exquisite.I also asked Mims to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he sent back:Bluesky is good now, just don’t tell anyone. The BBC has started posting really deep cuts from its archive, including a documentary about windmills that is so painterly it could be screened at MoMA. I remain a forever Polytopia addict, it calms me. I’ve recently discovered the trick of recording all my calls while also taking actual handwritten notes during them, which has increased my recall and comprehension while relieving the pressure to capture every detail of an interview or meeting. Maria Konnikova, a world-class poker player who also happens to be one of the most talented science writers of our generation, has a great newsletter item on the science behind why this works.CrowdsourcedHere’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. For even more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads and this post on Bluesky.“I’ve been obsessing over The Roottrees are Dead, a game where you play an investigator in 1998 attempting to put together a family tree. You do this using era-appropriate internet search engines and a corkboard with string. Also the soundtrack that plays is the perfect vibe.” — Jonathan“I use Apple’s Home app to control all the smart stuff in the house. I installed Wemo light switches six-ish years ago. They never worked consistently. Recently swapped them out for these Matter-enabled Tapo ones. Whether it’s Matter or six-years-newer technology, they haven’t lost connection with the Home app once. Highly recommended.” — Ryan“The Mecha Comet is a modular Linux handheld and I’ve fallen in love with it!” — @trainsandinternet“I’m playing through Halo: The Master Chief Collection, and lamenting over how badly Microsoft dropped the ball with this iconic IP. (You had Cortana, that could’ve been your cool AI assistant, but you killed it?! And the Halo TV series! And the latest Halo games!)” — Anshuman“Watching Send Help, aka the third gory horror movie I’ve seen in the cinemas this month.” — Kev“I recently discovered FocusFlight, and it has become the app I turn to when I need to dive into focused work. It’s a really cool mix of ideas, and as an aviation nut, it’s a great app for me to use while I’m trying to stay focused on work or any other activity. It does need to cut back on the number of taps needed to start a session, but it’s a really solid idea that recently added a mode where you can watch the clouds fly by your airplane window while you focus.” — Adam“My Fiio Snowsky Disc DAP AliExpress order came in last weekend, and I’ve been having lots of fun with it this week. It’s modeled to call back to an earlier generation of music players, this time a minidisc unit. Extremely tiny (palm-sized unit), can slap a sizable microSD card in it, and has great sound quality and power output.” — Brian“The newest Pokémon TCG Pocket update just dropped this week, so I’ll be ripping packs and building some fun new decks. Excited about Stadium cards finally in the game!” — Bob“I wanted to recommend Blood on the Clocktower :) It’s a social deduction game, similar to Mafia, Werewolf, or Among Us, but it has the added advantage of making every role useful and players can participate even after their death. It’s really having a moment, thanks to No Rolls Barred and Good Time Society featuring a lot of the Dropout cast in their recent games. I love watching all the showcases of how games can be run, and I hope to find a group to play it with one day!” — JackSigning offI’ve written about this before here, but I’ve become totally enamored with the concept of local-first software. The idea is straightforward: that software should not be designed on the assumption that it’s accessing a bunch of your data in the cloud, but that everything it needs is already on your device. It should still have all the features you want, be available everywhere, and be totally collaborative, but it should come with all the speed and security of a bunch of files on your computer. Loading screens are the enemy.The team at Ink & Switch wrote a great essay about local-first software a while back, and this week I stumbled on CultRepo’s 10-minute YouTube doc that digs in on the concept even more. The whole thing just makes sense to me, and the local-first tenets are already changing how I look for and use software.
