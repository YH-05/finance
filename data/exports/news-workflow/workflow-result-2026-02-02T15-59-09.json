          "body_text": "Notepad++ Hijacked by State-Sponsored Hackers\n2026-02-02\nFollowing the security disclosure published in the v8.8.9 announcement\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/v889-released/\nthe investigation has continued in collaboration with external experts and with the full involvement of my (now former) shared hosting provider.\nAccording to the analysis provided by the security experts, the attack involved infrastructure-level compromise that allowed malicious actors to intercept and redirect update traffic destined for notepad-plus-plus.org. The exact technical mechanism remains under investigation, though the compromise occured at the hosting provider level rather than through vulnerabilities in Notepad++ code itself. Traffic from certain targeted users was selectively redirected to attacker-controlled served malicious update manifests.\nThe incident began from June 2025. Multiple independaent security researchers have assessed that the threat acotor is likely a Chinese state-sponsored group, which would explain the highly selective targeting obseved during the campaign.\nAn incident-response (IR) plan was proposed by the security expert, and I facilitated direct communication between the hosting provider and the IR team. After the IR team engaged with the provider and reviewed the situation, I received the following detailed statement from the provider:\nDear Customer,\nWe want to further update you following the previous communication with us about your server compromise and further investigation with your incident response team.\nWe discovered the suspicious events in our logs, which indicate that the server (where your application https://notepad-plus-plus.org/update/getDownloadUrl.php was hosted until the 1st of December, 2025) could have been compromised.\nAs a precautionary measure, we immediately transferred all clients’ web hosting subscriptions from this server to a new server and continued our further investigation.\nHere are the key finding points:\n1. The shared hosting server in question was compromised until the 2nd of September, 2025. On this particular date, the server had scheduled maintenance where the kernel and firmware were updated. After this date, we could not identify any similar patterns in logs, and this indicates that bad actors have lost access to the server. We also find no evidence of similar patterns on any other shared hosting servers.\n2. Even though the bad actors have lost access to the server from the 2nd of September, 2025, they maintained the credentials of our internal services existing on that server until the 2nd of December, which could have allowed the malicious actors to redirect some of the traffic going to https://notepad-plus-plus.org/getDownloadUrl.php to their own servers and return the updates download URL with compromised updates.\n3. Based on our logs, we see no other clients hosted on this particular server being targeted. The bad actors specifically searched for https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ domain with the goal to intercept the traffic to your website, as they might know the then-existing Notepad++ vulnerabilities related to insufficient update verification controls.\n4. After concluding our research, the investigated security findings were no longer observed in the web hosting systems from the 2nd of December, 2025, and onwards, as:\n* We have fixed vulnerabilities, which could have been used to target Notepad++. In particular, we do have logs indicating that the bad actor tried to re-exploit one of the fixed vulnerabilities; however, the attempt did not succeed after the fix was implemented.\n* We have rotated all the credentials that bad actors could have obtained until the 2nd of September, 2025.\n* We have checked the logs for similar patterns in all web hosting servers and couldn’t find any evidence of systems being compromised, exploited in a similar way, or data breached.\nWhile we have rotated all the secrets on our end, below you will find the preventive actions you should take to maximize your security. However, if below actions have been done after the 2nd of December, 2025, no actions are needed from your side.\n* Change credentials for SSH, FTP/SFTP, and MySQL database.\n* Review administrator accounts for your WordPress sites (if you have any), change their passwords, and remove unnecessary users.\n* Update your WordPress sites (if you have any) plugins, themes, and core version, and turn on automatic updates, if applicable.\nWe appreciate your cooperation and understanding. Please let us know in case you have any questions.\nTL;DR\nAccording to the former hosting provider, the shared hosting server was compromised until September 2, 2025. Even after losing server access, attackers maintained credentials to internal services until December 2, 2025, which allowed them to continue redirecting Notepad++ update traffic to malicious servers. The attackers specifically targeted Notepad++ domain with the goal of exploiting insufficient update verification controls that existed in older versions of Notepad++.\nAll remediation and security hardening were completed by the provider by December 2, 2025, successfully blocking further attacker activity.\nNote on timelines: The security exper’s analysis indicates the attack ceased on November 10, 2025, while the hosting provider’s statement shows potential attacker access until December 2, 2025. Based on both assessment, I estimate the overall compromise period spanned from June through December 2, 2025, when all attacker access was definitively terminated.\nI deeply apologize to all users affected by this hijacking. To address this this severe security issue, the Notepad++ website has been migrated to a new hosting provider with significantly stronger security practices.\nWithin Notepad++ itself, WinGup (the updater) was enhanced in v8.8.9 to verify both the certificate and the signature of the downloaded installer. Additionally, the XML returned by the update server is now singed (XMLDSig), and the certificate & signature verification will be enforced starting with upcoming v8.9.2, expected in about one month.\nWith these changes and reinforcements, I believe the situation has been fully resolved.\nFingers crossed.",

          "body_text": "Two kinds of AI users are emerging. The gap between them is astonishing.\nFebruary 1, 2026\n·\nMartin Alderson\nIt still shocks me how much difference there is between AI users. I think it explains a lot about the often confusing (to me) coverage in the media about AI and its productivity impact.\nI think it's clear there are two types of users to me now, and by extension, the organisations they work for.\nFirst, you have the \"power users\", who are all in on adopting new AI technology - Claude Code, MCPs, skills, etc. Surprisingly, these people are often not very technical. I've seen far more non-technical people than I'd expect using Claude Code in terminal, using it for dozens of non-SWE tasks. Finance roles seem to be getting enormous value out of it (unsurprisingly, as Excel on the finance side is remarkably limiting when you start getting used to the power of a full programming ecosystem like Python).\nSecondly, you have the people who are generally only chatting to ChatGPT or similar. So many people I wouldn't expect are still in this camp.\nM365 Copilot has a lot to answer for\nOne extremely jarring realisation was just how poor Microsoft Copilot is. It has enormous market share in enterprise as it is bundled in with various Office 365 subscriptions, yet feels like a poorly cloned version of the (already not great) ChatGPT interface. The \"agent\" feature is absolutely laughable compared to what a CLI coding agent (including Microsoft's own GitHub confusingly-named-Copilot CLI).\nTo really underline this, Microsoft itself is rolling out Claude Code to internal teams[1], despite (obviously) having access to Copilot at near zero cost, and significant ownership of OpenAI. I think this sums up quite how far behind they are\nThe problem is that in enterprise Copilot is often the only allowed AI tool, so that's all you can use without either potentially losing your job or spending a lot of effort trying to procure and use another AI tool. It's slow, the code execution tool in it doesn't work properly and fails horribly with large(ish) files, seemingly due to very very aggressive memory and CPU limitations.\nThis is becoming an existential risk for many enterprises. Senior decision makers are no doubt using these tools with such poor results and are therefore writing off AI, and/or spending a fortune with various large consulting and management consultancy outfits to get not very far.\nWhy enterprise is so at risk\nEnterprise corporate IT policy results in a completely disastrous combination of limitations that basically ensure that people cannot successfully use more 'cutting edge' AI tooling.\nFirstly, they tend to have extremely locked down environments, with no ability to run even a basic script interpreter locally (VBA if you are lucky, but even that may be limited by various Group Policies). Secondly, they're locked into legacy software with no real \"internal facing\" APIs on their core workflows, which means agents have nothing to connect to even if you could run them.\nFinally, they tend to have extremely siloed engineering departments (which may be completely outsourced), so there's nobody internally who could build the infrastructure to run safely sandboxed agents even if they wanted to.\nThe security concerns are real. You definitely do not want people YOLOing coding agents over production databases with no control, and as I've covered, sandboxing agents is difficult[2].\nHowever, this does cause a real problem in so much that you don't have an engineering team that can help build the infrastructure to run safely sandboxed agents against your datasets.\nThe gap\nI've also spoken to many smaller companies that don't have all this baggage and are absolutely flying with AI. The gap is so obvious when you can see both sides of it.\nOn one hand, you have Microsoft's (awful) Copilot integration for Excel (in fairness, the Gemini integration in Google Sheets is also bad). So you can imagine financial directors trying to use it and it making a complete mess of the most simple tasks and never touching it again.\nOn the other you have a non-technical executive who's got his head round Claude Code and can run e.g. Python locally. I helped one recently almost one-shot[3] converting a 30 sheet mind numbingly complicated Excel financial model to Python with Claude Code.\nOnce the model is in Python, you effectively have a data science team in your pocket with Claude Code. You can easily run Monte Carlo simulations, pull external data sources as inputs, build web dashboards and have Claude Code work with you to really integrate weaknesses in your model (or business). It's a pretty magical experience watching someone realise they have so much power at their fingertips, without having to grind away for hours/days in Excel.\nThis effectively leads to a situation where smaller company employees are able to be so much more productive than the equivalent at an enterprise. It often used to be that people at small companies really envied the resources & teams that their larger competitors had access to - but increasingly I think the pendulum is swinging the other way.\nThe future\nI'm starting to get a feel for what the future of work looks like. The first observation is that (often) the real leaps are being made organically by employees, not from a top down AI strategy. Where I see the real productivity gains are small teams deciding to try and build an AI assisted workflow for a process, and as they are the ones that know that process inside out they can get very good results - unlike an often outsourced software engineering team who have absolutely zero experience doing the process that they are helping automate. I think this is the opposite of what most 'digital transformation' projects looked like in enterprise.\nSecondly, companies that have some sort of APIs for internal systems are going to be able to do far more than those that don't. This might be as simple as a readonly data warehouse employees can connect to and run queries on behalf of users, or it could be as far as many complex core business processes being completely APId.\nThirdly, this all needs to be wrapped up in some sort of secure mechanism, but I actually think a hosted VM running some sort of code agent with well thought through network restrictions would work well, at least for read only reporting. For creating and editing data I don't think we quite have the model for non technical users (especially) to be able to use agents safely (yet).\nFinally, legacy enterprise SaaS players either have enormous lock in, or are extremely vulnerable depending on how you look at it. Most are not \"API-first\" products, and the APIs they have tend to be really for developer usage - not optimised for thousands of employees to ping in weird and wonderful inefficient ways. But if they are the source of truth for the company, they are going to be very difficult to migrate away from and bottleneck a lot of productivity gains.\nAgain, smaller companies tend to use newer products which have far better thought through APIs (simply because they weren't often originally created many decades ago with various interfaces grafted on over time).\nThe user prompts, the agent synthesises - connecting to APIs and producing outputs on demand.\nWhat I've come to realise is that the power of having a bash sandbox with a programming language and API access to systems, combined with an agentic harness, results in outrageously good results for non technical users. It can effectively replace nearly every standard productivity app out there - both classic Microsoft Office style ones - and also web apps. It can build any report you ask for - and export it however you like. To me this seems like the future of knowledge work.\nThe bifurcation is real and seems to be, if anything, speeding up dramatically. I don't think there's ever been a time in history where a tiny team can outcompete a company one thousand times its size so easily.\nMicrosoft is using Claude Code internally while selling you Copilot ↩︎\nLet's keep in mind that users already have access to these systems. CISOs need to figure out how to enable these kind of secure VMs en masse. There's already precedent for this with Codespaces - it just requires a similar approach scaled up to the entire organisation. ↩︎\nTwo or three prompts got it there, using plan mode to figure out the structure of the Excel sheet, then prompting to implement it. It even added unit tests to the Python model itself, which I was impressed with! ↩︎\nIf you found this useful, I write about AI tooling and software development monthly.

(0)0LCCc1-0.03%CC-0.29%BARN1.20% By Oliver Hirt, May Angel and Amy-Jo Crowley ZURICH/LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Barry Callebaut and its former CEO Peter Feld parted ways last month after a previously unreported clash at the top of the world’s largest chocolate maker over a proposal to separate its cocoa business, two sources told Reuters. Members of Barry Callebaut’s board, including its chairman Patrick De Maeseneire, opposed the plan, the sources said. Cocoa accounted for 31% of Barry Callebaut’s total sales revenue and 15.5% of its operating profit in 2024/25. Reuters reported in December that Barry Callebaut was in the early stages of looking into separating the lower-margin cocoa unit and possibly selling a minority stake at a later stage. Feld and De Maeseneire did not respond to Reuters emails and calls seeking comment on the split within Barry Callebaut’s leadership or the CEO’s sudden exit from the Zurich-based firm. Barry Callebaut, which supplies chocolate for Magnum ice cream and Nestle KitKat bars, named ex-Unilever boss Hein Schumacher on January 21 to replace Feld, who joined the Swiss company as chief executive in 2023. \"One reason for the departure was diverging views regarding the company’s future strategy,\" a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, asking not to be named because they were not authorised to speak publicly. \"The CEO was open to considering a separation of the cocoa unit and a potential transaction, but for parts of the Board - led by the chairman - this was a non-starter,\" they added. Barry Callebaut declined to comment on any disagreement between the former CEO and its board. It said the Swiss company has a \"fully integrated cocoa and chocolate business model\". ’A NEW PHASE OF GROWTH’ One of the sources said that Barry Callebaut’s board, which had initially been more supportive of a split, backed off from the idea, leading to a clash with Feld over strategy at the company, whose ingredients are used in about one in four chocolate and cocoa products consumed globally.  Both sides agreed that a change was needed, the source said, adding that there were also other areas of disagreement, including on the level of investment in digitalization. Reuters earlier reported that the proposal for separating the cocoa business was aimed at reducing Barry Callebaut’s exposure to volatile prices for the chocolate ingredient. Cocoa demand has collapsed after a 2024 price surge, falling to 21-year lows in the fourth quarter of last year in Europe as chocolate makers shrink product sizes and reformulate recipes. Barry Callebaut processes almost 1 million metric tons of cocoa a year, a fifth of global volume, and so is more exposed to price fluctuations than consumer-facing chocolate firms, who outsource some production to companies such as the Swiss group. Separating the cocoa processing arm could allow Barry Callebaut to protect itself from commodity price swings, focus resources on its higher-margin chocolate business and optimise its financing, sources previously told Reuters. The second source, who is close to the company, also said that there had been disagreement within the higher ranks of Barry Callebaut over the idea of separating the cocoa business. In an internal memo to employees seen by Reuters, Barry Callebaut said that with its transition programme nearly complete and the company moving to \"a new phase of growth\", now was the right time for a CEO transition. Schumacher was \"the right leader at this stage to chart Barry Callebaut’s next phase... based on our fully integrated cocoa and chocolate business model\", the memo read.\nArtisan Partners, which has a stake of some 10% in Barry Callebaut, welcomed Schumacher’s appointment and indicated it should keep the cocoa unit which gives it \"vertical integration\". \"I think it’s just a competitive advantage,\" David Samra, a managing director at Artisan Partners, told Reuters.  Exclusive-Barry Callebaut CEO left after high-level split over cocoa, sources sayView all comments (0)0Latest commentsPostComment GuidelinesTrade With A Regulated BrokerIndicesCommoditiesBondsStocksUS 30 48,498.80-393.7-0.81%US 500 6,852.90-86.1-1.24%Dow Jones 48,892.47-179.09-0.36%S&P 500 6,939.03-29.98-0.43%Nasdaq 23,461.82-223.30-0.94%S&P 500 VIX 17.44+0.56+3.32%Dollar Index 97.11+0.251+0.26%Crude Oil WTI Futures61.65-3.56-5.46%Brent Oil Futures65.69-3.63-5.24%Natural Gas Futures3.65-0.704-16.17%Gold Futures4,551.69-193.41-4.08%Silver Futures75.293-3.239-4.12%Copper Futures5.6338-0.2903-4.90%US Soybeans Futures1,053.50-10.75-1.01%U.S. 10Y 4.221-0.023-0.54%U.S. 30Y 4.863-0.009-0.18%U.S. 5Y 3.766-0.032-0.84%U.S. 3M 3.666+0.005+0.14%US 10Y T-Note Futures112.05+0.22+0.20%Euro Bund Futures128.35+0.18+0.14%10-2 Yield Spread 31.32+4.15+15.27%AAPL259.48+1.20+0.46%NVDA191.13-1.38-0.72%GOOGL338.00-0.25-0.07%TSLA430.41+13.85+3.32%AMZN239.30-2.43-1.01%NFLX83.49+0.33+0.40%META716.50-21.81-2.95%Investing ChallengesJoin our investing challenges and compete for rewards while you learn!Take the ChallengeMost Popular ArticlesNewsAnalysisAsia stocks tumble amid AI jitters on Wall St; KOSPI plunges 5%By Investing.co...Feb 02, 2026Gold prices slide 5%, extend losses after Warsh Fed nominationBy Investing.co...Feb 02, 2026How does a weaker dollar impact gold and Bitcoin?By Investing.co...Feb 01, 2026Instant View: Markets plunge as precious metals meltdown spills overBy ReutersFeb 02, 2026Stocks slide in Asia as metals melt down, earnings loomBy ReutersFeb 02, 20261 Stock to Buy, 1 Stock to Sell This Week: Alphabet, StrategyBy Jesse CohenFeb 01, 2026Want SpaceX Before the IPO?

Job gains have remained low, and the unemployment rate has shown some signs of stabilization. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.\nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.\nIn support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 3‑1/2 to 3‑3/4 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.\nIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\nVoting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michael S. Barr; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Beth M. Hammack; Philip N. Jefferson; Neel Kashkari; Lorie K. Logan; and Anna Paulson. Voting against this action were Stephen I. Miran and Christopher J. Waller, who preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at this meeting.\nFor media inquiries, please email [email protected] or call 202-452-2955.\nImplementation Note issued January 28, 2026",
