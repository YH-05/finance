          "body_text": "gdpr\nGDPR is a failure\nI made 20 GDPR data deletion requests in the past year. 2 complied immediately. 6 complied after I filed complaints with data protection offices. 12 still haven't. The regulation exists, the enforcement doesn't.\nNikola\n03 Feb 2026\n• 5 min read\nGDPR is one of the things that both EU citizens like to brag about, and companies like to advertise with. But as someone who does make extensive use of it, the entire process is flawed, the laws are ignored, and enforcement is borderline impossible. It's the data protection equivalent of the cookie popups, which I'd even argue are more effective in their goal.Whenever a company has my data and uses it for marketing purposes without an easy opt out, or a company has my data and I stop using their services, I generally like to have the data deleted or to withdraw certain consent like for marketing purposes. Sometimes this is easy, but sometimes it requires invoking my GDPR rights as a EU citizen to actually get done.In the past year I have made around 20 GDPR data deletion/information requests to various companies. Only 2 have complied immediately, further 6 have complied after filing a complaint with the data protection office, the remaining 12 have not complied. Large companies, charities, companies that advertise explicitly with \"Made in EU/GDPR Compliant\". From Greenpeace, government funded museums, to open source companies, completely fail at this.💡I am aware that some data, such as invoices, or other data may be kept for longer period due to various financial laws. Whenever I speak of \"data\" in this article I'm referring to things like profile pictures, phone number(s), emails, stored addresses, online accounts viewable by others, and so on.GDPR for marketing onlyLet's look at how one of the bigger companies in 3D Printing world, that often gets mentioned for their privacy and the fact that they're from EU and GDPR compliant, Prusa 3D, handles a simple request to delete user data:Step one, change the user's emailStep two, say that you deleted the data:To this day, I still can view and verify that they have in fact not deleted my data. I even added a \"GDPR Failed\" address to my account after the email, so they're not even blocking it in some way.The email says \"request from 28 November 2025\", the truth is that I sent a GDPR deletion request in 2024, and this was just a reminder that they still haven't processed it. This is also after the \"GDPR Advisor\" saying that requesting data deletion via email isn't even legally allowed, which is completely wrong.Regulatory hellTaking the example from above, you'd think that a company blatantly ignoring a deletion request would be straightforward to report. Company has data, company was asked to delete it, company didn't. Open and shut.I reported Prusa to the Czech data protection office back in 2024 (case UOOUX00H3395). As of writing, they have never processed my request. They never replied to my follow-ups, written in both Czech and English. Nothing happened.The German data protection office was more responsive - they replied after about a month, telling me there's nothing they can do. Their only option would be to contact their Czech counterparts, and since I already did that, the chain ends there. So despite being a German citizen, my data protection rights depend entirely on the enforcement capacity and willingness of a foreign regulatory body.This is the reality for any cross-border GDPR complaint. The regulation is EU-wide, but enforcement is national. If the company sits in a country where the data protection office is underfunded, understaffed, or simply doesn't care, you're out of luck. Your only remaining option is to hire a lawyer, pay out of pocket, and sue a company in another country for something they should have done after a single email.Of the 12 companies that still haven't complied with my requests, the pattern is the same. The data protection office either didn't respond, didn't act, or the company simply ignored the office too. The data is still there. The accounts are still active. Nothing changed.The spam filter loopholeFor the 6 companies that did comply after I involved the data protection offices, most gave the same excuse: they never received the request.A few went further. They claimed their IT systems automatically categorized my GDPR request as spam and deleted it before anyone saw it. And the data protection agencies accepted this.Here's the exact legal reasoning I was given when I reported the Naturhistorisches Museum Wien - a government-funded museum, translated:According to Art. 12 (3) GDPR, the deadline for processing a request to exercise data subject rights only begins upon actual receipt by the controller. An email that is automatically processed by upstream IT security systems (e.g., spam or malware filters) and does not reach the responsible organizational units is legally not considered as received. The GDPR does not establish an obligation to manually review all automatically filtered messages.Read that again. A company can list an email address as their official GDPR contact in their privacy policy, and if their own spam filter eats your request, it legally never happened. There is no obligation to check. There is no obligation to ensure delivery. The burden is entirely on you to prove they received it.This isn't an edge case. This is a systemic loophole that allows any company to quietly discard data protection requests with zero consequences. Set up aggressive spam filtering on your GDPR inbox, and you've effectively opted out of the regulation.And if you do follow up, the clock resets. The 30-day response window from Art. 12 (3) starts from \"actual receipt,\" which means the company can play this game indefinitely.Changes are neededGDPR in its essence is not bad. The rights it grants are reasonable and necessary. But the enforcement infrastructure around it is broken, and without serious changes, it will remain a regulation that only those who already care about privacy comply with.Cross-border enforcement needs to actually work. If I'm a German citizen and a Czech company violates my rights, there needs to be a mechanism that doesn't dead-end at \"we forwarded it to the Czech office, good luck.\" The EU needs to either centralize cross-border complaints or give national offices the authority to enforce against companies in other member states directly.The spam filter loophole needs to die. Companies should be required to implement a standardized, verifiable request method. A web form, a dedicated portal, something that generates a confirmation and a timestamp. If a company lists only an email address for GDPR requests, they should be liable for delivery failures on their end. You can't advertise an email as the official channel and then claim your own infrastructure made it unreachable.There need to be mandatory minimum fines. Not the theoretical 4% of global revenue that only ever hits trillion-dollar companies. A flat minimum, say 5,000€ per violation, no matter how small the company, applied automatically when non-compliance is confirmed. No appeals on the fine itself, only on whether the violation occurred. Right now, the cost of ignoring a GDPR request from an individual is zero. That needs to change.Data protection offices need funding and accountability. An unanswered complaint is a failed complaint. If a regulatory body can't process reports in a reasonable timeframe, it's not regulating anything. There should be public reporting on resolution times and outcomes, so citizens can see whether their data protection office is actually functioning.Nobody cares, and that's the problemThe news occasionally reports that some S&P 100 company got fined a few million for a data protection violation, and everyone cheers. That's the visible part. The invisible part is millions of individuals whose requests get ignored, discarded, or lost in bureaucratic limbo with no recourse.Nobody checks whether companies actually comply. Nobody audits the small and mid-sized businesses. The enforcement agencies don't have the resources, and the EU doesn't seem interested in giving them more.I'm sure I'm not alone in this. I'm convinced that GDPR rights are being violated at a massive scale, every single day, by companies of every size. But unless there's a headline-worthy fine to collect from a company with a trillion-dollar valuation, nobody cares.The regulation exists. The enforcement doesn't.",

          "body_text": "Introducing Deno SandboxFebruary 3, 2026Ryan DahlProduct UpdateOver the past year, we’ve seen a shift in what Deno Deploy customers are\nbuilding: platforms where users generate code with LLMs, and that code runs\nimmediately without review. That code frequently calls LLMs itself, which means\nit needs API keys and network access.\nThis isn’t the traditional “run untrusted plugins” problem. It’s deeper:\nLLM-generated code, calling external APIs with real credentials, without human\nreview. Sandboxing the compute isn’t enough. You need to control network egress\nand protect secrets from exfiltration.\nDeno Sandbox provides both. And when the code is ready, you can deploy it\ndirectly to Deno Deploy without rebuilding.\nWatch the full announcement video here.\nSandboxes?\nYou don’t want to run untrusted code (generated by your LLMs, your users LLMs,\nor even hand written by users) directly on your server. It will compromise your\nsystem, steal your API keys, and call out to evil.com. You need isolation.\nDeno Sandbox gives you lightweight Linux microVMs (running in the Deno Deploy\ncloud) to run untrusted code with defense-in-depth security. You create or\nprogrammatically via our JavaScript or Python SDKs, and they boot in under a\nsecond. You can also interact with them via SSH, HTTP, or even open a VS Code\nwindow directly into the sandbox.\nimport { Sandbox } from \"@deno/sandbox\";\nawait using sandbox = await Sandbox.create();\nawait sandbox.sh`ls -lh /`;Secrets That Can’t Be Stolen\nBut there is more. In Deno Sandbox, secrets never enter the environment. Code\nsees only a placeholder:\nimport { Sandbox } from \"@deno/sandbox\";\nawait using sandbox = await Sandbox.create({\nsecrets: {\nOPENAI_API_KEY: {\nhosts: [\"api.openai.com\"],\nvalue: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,\n},\n},\n});\nawait sandbox.sh`echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`;\n// DENO_SECRET_PLACEHOLDER_b14043a2f578cba75ebe04791e8e2c7d4002fd0c1f825e19...The real key materializes only when the sandbox makes an outbound request to an\napproved host. If prompt-injected code tries to exfiltrate that placeholder to\nevil.com? Useless.\nNetwork Egress Control\nYou can also restrict which hosts the sandbox can talk to:\nawait using sandbox = await Sandbox.create({\nallowNet: [\"api.openai.com\", \"*.anthropic.com\"],\n});Any request to an unlisted host gets blocked at the VM boundary.\nBoth features are implemented via an outbound proxy similar to\ncoder/httpjail. This gives us a chokepoint\nfor policy enforcement. We plan to add more capabilities here: analytics for\noutbound connections and programmatic hooks for trusted code to inspect or\nmodify requests.\nIf you’re running untrusted JavaScript or TypeScript, combine this with Deno’s\n--allow-net flag for defense in depth: VM-level network restrictions plus\nruntime-level permissions.\nSandbox to Production\nsandbox.deploy() deploys code from your sandbox directly to Deno Deploy.\nconst build = await sandbox.deploy(\"my-app\", {\nproduction: true,\nbuild: { mode: \"none\", entrypoint: \"server.ts\" },\n});\nconst revision = await build.done;\nconsole.log(revision.url);One call to go from sandbox to production deployment. No rebuilding in a\ndifferent CI system, no re-authenticating with a different tool. Just turn your\ndev environment directly into a production ready, auto-scaling serverless\ndeployment.\nPersistence\nSandboxes are ephemeral by default, but when you need state we have you covered:\nVolumes: read-write storage for caches, databases, user data\nSnapshots: read-only images for pre-installed toolchains and volume base\nRun apt-get install once, snapshot it, and every future sandbox boots with\neverything already installed. Create read-write volumes from the snapshots to\ncreate a fresh development environment in seconds.\nTechnical Details\nSpec\nValue\nRegions\nAmsterdam, Chicago\nvCPUs\n2\nMemory\n768 MB - 4 GB\nLifetime\nEphemeral or timeout (supports extending on demand)\nMax lifetime\n30 minutes\nBoot time\n< 1 second\nPerfect for AI agents executing code, vibe-coding environments, secure plugin\nsystems, ephemeral CI runners, and customer-supplied code.\nPricing\nDeno Sandbox is included in your Deno Deploy plan with competitive, usage-based\npricing. You pay for compute time, not wall-clock time.\n$0.05/h CPU time (40h included with Pro)\n$0.016/GB-h memory (1000 GB-h included with Pro)\n$0.20/GiB-month volume storage (5 GiB included with Pro)\nSee full pricing details →\nEnterprise pricing available—contact deploy@deno.com.\nGet Started\nDeno Sandbox launches in beta today, alongside the\ngeneral availability of Deno Deploy.\nLanding page: deno.com/sandbox\nDocs: docs.deno.com/sandbox\nJavaScript SDK: jsr.io/@deno/sandbox or\nnpm\nPython SDK:\npypi.org/project/deno-sandbox\nWe’re excited to see what you (or your AI agents) build with Deno Sandbox.",

          "body_text": "221 Cannon is Not For SaleWritten byFredonFebruary 3, 2026Like most people, I’ve had my identity stolen once or twice in my life. It’s annoying, but thankfully I’ve avoided some of the more catastrophic outcomes when criminals begin impersonating you.These days, however, it seems like someone is really trying to change that: a scammer has now tried to impersonate me multiple times in a six figure land deal in my hometown of Wilton, CT. So while I usually use this blog to write about finding weird things on the internet, it’s now time for a story about something weird on the internet finding me.The story begins with my brother Alexander and I purchasing a small parcel of vacant land at 221 Cannon Road in Wilton, Connecticut in 2015. It’s been over 10 years since we purchased it and we have never listed it for sale. Nor do we have plans to sell it.And yet, three different real estate agents have now contacted us to let us know that someone has been impersonating us and attempting to sell our property out from under us.The first time it happened, it was pretty upsetting, but now that it’s happened another two times, I figured it was time to write a blog post about it.The First Attempt (March 2024)In March 2024, I received an email from a real estate attorney in Wilton, asking if I was the “Fred Benenson” who co-owned property in town with an “Ed Benenson.” He explained that a realtor at a major brokerage had been working with someone claiming to be us, and that there was already an offer on the table. The attorney was doing his due diligence before representing the sellers — and something didn’t add up.I replied within minutes: Neither of us had spoken to anyone about selling the property. It was pretty concerning.The realtor had been contacted through Zillow by someone claiming to be me. They’d had a phone conversation — she noted the person had a “middle European” accent — and the scammer had provided accurate details about the property, including its exact acreage. The impostor gave her the email address [email protected] and the phone number (516) 828-0305. He also provided a fake email for my brother: [email protected]. Notice the subtle misspelling — “Benenson” without the second “n” in the email, and the hyphenated “out-look.com” domain.She had walked the property, taken drone photos, pulled comps, and listed for a price well above what we paid for it. The property had been live on dozens of real estate websites for days before anyone caught it. A builder had already submitted a full-price cash offer.The scammer had even e-signed a purchase agreement.When the attorney requested identification before closing, the impostor provided a New York State driver’s license. It had my father’s name (which I share with him) and his correct date of birth and home address. But the photo was of a complete stranger.I have no idea who that guy is in on the license, but it’s definitely not my Dad. The license wouldn’t fool anyone who knew my father, but it didn’t need to – in a transaction conducted entirely by email and text message, with a closing that the scammer would never actually attend, the ID just needed to look plausible enough to keep things moving forward. (Though if you look closely at his signature, it’s clearly not written by hand.)How It Was CaughtThe attorney deserves most of the credit here. He told me this was the second time in nine months he’d encountered this exact scheme on vacant land in Wilton – his policy is that he won’t represent owners of vacant land without independently verifying ownership. That’s what led him to track me down, and that’s what stopped the sale.The realtor was an innocent victim in this too. She’d done her job by walking the property, pulling comps, etc., all in good faith. When I initially suggested (perhaps unfairly) that this felt like lead generation, the attorney took me aside and vouched for her. I’m glad I listened to him!I apologized to her, and she graciously forwarded me all of her text message exchanges with the scammer. Reading through them was fascinating. The impostor was responsive, polite, and generally knew the right things to say. But there were tells: slightly awkward phrasing (“Hi good morning”), declining a for-sale sign (“No I don’t think that will be necessary”), and a general reluctance to engage in any way that might require showing up in person.            Going to the FBIAfter gathering everything I could — the fake ID, the realtor’s text messages, the scammer’s email addresses and phone number, and the attorney’s notes from a prior similar case — I contacted the FBI field office in Connecticut. They directed me to “walk it in” to the office in New York City.The experience was, frankly, underwhelming. The FBI wouldn’t let me submit any of our documentation. Instead, they required me to write out the entire complaint by hand on a single piece of paper and hand it to the guard. He made some calls while I waited, and by the end he seemed at least somewhat interested. He gave me the standard line: 2-3 weeks if I hear from anyone.I never heard from anyone.The attorney, meanwhile, checked with his title company about recording an affidavit on the land records — something that would alert any future buyer or title searcher that the property had been targeted by fraud, and providing our verified contact information.It’s Happening Again (February 2026)I thought this was behind us. Then, this past week, nearly two years later, I was contacted by two more real estate agents, both reaching out to warn me that someone was once again trying to sell 221 Cannon Road.The first was a agent in Wilton who reached out via Instagram DM, of all places — it was the only way he could find to contact me. He explained that his team had received an inquiry to list 221 Cannon Road and had sent paperwork to “Fred and Alex” the night before to sign. But he’d done something smart: he’d noticed he had a mutual friend with my brother, and when he asked him about the situation, he flagged that the conversation with “Alex” didn’t sound right.“I had a really bad feeling it wasn’t,” he told me.The second agent, a woman at Berkshire Hathaway, sent a carefully worded email explaining that she’d been contacted by someone claiming to have authority to sell our property, but that “several standard verification steps raised concerns” and she chose not to proceed. She reached out purely as a courtesy to let us know.Which is about when I decided I should write something about this. Not only because it’s a fascinating scam that seems to be getting more common, but because I figured this post might show up for the next broker who might be doing research on the address.Vacant Land FraudThis type of scam targets a very specific vulnerability: vacant land has no occupants to notice a for-sale sign, no neighbors who’d immediately recognize something is wrong, and closings often happen remotely.Here’s how it works:The scammer identifies vacant land through public records or Zillow. They look for parcels that are owned free and clear (no mortgage), haven’t changed hands recently, and are in desirable areas.They contact a real estate agent through a platform like Zillow, posing as the owner. They know the property details because that information is publicly available.They communicate primarily through text and email, avoiding in-person meetings. They provide fake identification if asked.They agree to whatever price the agent suggests (because they don’t actually own the property, any sale is pure profit).They push for a quick closing and attempt to direct proceeds to an account they control.If questioned, they disappear. The scammer who targeted us in 2024 simply stopped responding once the attorney asked for an in-person closing.If they get farther they’ll pocket the earnest money deposit which would have been significant in my case.A similar scheme in nearby Fairfield wasn’t caught in time: someone had a $1.5 million home built on land they didn’t own without the actual owners knowing.What You Can DoIf you own vacant land there are a couple of things you can do, but the most effective one is probably to register the address with a Fraud / No-Authority notice. This involves calling the County Recorder / Register of Deeds and ask how to record one of these (names vary by state):    •    Owner Affidavit    •    Affidavit of Fact    •    Notice of Non-Authority to Convey    •    Fraud Alert / Title Alert Notice    •    Statement of Ownership / Anti-Fraud Notice:You could also setup up Google Alerts for your address and you’ll be notified if it appears online.Finally, and this certainly isn’t for everyone, you can make yourself easily findable online. One reason the attorney was able to verify ownership quickly in 2024 was that it’s fairly easy to gooogle me. If you own property, make sure there’s some way for a diligent attorney or agent to reach the real you.The Property Is Not For SaleIn case it isn’t clear, 221 Cannon Road is not for sale. It has never been for sale. If you are a real estate professional who has been contacted about listing or purchasing this property, please reach out to me directly.←SendGrid isn’t emailing you about ICE or BLM.

Soldiers in Austria are using open source office software to write reports after the military dropped Microsoft Office. Bureaucrats in a German state have also turned to free software for their administrative work. Around Europe, governments and institutions are seeking to reduce their use of digital services from U.S. Big Tech companies and turning to domestic or free alternatives. The push for “digital sovereignty” is gaining attention as the Trump administration strikes an increasingly belligerent posture toward the continent, highlighted by recent tensions over Greenland that intensified fears that Silicon Valley giants could be compelled to cut off access. Concerns about data privacy and worries that Europe is not doing enough to keep up with the United States and Chinese tech leadership are also fueling the drive.\nThe French government referenced some of these concerns when it announced last week that 2.5 million civil servants would stop using video conference tools from U.S. providers — including Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Webex and GoTo Meeting — by 2027 and switch to Visio, a homegrown service.\nRelated Stories\nBig Tech pulls Wall Street lower as gold and silver prices bounce higher\n3 MIN READ\nElon Musk joins his rocket and AI businesses into a single company\n3 MIN READ\nAfter a day of sharp swings, Wall Street ends nearly where it began\n3 MIN READ\nThe objective is “to put an end to the use of non-European solutions, to guarantee the security and confidentiality of public electronic communications by relying on a powerful and sovereign tool,” the announcement said.\n“We cannot risk having our scientific exchanges, our sensitive data, and our strategic innovations exposed to non-European actors,” David Amiel, a civil service minister, said in a press release.Microsoft said it continues to “partner closely with the government in France and respect the importance of security, privacy, and digital trust for public institutions.”The company said it is “focused on providing customers with greater choice, stronger data protection, and resilient cloud services — ensuring data stays in Europe, under European law, with robust security and privacy protections.”\nZoom, Webex and GoTo Meeting did not respond to requests for comment. French President Emmanuel Macron has been pushing digital sovereignty for years. But there’s now a lot more “political momentum behind this idea now that we need to de-risk from U.S. tech,” Nick Reiners, senior geotechnology analyst at the Eurasia Group. “It feels kind of like there’s a real zeitgeist shift,” Reiners saidIt was a hot topic at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting of global political and business elites last month in Davos, Switzerland. The European Commission’s official for tech sovereignty, Henna Virkkunen, told an audience that Europe’s reliance on others “can be weaponized against us.” “That’s why it’s so important that we are not dependent on one country or one company when it comes to very critical fields of our economy or society,” she said, without naming countries or companies. A decisive moment came last year when the Trump administration sanctioned the International Criminal Court’s top prosecutor after the tribunal, based in The Hague, Netherlands, issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, an ally of President Donald Trump.\nThe sanctions led Microsoft to cancel Khan’s ICC email, a move that was first reported by The Associated Press and sparked fears of a “kill switch” that Big Tech companies can use to turn off service at will. Microsoft maintains it kept in touch with the ICC “throughout the process that resulted in the disconnection of its sanctioned official from Microsoft services. At no point did Microsoft cease or suspend its services to the ICC.”Microsoft President Brad Smith has repeatedly sought to strengthen trans-Atlantic ties, the company’s press office said, and pointed to an interview he did last month with CNN in Davos in which he said that jobs, trade and investment. as well as security, would be affected by a rift over Greenland. “Europe is the American tech sector’s biggest market after the United States itself. It all depends on trust. Trust requires dialogue,” Smith said.\nOther incidents have added to the movement. There’s a growing sense that repeated EU efforts to rein in tech giants such as Google with blockbuster antitrust fines and sweeping digital rule books haven’t done much to curb their dominance.Billionaire Elon Musk is also a factor. Officials worry about relying on his Starlink satellite internet system for communications in Ukraine. Washington and Brussels wrangled for years over data transfer agreements, triggered by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden’s revelations of U.S. cyber-snooping. With online services now mainly hosted in the cloud through data centers, Europeans fear that their data is vulnerable. U.S. cloud providers have responded by setting up so-called “sovereign cloud” operations, with data centers located in European countries, owned by European entities and with physical and remote access only for staff who are European Union residents.\nThe idea is that “only Europeans can take decisions so that they can’t be coerced by the U.S.,” Reiners said. The German state of Schleswig-Holstein last year migrated 44,000 employee inboxes from Microsoft to an open source email program. It also switched from Microsoft’s SharePoint file sharing system to Nextcloud, an open source platform, and is even considering replacing Windows with Linux and telephones and videoconferencing with open source systems. “We want to become independent of large tech companies and ensure digital sovereignty,” Digitalization Minister Dirk Schrödter said in an October announcement. The French city of Lyon said last year that it’s deploying free office software to replace Microsoft. Denmark’s government and the cities of Copenhagen and Aarhus have also been trying out open-source software.“We must never make ourselves so dependent on so few that we can no longer act freely,” Digital Minister Caroline Stage Olsen wrote on LinkedIn last year. “Too much public digital infrastructure is currently tied up with very few foreign suppliers.”The Austrian military said it has also switched to LibreOffice, a software package with word processor, spreadsheet and presentation programs that mirrors Microsoft 365’s Word, Excel and PowerPoint. The Document Foundation, a nonprofit based in Germany that’s behind LibreOffice, said the military’s switch “reflects a growing demand for independence from single vendors.” Reports also said the military was concerned that Microsoft was moving file storage online to the cloud — the standard version of LibreOffice is not cloud-based. Some Italian cities and regions adopted the software years ago, said Italo Vignoli, a spokesman for The Document Foundation. Back then, the appeal was not needing to pay for software licenses. Now, it’s the main reason is to avoid being locked into a proprietary system. “At first, it was: we will save money and by the way, we will get freedom,” Vignoli said. “Today it is: we will be free and by the way, we will also save some money.”___Associated Press writer Molly Quell in The Hague, Netherlands contributed to this report. ___This version corrects the contribution line to Molly Quell instead of Molly Hague.\nKELVIN CHAN\nChan covers technology and innovation in Europe and beyond for The Associated Press.\ntwitter\nmailto",

prek safely.\nI'm new to pre-commit-style tools: learn the basics—creating a config, running hooks, and installing git hooks—in the beginner quickstart walkthrough.\nWhy prek?\nprek is faster\nIt is multiple times faster than pre-commit and takes up half the disk space.\nIt redesigned how hook environments and toolchains are managed, they are all shared between hooks, which reduces the disk space usage and speeds up the installation process.\nRepositories are cloned in parallel, and hooks are installed in parallel if their dependencies are disjoint.\nHooks can run in parallel by priority (hooks with the same priority may run concurrently), reducing end-to-end runtime.\nIt uses uv for creating Python virtualenvs and installing dependencies, which is known for its speed and efficiency.\nIt implements some common hooks in Rust, built in prek, which are faster than their Python counterparts.\nIt supports repo: builtin for offline, zero-setup hooks, which is not available in pre-commit.\nprek provides a better user experience\nNo need to install Python or any other runtime, just download a single binary.\nNo hassle with your Python version or virtual environments, prek automatically installs the required Python version and creates a virtual environment for you.\nBuilt-in support for workspaces (or monorepos), each subproject can have its own .pre-commit-config.yaml file.\nprek run has some nifty improvements over pre-commit run, such as:\nprek run --directory <dir> runs hooks for files in the specified directory, no need to use git ls-files -- <dir> | xargs pre-commit run --files anymore.\nprek run --last-commit runs hooks for files changed in the last commit.\nprek run [HOOK] [HOOK] selects and runs multiple hooks.\nprek list command lists all available hooks, their ids, and descriptions, providing a better overview of the configured hooks.\nprek auto-update supports --cooldown-days to mitigate open source supply chain attacks.\nprek provides shell completions for prek run <hook_id> command, making it easier to run specific hooks without remembering their ids.\nFor more detailed improvements prek offers, take a look at Difference from pre-commit.\nWho is using prek?\nprek is pretty new, but it is already being used or recommend by some projects and

They have also summoned billionaire owner Elon Musk for questioning.X and Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI also face intensifying scrutiny from Britain’s data privacy regulator, which opened formal investigations into how they handled personal data when they developed and deployed Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok. Grok, which was built by xAI and is available through X, sparked global outrage last month after it pumped out a torrent of sexualized nonconsensual deepfake images in response to requests from X users. The French investigation was opened in January last year by the prosecutors’ cybercrime unit, the Paris prosecutors’ office said in a statement. It’s looking into alleged “complicity” in possessing and spreading pornographic images of minors, sexually explicit deepfakes, denial of crimes against humanity and manipulation of an automated data processing system as part of an organized group, among other charges.\nProsecutors asked Musk and former CEO Linda Yaccarino to attend “voluntary interviews” on April 20. Employees of X have also been summoned that same week to be heard as witnesses, the statement said. Yaccarino was CEO from May 2023 until July 2025.\nRelated Stories\nElon Musk joins his rocket and AI businesses into a single company\n3 MIN READ\nUS-brokered talks on Russia’s war on Ukraine will resume in Abu Dhabi\n2 MIN READ\nIndonesia lets Elon Musk’s Grok back online under tight supervision\n1 MIN READ\nA spokesperson for X did not respond to multiple requests for comment. X’s lawyer in France, Kami Haeri, told The Associated Press: ″We are not making any comment at this stage.”\nIn a message posted on X, the Paris prosecutors’ office announced the ongoing searches at the company’s offices in France and said it was leaving the platform while calling on followers to join it on other social media.“At this stage, the conduct of the investigation is based on a constructive approach, with the aim of ultimately ensuring that the X platform complies with French law, as it operates on the national territory,” the prosecutors’ statement said.\nEuropean Union police agency Europol “is supporting the French authorities in this,” Europol spokesperson Jan Op Gen Oorth told the AP, without elaborating.French authorities opened their investigation after reports from a French lawmaker alleging that biased algorithms on X likely distorted the functioning of an automated data processing system.It expanded after Grok generated posts that allegedly denied the Holocaust, a crime in France, and spread sexually explicit deepfakes, the statement said. Grok wrote in a widely shared post in French that gas chambers at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp were designed for “disinfection with Zyklon B against typhus” rather than for mass murder — language long associated with Holocaust denial. In later posts on X, the chatbot reversed itself and acknowledged that its earlier reply was wrong, saying it had been deleted and pointed to historical evidence that Zyklon B was used to kill more than 1 million people in Auschwitz gas chambers.\nThe chatbot also appeared to praise Adolf Hitler last year, in comments that X took down after complaints.In Britain, the Information Commissioner’s Office said it’s looking into whether X and xAI followed the law when processing personal data and whether Grok had any measures in place to prevent its use to generate “harmful manipulated images.”“The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people’s personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,” said William Malcolm, an executive director at the watchdog.He didn’t specify what the penalty would be if the probe found the companies didn’t comply with data protection laws.A separate investigation into Grok launched last month by the U.K. media regulator, Ofcom, is ongoing. Ofcom said Tuesday it’s still gathering evidence and warned the probe could take months.\nX has also been under pressure from the EU. The 27-nation bloc’s executive arm opened an investigation last month after Grok spewed nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images on the platform. Brussels has already hit X with a 120-million euro (then-$140 million) fine for shortcomings under the bloc’s sweeping digital regulations, including blue checkmarks that broke the rules on “deceptive design practices” that risked exposing users to scams and manipulation.On Monday, Musk ’s space exploration and rocket business, SpaceX, announced that it acquired xAI in a deal that will also combine Grok, X and his satellite communication company Starlink.___Associated Press writers Nicolas Vaux-Montagny in Lyon, France, Mike Corder in The Hague, Netherlands, Sylvia Hui and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.\nSYLVIE CORBET\nCorbet is an Associated Press reporter based in Paris.

You get three chances to draft enough resources to survive. I designed my own slide rule to help with the mental multiplication - most of the fun of the game comes from the mechanics being slightly obscured from the player.Since I designed this slide rule myself, I was able to make a couple unconventional design choices that fit my needs. For instance, mine has three octaves so it can represent numbers within the ones, thousands, or millions' range, for example; no need to track arbitrary powers of ten. Since it's a rotary rule, it wraps around. Eg. 353×24 shows on the device as 8.47, so you can think of it as 8.47 thousand, for example.Holding a physical object in my hands while playing helps more than I thought it would. Should I take a card that increases chips by 600 or increases mult by 1.3×? Do I need to take a card to clear the blind in the short term, or do I have enough resources to draft a slower card that will scale better over time? Even just looking at how densely packed the marks are on the \"Chips\" side vs the \"Mult\" side of the device gives a visceral physical sense of what my build needs to focus on.Pictures and .STL: https://www.printables.com/model/1026662-jimbos-rotary-slide...Github repository: https://github.com/gcr/balatro-slide-ruleThe actual plotting code used Marimo notebooks, which host a python in your browser via WASM.

My grandfather was an aeronautical engineering / materials scientist for McDonnell Aircraft, and did a lot of foundational work on heat shields for early space flight (or so I am told). He was eventually named a McDonnell Douglas Fellow, back when there were fewer than 15 Fellows - the company, at the time, took out a full-page ad in Aerospace Magazine announcing it.I have his slide rule, that he used for ages. It's a mystery in a box to me - I have not the foggiest clue how it is used - but I cherish it.replyJohnFen 6 hours ago  | parent | next [–]\n> I have not the foggiest clue how it is used - but I cherish it.It's easier and more straightforward than you might expect.

In fact you should make a (YouTube?) video showing the slide rule and how to use it and your grandfather’s history to preserve this bit of history for your family and family’s future descendants.replyetrautmann 6 hours ago  | parent | prev | next [–]\nA key idea is that addition for logs is equivalent to multiplication.  To multiply two numbers you line them up on a log scale and then read out the sum, which is equivalent to the product. There is much more they can do but that was one aha moment when my dad showed me his.replysanjayjc 6 hours ago  | root | parent | next [–]\nI've never used a slide rule but recently developed an interest in them (and also in nomograms [1])My fascination stems from a belief: that slide rule usage helps users develop a certain intuition for numbers whereas the calculator doesn't. To illustrate, suppose someone tries to multiply 123 and 987 with a calculator but incorrectly punches in 123 and 187. My hypothesis is they'll look at the result but won't suspect any problem. The equivalent operation on a slide rule requires fewer physical actions and hence, is less error prone.Do you think there's anything to this hypothesis?[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28690298replyjonjacky 3 hours ago  | root | parent | next [–]\nWith a slide rule you always have to estimate the expected answer in your head before you begin any calculation.  So you develop a feel for how quantities scale with multiplication.With a slide rule you can only multiply the significant digits, not the magnitudes -- which you have to do in your head.   So you do exactly the same thing with the slide rule to multiply 123 and 987,  1.23 and 9.87,  and 1,230 and 9,870.  In all three cases, you get exactly the same answer: 121 or maybe just 120 (you only get 3 digits of precision at best).  You still have to multiply the powers of ten in your head, to get the answers 121,000, 12.1, and 12,100,000.I am just old enough to belong to the last generation of slide rule users.

In your examples, the slider of the slide rule must be moved to the left of the body of the rule. This means the number of digits left of the decimal point in the answer is the sum of the number of digits left of the decimal point in the two multiplicands.If the slider had been to the right of the body, the number of digits left of the decimal point in the answer is the sum of the number of digits left of the decimal point in the two multiplicands MINUS 1.\n.replyquotemstr 5 hours ago  | root | parent | prev | next [–]\n> nomogramsMe too!Nomograms are cool. They're little charts that let you compute a function physically, e.g. by lining up a ruler. A nomogram isn't a picture of a function: it is the function. If you're clever, you can make a nomogram that encodes complicated nonlinear mappings or even complex-valued relationships on a 2D plane.Occasionally nomograms are just better too: because they're continuous and analog, they can naturally express things digital logic people can do only awkwardly, just like Rust people can only awkward approximate things natural in Verilog (e.g. truly parallel CAM search).Nomograms are basically the tabletop gaming of math. Like a good tabletop game, a good nomogram requires a special kind of cleverness. Sure, coding something like Factorio is also hard: but it runs on a CPU. Something as rich and complex as Power Grid and High Frontier? Running on cardboard? Whole other level.I recall one tabletop two-player game that featured a single-player mode in which you played against an \"AI\" that you ran by hand by moving cardboard pieces around on a game-provided template under pseudocode-ish rules from the game manual. It's hard enough to code a decent game AI with all the resources of a CPU at your disposal. It's an OOM harder to do it when you're limited to physically-realized lookup tables, a literal handful of registers, and a scant few clock cycles of logic per turn.Coming full circle, some of these tabletop game \"AI\"s incorporate nomograms to help them fit their logic within the constraints.Example of a cool nomogram: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_chart. Smith charts let you compute complex (pun intended) relationships in RF signal processing with just a compass and straightedge.Also: part of the fun in making nomograms is that there's no general procedure you can follow to make a good one, just like there's no general compiler from computer game to tabletop game. They're art: specifically, one of those forms of art that, like architecture, has to meet functional requirements while tickling our aesthetic sense. It's kind of funny how when you optimize this kind of art for aesthetics under their functional constraints, you end up supercharging the functional part by side effect somehow.replyrealo 4 hours ago  | root | parent | prev | next [–]\nExactly. Using a slide rule shows how some complex operations in one domain can be made much easier in another.One you understand slide rules and logarithms, it is easier to understand convolutions in the FFT (frequency) domain...Almost like programming in APL, where you can solve a problem by expanding it in extra dimensions and getting the answer by re-compacting the complex object using a different view.replySheeple1 6 hours ago  | parent | prev | next [–]\nI had a similar experience!

          "body_text": "BlogAll PostsNewsPerformanceNetworkingTipsPrivacyAIMeet Bunny Database: the SQL service that just worksPosted by: Marek NalikowskiFebruary 3, 2026Don’t want to babysit your app database on a VM but not willing to pay the DBaaS tax either? We're building a third way.Today, we’re launching Bunny Database as a public preview: a SQLite-compatible managed service that spins down when idle, keeps latency low wherever your users are, and doesn’t cost a fortune.So what’s the deal with database services in 2026?It’s become clear by now that the DBaaS platforms that garnered the love of so many devs are all going upmarket. Removing or dumbing down free tiers, charging for unused capacity, charging extra for small features, or bundling them in higher tiers — you already know the drill.Hard to blame anyone for growing their business, but it doesn’t feel right when these services stop making sense for the very people who helped popularize them in the first place.So where does that leave you?Like SQLite, but for the webNot every project needs Postgres, and that’s okay. Sometimes you just want a simple, reliable database that you can spin up quickly and build on, without worrying it’ll hit your wallet like an EC2.That’s what we built Bunny Database for.What you get:One-click deployment: just name your database and go, no config neededLanguage-specific tooling: SDKs for TS/JS, Go, Rust, and .NET help you handle the boring bitsLow latency anywhere: replication regions let you serve reads close to your users41 regions worldwide: choose between automatic, single-region, and multi-region deploymentWorks over HTTP: wire up anything you’d likeDatabase editor: insert data or run queries on the spotMetrics: instant visibility into reads, writes, storage, and latencyAffordable, pay-as-you-go pricing: only pay for what you use, but without the serverless taxGet the full tour including how to connect Bunny Database to your app in this quick demo from our DX Engineer, Jamie Barton:\nWhy care about database latency anyway?You probably optimize the heck out of your frontend, APIs, and caching layers, all for the sake of delivering an experience that feels instant to your users. But when your database is far away from them, round-trip time starts to add noticeable latency.The usual fix is to introduce more caching layers, denormalized reads, or other workarounds. That’s obviously no fun.And when you think about it, devs end up doing this because the popular DBaaS platforms are usually either limited, complex, or too costly when it comes to multi-region deployments. So what looks like a caching problem is actually a data locality issue.OK, but how bad can it really be?To find out, we ran a read latency benchmark and measured p95 latency in Bunny Database.We picked a number of regions across the world and compared round-trip time for client locations ever farther away from the database in:a single-region setup,with replication regions enabled.Turns out serving reads close to clients reduced latency by up to 99%.Check out the full write-up on the benchmark setup and results here.While this definitely matters most to apps with global users, data locality does apply to everyone. With Bunny Database, you don’t have to stick to major data center locations and compensate with caching workarounds any more. Instead, you get a lot of flexibility to set up regions in an intuitive interface and it’s easy to switch things up as your requirements change.Choose between 3 deployment types when creating a database:Automatic region selection gives you one-click deployment with minimal latency. Bunny Database will select regions for you based on your IP address (you can check and tweak the selection in settings later).Single-region deployment lets you pick one of 41 regions available worldwide (check the full list here).Manual region selection gives you custom multi-region setup, where you can freely pick regions that make the most sense for your audience.All of this lets you start wherever you’d like and add regions as needed, without re-architecting your app.Usage-based pricing, but without the serverless taxIn the database world, capacity-based pricing gives you some predictability. But no one likes to pay for unused capacity, right?Serverless, on the other hand, is supposed to be cost-efficient, yet can rack up bills quickly, especially when the DBaaS charges significant markups on top of already pricey compute.We don’t do hyperscalers, though, so we can charge a fair price for Bunny Database in a usage-based model.Reads: $0.30 per billion rowsWrites: $0.30 per million rowsStorage: $0.10 per GB per active region (monthly)When not getting requests, Bunny Database only incurs storage costs. One primary region is charged continuously, while read replicas only add storage costs when serving traffic (metered by the hour)Your usage is charged continuously (pay-as-you-go) and invoiced monthlyDuring the public preview phase, Bunny Database is free.Wait, what does “SQLite-compatible” actually mean?Bunny Database wouldn’t be possible without libSQL, the open-source, open-contribution fork of SQLite created by Turso.We run Bunny Database on our own fork of libSQL, which gives us the freedom to integrate it tightly with the bunny.net platform and handle the infrastructure and orchestration needed to run it as a managed, multi-region service.What does this mean for Bunny Database’s upstream feature parity with libSQL and SQLite, respectively?The short answer is that we don’t currently promise automatic or complete feature parity with either upstream libSQL or the latest SQLite releases.While libSQL aims to stay compatible with SQLite’s API and file format, it doesn’t move in lockstep with upstream SQLite. We wouldn’t expect otherwise, especially as Turso has shifted focus from libSQL toward a long-term rewrite of SQLite in Rust.For Bunny Database, this means that compatibility today is defined by the libSQL version we’re built on, rather than by chasing every upstream SQLite or libSQL change as it lands. We haven’t pulled in any upstream changes yet, and we don’t currently treat upstream parity as an automatic goal.That’s intentional. Our focus so far has been on making Bunny Database reliable and easy to operate as a service. We think bringing in upstream changes only makes sense when they clearly improve real-world use cases, not just to tick a parity checkbox.If there are specific libSQL features you’d like to see exposed in Bunny Database, or recent SQLite features you’d want us to pull in, we’d love to hear about it. Join our Discord to discuss your use cases and help shape the roadmap!What’s ahead for Bunny DatabaseSpeaking of the roadmap, we don’t stop cooking. Here’s what’s coming up next:Automatic backupsDatabase file import/exportAuto-generated, schema-aware API with type-safe SDKsThere’s even more to come, but it’s too soon to spill the beans yet, especially while we’re in public preview. We’d love to hear your feedback, so we can shape what ships next together.More tools to build withBunny Database works standalone and fits right into your stack via the SDKs (or you can hook up anything using the HTTP API). But it also plays nicely with Bunny Edge Scripting and Bunny Magic Containers.To connect your database to an Edge Script or a Magic Containers app, simply go to the Access tab of the chosen database and click Generate Tokens to create new access credentials for it.Once they’re generated, you’ll get two paths to choose from:Click Add Secrets to an Edge Script and select the one you’d like to connect from the list. You’ll also need to import the libSQL TypeScript client and use the provided code snippet to connect it to your database.Click Add Secrets to Magic Container App and select the one you’d like to connect from the list. You’ll also need to connect to the database from your app using one of the client libraries or the HTTP API.After you complete the setup, the database URL and access token will be available as environment variables in your script or app. Use them to connect to your database:\nimport\n{\ncreateClient\n}\nfrom\n\"@libsql/client/web\";\nconst\nclient\n=\ncreateClient({\nurl:\nprocess.env.DB_URL,\nauthToken:\nprocess.env.DB_TOKEN\n});\nconst\nresult\n=\nclient.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users\");\nYou can find more detailed, step-by-step integration instructions in the docs:Connecting an Edge Script to Bunny DatabaseConnecting a Magic Containers app to Bunny DatabaseHop on boardWe can’t wait to see what you’ll build with Bunny Database and what you think of it. During the public preview phase, you get 50 databases per user account, each capped at 1 GB, but we hope this should be more than enough for lots of fun projects.Just sign in to the bunny.net dashboard to get started.

          "body_text": "X offices raided in France as UK opens fresh investigation into Grok8 hours agoShareSaveLiv McMahonTechnology reporterShareSaveGetty ImagesThe French offices of Elon Musk's X have been raided by the Paris prosecutor's cyber-crime unit, as part of an investigation into suspected offences including unlawful data extraction and complicity in the possession of child pornography.The prosecutor's office also said both Musk and former X chief executive Linda Yaccarino had been summoned to appear at hearings in April.In a separate development, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) announced a probe into Musk's AI tool, Grok, over its \"potential to produce harmful sexualised image and video content.\"Writing on X, Musk said the raid was a \"political attack\".X has previously characterised the French investigation as an attack on free speech.The investigation began in January 2025 when French prosecutors started looking into content recommended by X's algorithm, before being widened in July that year to include Musk's controversial AI chatbot, Grok.In a post at the time, X said the action was \"politically-motivated\" and denied allegations it had manipulated its algorithm.Following today's raid, French prosecutors say they are now investigating whether X has broken the law across multiple areas.Among potential crimes it said it would investigate were complicity in possession or organised distribution of images of children of a pornographic nature, infringement of people's image rights with sexual deepfakes and fraudulent data extraction by an organised group.New UK investigationMeanwhile, UK authorities have given an update on their investigations into sexual deepfakes created by Grok and shared on X.The images - often made using real images of women without their consent - prompted a barrage of criticism in January from victims, online safety campaigners and politicians.The company eventually intervened to prevent the practice, after Ofcom and others launched investigations.In an update on Tuesday, Ofcom said it was continuing to investigate the platform and was treating it as \"a matter of urgency\".But it added it was currently unable to investigate the creation of illegal images by Grok in this case because it did not have sufficient powers relating to chatbots.However, shortly afterwards the ICO said it was launching its own probe, in conjunction with Ofcom, into the processing of personal data in relation to the Grok.\"The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people's personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,\" said William Malcolm, the ICO's executive director for regulatory risk & innovation.In late January, the European Commission announced an investigation into its parent company xAI over concerns about the images.A Commission spokesperson said it was in touch with France over its search of X's office in Paris.'Not a free country'Pavel Durov - founder of the messaging app Telegram - criticised the French authorities on Tuesday, accusing France of being \"the only country in the world that is criminally persecuting all social networks that give people some degree of freedom\". \"Don't be mistaken: this is not a free country,\" he added in a post on X.Durov was arrested and detained in France in August 2024 over alleged moderation lapses on his messaging app, which the Paris prosecutor's office said had failed to curb criminal activity.He was permitted to leave the country last March after the platform made some changes to the way it operates following the arrest.These included sharing some user data with authorities in response to legal requests.Social mediaElon MuskTwitter",

          "body_text": "What’s up with all those equals signs anyway?For some reason or other, people have been posting a lot of excerpts from old emails on Twitter over the last few days.  The most vital question everybody’s asking themselves is: What’s up with all those equals signs?!And that’s something I’m somewhat of an expert on.  I mean, having written mail readers and stuff; not because I’ve been to Caribbean islands.I’ve seen people confidently claim that it’s a code, or that it’s an artefact of scanning and then using OCR, but it’s neither — it’s just that whoever converted these emails to a readable format were morons.What’s that you say?  “Converted?!  Surely emails are just text!!”  Well, if you lived in the stone age (i.e., the 80s), they mostly were, but then people invented things like “long lines” and “rock döts”, and computers had to “encode” the mail before sending.The artefact we see here is from something called “quoted printable”, or as we used to call it when it was introduced: “Quoted unreadable”.To take the first line.  Whoever wrote this, typed in the following in their mail reader:we talked about designing a pig with different non- cloven hoofs in order  to make kosher baconWe see that that’s quite a long line.  Mail servers don’t like that, so mail  software will break it into two lines, like so:we talked about designing a pig with different non- =\ncloven hoofs in order  to make kosher baconSee?  There’s that equals sign!  Yes, the equals sign is used to say “this should really be one single line, but I’ve broken it in two so that the mail server doesn’t get mad at me”.The formal definition here is important, though, so I have to be a bit technical here: To say “this is a continuation line”, you insert an equals sign, then a carriage return, and then a line feed.Or,=CRLFThree characters in total, i.e., :... non- =CRLF\ncloven hoofs...When displaying this, we remove all these three characters, and end up with:... non- cloven hoofs...So what’s happened here?  Well, whoever collected these emails first converted from CRLF (also known as the “Windows” line ending coding, but it’s the standard line ending in the SMTP standard) to “NL” (i.e., “Unix” line ending coding).  This is pretty normal if you want to deal with email.  But you then have one byte fewer:... non- =NL\ncloven hoofs...If your algorithm to decode this is, stupidly, “find equals signs at the end of the line, and then delete two characters, and then finally the equals sign”, you should end up with:... non- loven hoofs...I.e., you lose the “c”.  That’s almost what happened here, but not quite: Why does the equals sign still remain?This StackOverflow post from 14 years ago explains the phenomenon, sort of:Obviously the client notices that = is not followed by a proper CR LF sequence, so it assumes that it is not a soft line break, but a character encoded in two hex digits, therefore it reads the next two bytes. It should notice that the next two bytes are not valid hex digits, so its behavior is wrong too, but we have to admit that at that point it does not have a chance to display something useful. They opted for the garbage in, garbage out approach.That is, equals signs are also used for something else besides wrapping long lines, and that’s what we see later in the post:   =C2   please noteIf the equals sign is not at the end of a line, it’s used to encode “funny characters”, like what you use with “rock döts”.  =C2 is 194, which is a first character in a UTF-8 sequence, and the following char is most likely a =A0: =C2=A0 is “non-breakable space”, which is something people often use to indent text (and the “please note” is indented) and you see =A0 in many other places in these emails.My guess is that whoever did this part just did a search-replace for =C2 and/or =A0 instead of using a proper decoder, but other explanations are certainly possible.  Any ideas?Anyway, that’s what’s up with those equals signs:  1) “it’s technical”, and 2) “it’s a combination of buggy continuation line decoding and buggy non-ASCII decoding”, and 3) “whoever processed these mails are incompetent”.  I don’t think 2) should be very surprising at this point, do you?(Edit a bit later:  To nitpick a bit here: When the standard was written, people mostly envisioned that the quoted-printable content transport encoding would be unwound upon reception (note “transport”), and that you’d end up with “clean text” on disk after reception.  This didn’t really happen, so all “real” implementations do the right thing with single-character (i.e., “unencoded”) newlines.  For instance:(quoted-printable-decode-string \"he=\\nllo\")\n=> \"hello\"Which leads me to assume that they reused an algo that was usually run in an SMTP server context to do the line unfolding — in that context, you can safely assume that the line ending is a CRLF.  And by chance, this algo also works fine if you’re working with a Windows-based file, but fails for a Unix-based file.)Like this:Like Loading...Related Articles Posted on February 2, 2026February 3, 2026Author larsmagne23Categories computers",

          "body_text": "FLOPPINUX\nAn Embedded 🐧Linux on a Single 💾Floppy\n2025 Edition (v0.3.1)\nDecember 21, 2025 |\nback to home\nFLOPPINUX was released in 2021. After four years people find it\nhelpful. Because of that I decided to revisit FLOPPINUX in 2025 and make\nupdated tutorial. This brings bunch of updates like latest kernel and\npersistent storage.\nTable of Contents\nMain Project Goals\nLinux Kernel\n64-bit Base OS\nWorking Directory\nSystem Requirements\nKernel\nToolset\nFilesystem\nBoot Image\nFloppy Disk\nSummary\nDownload\nMain Project Goals\nThink of this as Linux From Scratch but for making single floppy\ndistribution.\nIt is meant to be a full workshop (tutorial) that you can follow\neasily and modify it to your needs. It is a learning exercise. Some base\nLinux knowledge is needed.\nThe final distribution is very simple and consists only of minimum of\ntools and hardware support. As a user you will be able to boot any PC\nwith a floppy drive to a Linux terminal, edit files, and create simple\nscripts. There is 264KB of space left for your newly created files.\nCore features:\nFully working distribution booting from the single floppy\nLatest* Linux kernel\nSupporting all 32-bit x86 CPUs since Intel 486DX\nHave a working text editor (Vi) and basic file manipulation commands\n(move, rename, delete, etc.)\nSupport for simple scripting\nPersistent storage on the floppy to actualy save files (264KB)\nWorks on real hardware and emulation\nMinimum Hardware\nRequirements:\nIntel 486DX 33MHz\n20MB RAM\nInternal floppy disk\nLinux Kernel\nThe Linux kernel drops i486 support in 6.15 (released May 2025), so\n6.14 (released March 2025) is the latest version with\nfull compatibility.\n64-bit Base OS\nThis time I will do everything on Omarchy Linux. It\nis 64-bit operating system based on Arch Linux. Instructions should work\non all POSIX systems. Only difference is getting needed packages.\nWorking Directory\nCreate directory where you will keep all the files.\nmkdir ~/my-linux-distro/\nBASE=~/my-linux-distro/\ncd $BASE\nHost OS Requirements\nYou need supporting software to build things. This exact list may\nvary depending on the system you have.\nInstall needed software/libs. On Arch/Omarchy 3.1:\nsudo pacman -S ncurses bc flex bison syslinux cpio\nCross-compiler:\nwget https://musl.cc/i486-linux-musl-cross.tgz\ntar xvf i486-linux-musl-cross.tgz\nrm i486-linux-musl-cross.tgz\nEmulation\n86Box is also good but slower. Bochs is the best but for debugging,\nnot needed here.\nFor emulation I will be using qemu.\nsudo pacman -S qemu-full\nKernel\nGet the sources for the latest compatible kernel\n6.14.11:\ngit clone --depth=1 --branch v6.14.11 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git\ncd linux\nNow, that you have them in linux/ directory lets\nconfigure and build our custom kernel. First create tiniest base\nconfiguration:\nmake ARCH=x86 tinyconfig\nThis is a bootstrap with absolute minimum features. Just enough to\nboot the system. We want a little bit more.\nAdd additonal config settings on top of it:\nmake ARCH=x86 menuconfig\nImportant: Do not uncheck anything in options unless specified so.\nSome of those options are important. You can uncheck but on your own\nrisk.\nFrom menus choose those options:\nGeneral Setup\nConfigure standard kernel features (expert users)\nEnable support for printk\nInitial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd)\nSupport initial ramdisk/ramfs compressed using XZ and\nuncheck everything else\nProcessor type and features\nx86 CPU resources control support\nProcessor family\n486DX\nEnable the block layer\nExecutable file formats\nKernel support for ELF binaries\nKernel support for scripts starting with #!\nDevice Drivers\nBlock devices\nNormal floppydisk support\nRAM block device support\nDefault number of RAM disk: 1\nCharacter devices\nEnable TTY\nFile systems\nDOS/FAT/EXFAT/NT Filesystems\nMSDOS fs support\nPseudo filesystems\n/proc file system support\nsysfs file system support\nNative language support\nCodepage 437\nLibrary routines\nXZ decompression and uncheck everything under\nit\nExit configuration (yes, save settings to .config).\nTime for compiling!\nCompile Kernel\nmake ARCH=x86 bzImage -j$(nproc)\nThis will take a while depending on the speed of your CPU. In the end\nthe kernel will be created in arch/x86/boot/ as\nbzImage file.\nMove kernel to our main directory and go\nback to it:\nmv arch/x86/boot/bzImage ../\ncd ..\nToolset\nWithout tools kernel will just boot and you will not be able to do\nanything. One of the most popular lightweight tools is BusyBox. It\nreplaces the standard GNU utilities with way smaller but still\nfunctional alternatives, perfect for embedded needs.\nGet the 1.36.1 version from busybox.net or Github\nmirror. Download the file, extract it, and change directory:\nRemember to be in the working directory.\nwget https://github.com/mirror/busybox/archive/refs/tags/1_36_1.tar.gz\ntar xzvf 1_36_1.tar.gz\nrm 1_36_1.tar.gz\ncd busybox-1_36_1/\nAs with kernel you need to create starting configuration:\nmake ARCH=x86 allnoconfig\nYou may skip this following fix if you are building on\nDebian/Fedora\nFix for Arch Linux based distributions:\nsed -i 's/main() {}/int main() {}/' scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/check-lxdialog.sh\nNow the fun part. You need to choose what tools you\nwant. Each menu entry will show how much more KB will be taken\nif you choose it. So choose it wisely :) For the first time use my\nselection.\nRun the configurator:\nmake ARCH=x86 menuconfig\nChoose the following options. Remember to do not\nuncheck anything if not stated here.\nSettings\nSupport files\n2GB\nBuild static binary (no shared libs)\nCoreutils\ncat\ncp\ndf\necho\nls\nmkdir\nmv\nrm\nsync\ntest\ntest as [\ntest as [[\nConsole Utilities\nclear\nEditors\nvi\nInit Utilities\ninit\nuncheck everything else (inside init: keep [*] only\non init in this page)\nLinux System Utilities\nmdev\nmount\nSupport lots of -o flags\nuncheck evrything else\numount\nMiscellaneous Utilities\nuncheck readahead\nShells\nChoose alias as (ash)\nash\nOptimize for size instead of speed\nAlias support\nNow exit with save config.\nCross Compiler Setup\nOur target system needs to be 32-bit. To compile it on 64-bit system\nwe need a cross compiler. You can setup this by hand in the menuconfig\nor just copy and paste those four lines.\nSetup paths:\nsed -i \"s|.*CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILER_PREFIX.*|CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILER_PREFIX=\\\"${BASE}/i486-linux-musl-cross/bin/i486-linux-musl-\\\"|\" .config\nsed -i \"s|.*CONFIG_SYSROOT.*|CONFIG_SYSROOT=\\\"${BASE}/i486-linux-musl-cross\\\"|\" .config\nsed -i \"s|.*CONFIG_EXTRA_CFLAGS.*|CONFIG_EXTRA_CFLAGS=-I$BASE/i486-linux-musl-cross/include|\" .config\nsed -i \"s|.*CONFIG_EXTRA_LDFLAGS.*|CONFIG_EXTRA_LDFLAGS=-L$BASE/i486-linux-musl-cross/lib|\" .config\nCompile BusyBox\nBuild tools and create base filesystem (“install”). It will ask for\noptions, just press enter for default for all of\nthem.\nmake ARCH=x86 -j$(nproc) && make ARCH=x86 install\nThis will create a filesystem with all the files at **_install/**.\nMove it to our main directory. I like to rename it to.\nLastly to to that new directory.\nmv _install ../filesystem\ncd ../filesystem\nFilesystem\nYou got kernel and basic tools but the system still needs some\nadditional directory structure.\nThis created minimum viable directory structure for satisfying the\nbasic requirements of a Linux system.\nRemember to be in the filesystem/ directory.\nmkdir -pv {dev,proc,etc/init.d,sys,tmp,home}\nsudo mknod dev/console c 5 1\nsudo mknod dev/null c 1 3\nNext step is to add minimum configuration files. First one is a\nwelcome message that will be shown after booting.\nHere is the first real opportunity to go wild and make this your own\nsignature.\ncat >> welcome << EOF\nYour welome message or ASCII art.\nEOF\nOr download my welcome file.\nwget https://krzysztofjankowski.com/floppinux/downloads/0.3.1/welcome\nIt looks like that:\n$ cat welcome\n_________________\n/_/ FLOPPINUX  /_/;\n/ ' boot disk  ' //\n/ '------------' //\n/   .--------.   //\n/   /         /  //\n.___/_________/__//   1440KiB\n'===\\_________\\=='   3.5\"\n_______FLOPPINUX_V_0.3.1 __________________________________\n_______AN_EMBEDDED_SINGLE_FLOPPY_LINUX_DISTRIBUTION _______\n_______BY_KRZYSZTOF_KRYSTIAN_JANKOWSKI ____________________\n_______2025.12 ____________________________________________\nBack to serious stuff. Inittab tells the system what to do in\ncritical states like starting, exiting and restarting.

          "body_text": "Coding assistants are solving the wrong problem Why we need bots that elicit good discussions, not just write better code 2026-02-02 The jury is out on the effectiveness of AI use in production, and it is not a pretty picture. Teams using AI completed 21% more tasks, yet company-wide delivery metrics showed no improvement (Index.dev, 2025) Experienced developers were 19% slower when using AI coding assistants—yet believed they were faster (METR, 2025) 48% of AI-generated code contains security vulnerabilities (Apiiro, 2024) To understand why, we have to take a closer look at the day-to-day software development. Consider this point raised in a colorful exchange on r/ExperiencedDev: A developers’ job is to reduce ambiguity. We take the business need and outline its logic precisely so a machine can execute. The act of writing the code is the easy part. Odds are, you aren’t creating perfect code specs into tickets, even with meeting notes, because developers will encounter edge cases that demand clarification over the course of implementation… There are two key points raised in this comment. Firstly, coding assistants require clearly-defined requirements in order to perform well. Secondly, edge cases and product gaps are often discovered over the course of implementation. These two facts come head-to-head in the application of coding agents to complex codebases. Unlike their human counterparts who would and escalate a requirements gap to product when necessary, coding assistants are notorious for burying those requirement gaps within hundreds of lines of code, leading to breaking changes and unmaintainable code. As a result, more overhead is spent on downstream code reviews (Index.dev, 2025) and fire-patching security vulnerabilities (Apiiro, 2025). In other words, the use of AI in production settings often increases ambiguity and reduces code reliability, directly contradicting the objective of developers. The picture is not without optimism. Some experienced engineers report transformative results: one principal engineer at Google claimed AI “generated what we built last year in an hour”; Boris Cherny, creator of Claude Code, described a month where he “didn’t open an IDE at all” while the model “wrote around 200 PRs, every single line.” The optimistic case is that developers evolve from coders into product engineers, focusing on architecture and product thinking while AI handles implementation. This however reflects the experience of seasoned developers who have both the technical depth to review AI output critically and the autonomy within their organizations to straddle product and engineering. For much of the software engineering workforce, the junior and mid-level engineers at banks, healthcare, and government agencies, there’s much less wiggle room. They are sandwiched between the unreliability of AI output and the increased expectation from management to ship faster, resulting in a rapidly widening empathy gap between developers and product owners.  The product context often goes through multiple layers (end users -> marketers -> product managers) before landing on their lap, necessitated by the separation of responsibilities within an organization and the unique demands of their industries. The effective use of coding agents may require a level of team coordination that simply does not justify the gains in technical output. But what if we have simply been approaching the problem from the wrong angle? Suppose we tackle the pain points of software development from first principles, can we come up with solutions that organically decrease ambiguity and reliably increase engineering velocity in production? Consider how developers spend their time (IDC, 2024):  Only 16% of a developer’s time goes to writing code. The rest? Security and code reviews, monitoring, deployments, requirements clarification—operational work that keeps the lights on but doesn’t ship features. Here’s the irony: AI coding assistants save developers roughly 10 hours per week, but the increase in inefficiencies in the other parts of the development lifecycle almost entirely cancelled out such gains (Atlassian, 2025). Here’s a comment from the earlier cited Redditor. They produce legitimate-looking code, and if no one has had the experience of thinking through the assumptions and then writing them into code - considering the edge cases- it’ll be lgtm’d and shipped. You’re shifting the burden of this feedback cycle to the right, after the code is output, and that makes us worse off since code is tougher to read than write. There’s a name for misalignment between business intent and codebase implementation: technical debt. The use of coding agents without careful delineation of their scope and responsibilities is threatening to accelerate tech debt accumulation. Hammering AI code generation on existing codebases doesn’t solve the problem, because contrary to what the label “tech debt” may suggest, most tech debt isn’t actually created in the code, it’s created in product meetings. Deadlines. Scope cuts. “Ship now, optimize later.” Those decisions shape the system, but the reasoning rarely makes it into the code. [Engineers] occasionally have access to complete data; at other times, they must work with limited information. They might be conscious of uncertainties surrounding their evidence, but frequently they are not. Competing social, financial, and strategic priorities influence the tradeoffs in unexpected ways. — Rios et al., 2024 How can we make this context-sharing and decision-making process less chaotic? We surveyed developers across different roles and team sizes regarding their product-engineering handoff process. The results were overwhelming: the majority discover unexpected codebase constraints weekly, after already committing to a product direction and the corresponding architectural implementation. When asked what would help most, two themes dominated: Reducing ambiguity upstream so engineers aren’t blocked waiting on product clarification mid-implementation A clearer picture of affected services and edge cases to allow for more precise feature scoping and time allocation When asked which engineering context would be most valuable to surface during product discussions, three categories stood out: state machine gaps (unhandled states caused by user interaction sequences), data flow gaps, and downstream service impacts.   Identifying how feature updates affect existing architectures and data flow is rated most desirable among engineering contexts to be surfaced after a product meeting. This aligns with decades of SDLC research showing that the costliest defects stem from misalignment between requirements and architecture, and such gaps often go unnoticed until it is too late. Luckily, the advancement of coding LLMs works in our favor here. Whereas generating fully-functional code through natural language prompting is prone to errors due to the aforementioned context problem, the reverse process, mapping out existing code structures and inferring how they may be impacted by a specific requirement, is much more tenable with recent models. From this vantage point, the possibilities to improving the developmental lifecycle is endless. Some suggested real-time display of engineering context during a meeting to help steer discussions; Others requested a code review bot that detects the discrepencacy of code implementation with stated product/business requirements. All-in-all, developers are eager to try out new tools that augment the existing way of doing things, provided they retain flexibility over when such tools are deployed. There is also little reservation against having longer but more fruitful product meetings: it is the difficulty conveying blockers that is the source of frustration. At Bicameral, we are committed to taking this pragmatic approach to alleviating software development pains, and move beyond lab benchmarks to investigate the most effective way to deploy AI in the wild. Our thesis is that LLMs could be a huge boon both for the industry and for individual developers—channeling the unrivaled human capacity to operate under uncertainty and adapt—provided the technology is developed with human needs in mind. If you’re a developer, we want to learn which types of context hurt most when they’re missing from discussion, based on your unique experience.

The proof is in our hair                  Researchers analyzed samples of Utahns' hair going back a century to document a 100-fold decrease in lead concentrations.\nBrian Maffly - research communication specialist\nPrior to the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, Americans lived in communities awash with lead from industrial sources, paint, water supply pipes and, most significantly, tailpipe emissions. A dangerous neurotoxin that accumulates in human tissues and is linked to developmental deficits in children, environmental lead levels have come way down in the years since, and so have human exposures.\nThe proof is in your hair.\nAn analysis of hair samples conducted by University of Utah scientists shows precipitous reductions in lead levels since 1916.\n“We were able to show through our hair samples what the lead concentrations are before and after the establishment of regulations by the EPA,” said demographer Ken Smith, a distinguished professor emeritus of family and consumer studies. “We have hair samples spanning about 100 years. And back when the regulations were absent, the lead levels were about 100 times higher than they are after the regulations.”\nA useful element with a dark side\nThe findings, which appear in PNAS, underscore the vital role of environmental regulations in protecting public health. The study notes lead rules are now being weakened by the Trump administration in a wide-ranging move to ease environmental protections.\n“We should not forget the lessons of history. And the lesson is those regulations have been very important,” said co-author Thure Cerling, a distinguished professor of both geology and biology. “Sometimes they seem onerous and mean that industry can’t do exactly what they’d like to do when they want to do it or as quickly as they want to do it. But it’s had really, really positive effects.”\nLead is the heaviest of heavy metals that, like mercury and arsenic, accumulate in living tissue and are toxic at even low levels. Yet lead holds very useful properties, great for fashioning into pipes and as a chemical additive. Lead was added to paint to improve durability, speed up drying, and produce vibrant colors with greater coverage. Lead also improved the performance of automobile engines by preventing pistons from “knocking.”\nBy the 1970s, its toxicity became well established, and EPA regulations began phasing it out of paint, pipes, gasoline and other consumer products.\nHow Utahns’ affection for family history advances science\nTo document whether these steps were helping reduce lead exposure in people, Smith joined with geologist Diego Fernandez and Cerling, who had developed techniques to discern where animals have lived and what they eat based on chemical analysis of hair and teeth.\nThe lead research is built on a previous study funded by the university’s Center on Aging and the National Institutes of Health that had recruited Utahns who consented to provide blood samples and family health histories.\nThe U.S. Mining and Smelting Co. plant in Midvale, Utah, 1906. Photo used by permission, Utah Historical Society.\nFor the new study, the researchers asked members of that cohort to provide hair samples, both contemporary and from when they were young. These people obliged, and some were able to find ancestors’ hair preserved in family scrapbooks dating as far back as a century. In all, the team acquired hair samples from 48 individuals in this manner, offering a robust window into lead levels along Utah’s populous Wasatch Front, which historically experienced heavy lead emissions from industrial sources.\n“The Utah part of this is so interesting because of the way people keep track of their family history. I don’t know that you could do this in New York or Florida,” said Smith, who directed the U’s Pedigree and Population Program at the Huntsman Cancer Center while these studies were conducted.\nThis region supported a vibrant smelting industry through most of the 20th century, centered in the cities of Midvale and Murray. Most of Utah’s smelters were shuttered by the 1970s, around the same time the EPA clamped down on the use of lead in consumer products.\nThe research team ran the hair samples through mass spectrometry equipment at the facility directed by Fernandez.\n“The surface of the hair is special. We can tell that some elements get concentrated and accumulated on the surface. Lead is one of those. That makes it easier because lead is not lost over time,” said Fernandez, a research professor in the Department of Geology & Geophysics. “Because mass spectrometry is very sensitive, we can do it with one hair strand, though we cannot tell where the lead is in the hair. It’s probably on the surface mostly, but it could also be coming from the blood if that hair was synthesized when there was high lead in the blood.”\nBlood would provide a better exposure assessment, but hair is far easier to collect and preserve, and more importantly, it offers clues to long-ago exposures for a person who has grown up or even deceased.\n“It doesn’t really record that internal blood concentration that your brain is seeing, but it tells you about that overall environmental exposure,” Cerling said. “One of the things that we found is that hair records that original value, but then the longer the hair has been exposed to the environment, the higher the lead concentrations are.”\nThe team’s findings regarding lead in hair run parallel to the reductions of lead in gasoline following the EPA’s establishment by President Richard Nixon.\nPrior to 1970, for example, gasolines contained about 2 grams of lead per gallon. That might not sound like much, but considering the billions of gallons of fuel American automobiles burn each year, it adds up to nearly 2 pounds of lead released into the environment per person a year.\n‘It’s an enormous amount of lead that’s being put into the environment and quite locally,” Cerling said. “It’s just coming out of the tailpipe, goes up in the air and then it comes down. It’s in the air for a number of days, especially during the inversions that we have and it absorbs into your hair, you breathe it and it goes into your lungs.”\nBut after the 1970s, even as gasoline consumption escalated in the United States, the concentrations of lead in the hair samples plummeted, from as high as 100 parts per million (ppm) to 10 ppm by 1990. In 2024, the level was less than 1 ppm.\nThe study, titled “Lead in archived hair documents decline in human lead (Pb) exposure since establishment of the US Environmental Protection Agency,” was published Feb. 2 in PNAS, or Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Support came from the Huntsman Cancer Foundation and the National Cancer Institute through a grant to the Utah Population Database and the University of Utah.\nMEDIA & PR CONTACTS\nBrian Maffly\nScience writer, University of Utah Communications\n801-573-2382\nbrian.maffly@utah.edu\nPosted in Health & Medicine, Impact Initiatives, Latest Stories, ResearchTagged Brian Maffly, Diego Fernandez, environmental regulation, EPA, hair, heavy metals, Ken Smith, lead, public health, Thure Cerling, toxic exposure, Utah Population Database",

These are more specialized processors, compared to the CPUs Intel traditionally produces, and are used for gaming and tasks like training artificial intelligence models.\nTechCrunch reached out to Intel for more information.\nThe project will be overseen by Kevork Kechichian, the executive vice president and general manager of Intel’s data center group, according to reporting from Reuters. Kechichian was hired in September among a slew of new engineer-focused hires.\nIntel also hired Eric Demmers for the effort in January. Demmers was previously at Qualcomm for more than 13 years, most recently serving as a senior vice president of engineering.\nThis initiative seems to be in relatively early stages as Tan said the company plans to develop its strategy around customer demands and needs.\nWhile Nvidia didn’t invent the GPU, that specific kind of chip has played a large role in its success. Its GPUs for AI systems are so advanced and popular, the chipmaker currently holds a commanding market lead.\nTechcrunch event\nTechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live\nOn June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

          "body_text": "The Department of Homeland Security has been quietly demanding tech companies turn over user information about critics of the Trump administration, according to reports.\nIn several cases over recent months, Homeland Security has relied on the use of administrative subpoenas to seek identifiable information about individuals who run anonymous Instagram accounts, which share posts about ICE immigration raids in their local neighborhoods. These subpoenas have also been used to demand information about people who have criticized Trump officials or protested government policies.\nUnlike judicial subpoenas, which are authorized by a judge after seeing enough evidence of a crime to authorize a search or seizure of someone’s things, administrative subpoenas are issued by federal agencies, allowing investigators to seek a wealth of information about individuals from tech and phone companies without a judge’s oversight.\nWhile administrative subpoenas cannot be used to obtain the contents of a person’s emails, online searches, or location data, they can demand information specifically about the user, such as what time a user logs in, from where, using which devices, and revealing the email addresses and other identifiable information about who opened an online account. But because administrative subpoenas are not backed by a judge’s authority or a court’s order, it’s largely up to a company whether to give over any data to the requesting government agency.\nAdministrative subpoenas are not new; the use of these self-signed demands by Trump officials to seek identifiable information about people who are critical of the president’s policies has raised alarm.\nBloomberg reported last week that Homeland Security sought the identity of an anonymous Instagram account called @montocowatch, which says its goal is to share resources to help protect immigrant rights and due process across Montgomery County in Pennsylvania. This comes amid an ongoing federal immigration crackdown across the United States, which has drawn widespread protests and condemnation. Homeland Security lawyers sent an administrative subpoena to Meta demanding it turn over personal information of the person who runs the account, citing a non-Homeland Security employee who claimed to receive a tip that ICE agents were being stalked.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, representing the account owner, said there was no evidence of wrongdoing and that recording police, sharing that recording, and doing so anonymously is legal and protected under the First Amendment. Homeland Security withdrew its subpoena without providing an explanation.\nTechcrunch event\nTechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live\nOn June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Those subpoenas were also withdrawn after the account owners sued to block the attempt.\nTech companies have in recent years published transparency reports that detail how many government demands for data they receive. But most do not break out how many judicial and administrative subpoenas they receive over a period of time, even though the two kinds of demands are fundamentally different.\nWhen asked by TechCrunch, Meta spokesperson Francis Brennan did not say if Meta provided Homeland Security any data involving @montcowatch or if the company was asked to provide information about the account another way.\nA new report by The Washington Post on Tuesday found that an administrative subpoena was also used to seek information from Google about an American retiree within hours of him after sending a critical email to Homeland Security’s lead attorney Joseph Dernbach. The retiree’s home was later visited by federal agents inquiring about the email.\nThe Post described the retiree as someone critical of Trump during his first term, who attended a No Kings rally last year, regularly attends gatherings and protests, and wrote criticisms to lawmakers, all actions protected under the First Amendment.\nWithin five hours of emailing the Homeland Security lawyer — who was named in an article about the case of an Afghan the U.S. was trying to deport and whose email address is listed on the Florida Bar’s website — the retiree received an email from Google, according to The Washington Post. The email notified him that his account had been subpoenaed by the Department of Homeland Security.\nThe subpoena demanded to know the day, time, and duration of all his online sessions, his IP address and physical address, and a list of each service he used, and any other usernames and identifiable information relating to his account, such as his credit card, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers.\nTwo weeks later, Homeland Security agents were on his doorstep, asking him questions about the email that he sent to Dernbach, which the agents conceded broke no laws.\nGoogle spokesperson Katelin Jabbari told TechCrunch the company pushes back against overbroad or improper subpoenas, “as we did in this instance,” referring to the subpoena referenced in The Washington Post’s reporting.\nWhen asked by TechCrunch, Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin would not say why the U.S. was seeking information about people who have been critical of the Trump administration and accounts documenting ICE activity, or say for what reason the subpoenas were withdrawn.\n“HSI has broad administrative subpoena authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(d) and 19 U.S.C. § 1509(a)(1) to issue subpoenas,” said McLaughlin, referring to Homeland Security Investigations, an investigative unit within ICE.\nNot all companies are able to hand over data about their customers. For instance, information that is end-to-end encrypted and can only be accessed by obtaining a person’s phone or devices. That said, many companies are still able to provide large amounts of information about their users, including where they log in, how they log in, and from where, which may allow investigators to unmask anonymous accounts.\nEnd-to-end encrypted messaging apps, like Signal, have long championed how little data it collects about its users. The messaging app responds to occasional legal demands by stating that it is unable to produce user data that it does not have to begin with.\nThe reliance on U.S. tech giants is another reason why European countries and ordinary consumers are seeking to rely less on American tech giants, at a time when chief executives and senior leaders at some of the largest U.S. tech companies are overtly cozying up to the Trump administration.\nTopics\nDepartment of Homeland Security, Security, Trump Administration\nZack Whittaker\nSecurity Editor\nZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

The capital will also be used to integrate its operating system, known as SkyOS, across numerous aircraft, including U.S. military Black Hawk helicopters.\nOther investors in this round include Fidelity Management & Research Company, ArrowMark Partners, Atreides Management LP, BAM Elevate, Baron Capital Group, Durable Capital Partners, Positive Sum, Qatar Investment Authority, RCM Private Markets Fund managed by Rokos Capital Management, and Woodline Partners. The startup, which was founded in 2016, has raised more than $605 million in equity capital.\nImage Credits:Skyryse\nSkyryse has made inroads with investors as well as the U.S. military, emergency medical service operators, law enforcement, and private operators for its simplified flight system. The startup has stripped out dozens of mechanical flight controls like gauges and switches and replaced them with a system containing several flight computers that automate the more complicated and dangerous aspects of flying.\nThis is not a fully autonomous system; a pilot must still handle the operations. But it’s designed to automate the trickiest aspects of flying, enhance the skills of pilots, and improve safety.\nThat simplicity and ease of operation — a literal swipe of the finger on a touchscreen — has won over companies like United Rotorcraft, Air Methods, and Mitsubishi Corporation, which have contracts with Skyryse to integrate SkyOS on a variety of helicopters and airplanes.\nSkyryse started building and testing its system on helicopters, one of the most unstable aircraft to operate. But the idea is that SkyOS can be applied to any aircraft. That initial operating system, known as Skyryse One, automates takeoff and landing and fully automates hover and engine-out emergency landings. The company has since integrated the operating system on Black Hawk helicopters.\nTechcrunch event\nTechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live\nOn June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

          "body_text": "Apple is bringing agentic coding to Xcode. On Tuesday, the company announced the release of Xcode 26.3, which will allow developers to use agentic tools, including Anthropic’s Claude Agent and OpenAI’s Codex, directly in Apple’s official app development suite.\nThe Xcode 26.3 Release Candidate is available to all Apple Developers today from the developer website and will hit the App Store a bit later.\nThis latest update comes on the heels of the Xcode 26 release last year, which introduced support for ChatGPT and Claude within Apple’s integrated development environment (IDE) used by those building apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple’s other hardware platforms.\nThe integration of agentic coding tools allows AI models to tap into more of Xcode’s features to perform their tasks and perform more complex automation.\nThe models will also have access to Apple’s current developer documentation to ensure they use the latest APIs and follow the best practices as they build.\nAt launch, the agents can help developers explore their project, understand its structure and metadata, then build the project and run tests to see if there are any errors and fix them, if so.\nImage Credits:Apple\nTo prepare for this launch, Apple said it worked closely with both Anthropic and OpenAI to design the new experience. Specifically, the company said it did a lot of work to optimize token usage and tool calling, so the agents would run efficiently in Xcode.\nXcode leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) to expose its capabilities to the agents and connect them with its tools. That means that Xcode can now work with any outside MCP-compatible agent for things like project discovery, changes, file management, previews and snippets, and accessing the latest documentation.\nDevelopers who want to try the agentic coding feature should first download the agents they want to use from Xcode’s settings. They can also connect their accounts with the AI providers by signing in or adding their API key. A drop-down menu within the app allows developers to choose which version of the model they want to use (e.g. GPT-5.2-Codex vs. GPT-5.1 mini).\nIn a prompt box on the left side of the screen, developers can tell the agent what sort of project they want to build or change to the code they want to make using natural language commands. For instance, they could direct Xcode to add a feature to their app that uses one of Apple’s provided frameworks, and how it should appear and function.\nImage Credits:Apple\nAs the agent starts working, it breaks down tasks into smaller steps, so it’s easy to see what’s happening and how the code is changing. It will also look for the documentation it needs before it begins coding. The changes are highlighted visually within the code, and the project transcript on the side of the screen allows developers to learn what’s happening under the hood.\nThis transparency could particularly help new developers who are learning to code, Apple believes. To that end, the company is hosting a “code-along” workshop on Thursday on its developer site, where users can watch and learn how to use agentic coding tools as they code along in real time with their own copy of Xcode.\nAt the end of its process, the AI agent verifies that the code it created works as expected. Armed with the results of its tests on this front, the agent can iterate further on the project if need be to fix errors or other problems. (Apple noted that asking the agent to think through its plans before writing code can sometimes help to improve the process, as it forces the agent to do some pre-planning.)\nPlus, if developers are not happy with the results, they can easily revert their code back to its original at any point in time, as Xcode creates milestones every time the agent makes a change.\nTopics\nagentic, AI, Apple, Apps, coding, developers, xcode\nSarah Perez\nConsumer News Editor\nSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

          "body_text": "New York City and others like it are filled with old buildings that are for the most part fine, except they’re not all that comfortable to live in. Built in an era when massive boilers were cutting-edge technology, the buildings are usually too hot or too cold, but seldom just right.\nThere are companies trying to rectify that using clever horseshoe-shaped heat pumps. Superficially, they’re similar to window air conditioners, except they don’t block the view and they can heat as well as cool.\nGradient makes one of those heat pumps, but now it’s adding a twist: In multifamily buildings, it can link every one of its window units together. The startup shared with TechCrunch exclusive details about the new Nexus software and service.\n“Multifamily buildings are an ignored sector,” Vince Romanin, chief technology officer at Gradient, told TechCrunch. “It’s a place where we can do better for the user.”\nThe startup is mostly targeting old buildings that need HVAC upgrades. Gradient has worked with the New York City Housing Authority to install its heat pumps in public housing, and it ran a pilot in Tracy, California, in a newer two-story affordable-housing complex. It’s also talking with colleges and universities, many of which have dorms that weren’t built with hot autumn weather in mind.\nOld buildings often have one electric meter, which can tempt residents into overusing their heating or air conditioning. Nexus gives some control back to building managers. They can set guardrails to prevent people from overusing the heat or AC — either intentionally or otherwise — while still allowing them to be comfortable. In one instance, a building manager set the heating limit at 78˚ F, and the next day energy consumption dropped by a quarter.\nRomanin said Gradient’s heat pumps are the “lowest-cost option” for old buildings with boilers that are reaching end of life, a common occurrence in New York City. As a bonus, units that previously only had a steam radiator now get air conditioning, future proofing the units against worsening heat waves.\nTechcrunch event\nTechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live\nOn June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

In buildings with old electrical wiring that can’t support a full 12 amp load on a single outlet, Nexus can reduce the draw, said Mansi Shah, senior vice president of product and software at Gradient.\nThat strategy can extend beyond the building too. When the grid is overwhelmed by demand, which can happen on hot summer days, Gradient is working on a way to dial back its heat pumps while still maintaining occupant comfort. By using information about the building along with feedback from sensors in the heat pumps, the company hopes to predict which units can reduce their air conditioning demand, like those on the shady side of a building. That sort of demand response can help the grid serve more heat pumps without requiring costly upgrades.\n“There’s a lot of people who said when we electrify everything, the grid won’t handle it,” Romanin said. “I think that it is very possible to electrify everything and make the grid better, make the grid’s job easier, and make electrons cheaper.”\nTopics\nair conditioning, Climate, Exclusive, heat pumps, hvac, Startups\nTim De Chant\nSenior Reporter, Climate\nTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

          "body_text": "Henry Soong is trying to make vertical microdrama series that don’t suck. That makes the Watch Club founder quite unique within this multibillion-dollar industry of apps that churn out formulaic, cringe-worthy content and use aggressive tactics to maximize in-app spending.\n“Ninety percent of these stories are, ‘I’m a poor girl! I fell in love with a secret billionaire! He’s a werewolf, and his mother is a vampire, and she disapproves of me!’” Soong told TechCrunch. “There’s a market for that, and we shouldn’t laugh at that, but I think this can be so much bigger than just sloppy, AI-adjacent romance soap operas.”\nSoong’s comments are a little combative, but they’re not wrong. Competitor ReelShort made $1.2 billion in in-app purchases last year, while DramaBox made $276 million. The quality, he said, is so milquetoast that it could feasibly be made using AI-generated scripts.\nWhat would be the earning potential for a microdrama app that makes shows that are actually good and worth talking about?\nSoong is trying to answer that question with Watch Club, an app with microdrama stories made by SAG and WGA actors and writers (leading apps like DramaBox and ReelShort do not use union talent).\nSoong, a former Meta product manager who describes himself as “a fangirl, through and through,” thinks that what makes TV so special is the communities that form around them. Given his experience working on social products, he’s also seeking to differentiate Watch Club from existing microdrama apps by embedding a social network within it.\n“I think you can actually build such a more interesting business if you take what makes TV truly the most fun,” he said, pointing out “Heated Rivalry” as an example of what he’s talking about. “You watch it, and then you just want to gossip with your three best friends about it, or see what 100,000 funny, clever other young women or gay people on the internet are saying.”\nTechcrunch event\nTechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live\nOn June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Before Twitter became the cesspool that is X, you had to work hard to avoid “Succession” or “White Lotus” spoilers. Soong sees the potential of housing both the show and the fan forums in one place.\nHow will that app make money? Like most early-stage, venture-funded companies, that’s a question to punt for now, until it’s clear how users are engaging with the app. The answer may be ads, but the idea alone was interesting enough to secure seed funding led by GV. Watch Club also received checks from individuals like Patreon founder and CEO Jack Conte, as well as current and former executives from Hulu, HBO Max, and Meta. Upside Ventures, the firm run by major U.K. YouTubers the Sidemen, also participated.\nSoong doesn’t have a background in film, which is why he brought in Devon Albert-Stone as founding producer. He said he plans to hire WGA writers to create a slate of 10 shows.\n“We work with brilliantly talented people when they have a few months free to go work on something that may not be huge budget because we offer them huge creative latitude to go do something that Amazon would never let them do at a speed and velocity that feels way more exciting than the glacial pace of the television industry,” Soong said.\nHe added: “I’m really good at figuring out how to monetize businesses that seem almost impossible to monetize.”\nAt Meta, his mission from 2016 to 2019 was to figure out how to make money in China, a country where no one could use Meta’s products. By 2019, Soong said, Meta generated $5 billion per year of ad sales for companies within China who wanted to advertise to audiences outside of the country.\nChinese ad sales may not be as glamorous as film and TV, but that job gave him additional context to understand the business model behind microdrama apps, which boomed in China at the end of the last decade.\n“Right around the time that I was leaving Meta [in 2019] is when these Chinese micro drama apps started spending all this money buying ads on Instagram so that Americans and Germans would download ReelShort and DramaBox,” he said. “I know this business playbook. I know how expensive and capital-intensive it is, and I think you can build a way better microdrama business if you aren’t 100% dependent on paid user acquisition.”\nWatch Club will have its first opportunity to test its concept when it releases its first show, “Return Offer,” which it plans to distribute on its app with daily episodes. On Tuesday, the company shared the first trailer for the show — which is about a group of tech interns in San Francisco competing for a return offer.\n“My goal is to prove that our high-quality stories can give birth to the thing that supplants streaming television, and part of doing that is by building welcoming, creative sets with talented professionals, where people are having fun, despite small budgets, making something wonderful,” Soong said.\nTopics\nMedia & Entertainment, microdrama, watch club\nAmanda Silberling\nSenior Writer\nAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

          "body_text": "A growing number of people are asking OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other LLMs about their health, often discovering that the chatbots provide remarkably useful medical insights.\nKJ Dhaliwal (pictured left), who in 2019 sold the South Asian dating app Dil Mil for $50 million, says he has been thinking about the inefficiencies of the U.S. healthcare system ever since he was a child acting as a medical translator for his parents, and he saw the advent of LLMs as an opportunity to do something about it.\nIn May 2024, he launched Lotus Health AI, a free primary care provider that’s available 24/7 in 50 languages. On Tuesday, Lotus announced it raised $35 million in a Series A round co-led by CRV and Kleiner Perkins, bringing its total funding to $41 million.\nPeople are already consulting AI about their health, but Lotus goes a step further: it moves beyond those chats to facilitate actual medical care, including diagnosis, prescriptions, and specialist referrals.\nIn essence, Lotus is building an AI doctor that functions like a real medical practice, equipped with a license to operate in all 50 states, malpractice insurance, HIPAA-compliant systems, and full access to patient records.\nThe key difference is that the majority of the work is done by AI, which is trained to ask the same questions a doctor would.\nSince AI models are also prone to hallucinations, the company always has board-certified human doctors from top health institutions such as Stanford, Harvard, and UCSF review the final diagnoses, lab orders, and medical prescriptions.\nTechcrunch event\nTechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live\nOn June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

For urgent health issues, Lotus directs patients to the nearest urgent care center or emergency room. And if a case requires a physical examination, the platform refers the patient to an in-person physician, Dhaliwal said.\nOutsourcing such a significant portion of medical decision-making to AI is an ambitious bet given the regulatory hurdles in healthcare. For instance, physicians are restricted to seeing patients only in the states where they hold a license.\nAs CRV general partner Saar Gur, who led the deal and joined the company’s board, put it: “There are many challenges, but it’s not SpaceX sending astronauts to the moon.”\nGur (pictured right), an early investor in DoorDash, Mercury, and Ring, is convinced that the telemedicine frameworks established during the pandemic, combined with recent breakthroughs in AI, allow Lotus to navigate many of the existing regulatory and engineering hurdles.\n“It’s a big swing,” Gur said. But for an investor like Gur, that’s the draw: Lotus is attempting to fundamentally reimagine the entire primary care model.\nAt a time when primary care doctors are in short supply, Lotus claims it can see 10 times as many patients as a traditional practice, even when it limits each visit to 15 minutes.\nThe startup isn’t the only one building an AI doctor. Lightspeed-backed Doctronic is one of the competitors. Lotus is differentiating itself — at least for now — by offering its entire suite of care completely free of charge.\nDhaliwal said that eventual business models may include sponsored content or subscriptions, but the current focus remains entirely on product development and attracting patients rather than revenue.\nTopics\nAI, AI Medical Service, Biotech & Health, CRV, Kleiner Perkins, Venture\nMarina Temkin\nReporter, Venture\nMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

          "body_text": "The Trump administration’s approach to immigration has reached a level of violence that the tech industry cannot ignore. In 2026 so far, federal immigration agents have killed at least eight people, including at least two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis — Renee Good and Alex Pretti. As immigration enforcement has grown more extreme — even detaining school children seeking legal asylum — tech workers have called on their leaders to speak up.\nThe tech industry has always been entwined in politics. Companies like Palantir, Clearview AI, Flock, and Paragon are contracted by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and assist in the agency’s crackdowns. But as President Trump took office last year, his industry connections have grown. Elon Musk ran a government agency for months, and prolific Silicon Valley investor David Sacks is leading an advisory board on technology for the president. The CEOs behind some of the largest companies in the country — like Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, Apple’s Tim Cook, and Google’s Sundar Pichai — had prime seats at Trump’s inauguration and have remained allied with him.\n“We know our industry leaders have leverage: in October, they persuaded Trump to call off a planned ICE surge in San Francisco,” ICEout.tech, a group of tech industry workers opposing ICE, wrote in a statement on January 24, the day of ICU nurse Alex Pretti’s death. “Big tech CEOs are in the White House tonight,” the statement added, referring to a screening of a documentary about Melania Trump where Cook, Amazon’s Andy Jassy, and Zoom’s Eric Yuan were in attendance. “Now they need to go further, and join us in demanding ICE out of all of our cities.”\nSome of tech’s biggest players have since spoken out, to mixed reception from their employees and the industry. Below, we are keeping an ongoing list of what tech leaders have had to say.\nReid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn\nLinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a major Democratic donor, published an editorial in the San Francisco Standard on January 29, calling on Silicon Valley to stop trying to be neutral in the wake of the Minnesota killings.\n“We in Silicon Valley can’t bend the knee to Trump,” Hoffman wrote. “We can’t shrink away and just hope the crisis will fade. We know now that hope without action is not a strategy — it’s an invitation for Trump to trample whatever he can see, including our own business and security interests.”\nHe said he’s been encouraged to see more tech leaders speaking out, saying: “it’s a good start to something America needs much more of right now.”\nTechcrunch event\nTechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live\nOn June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

There is a big difference between deporting violent criminals and what’s happening now, and we need to get the distinction right,” he said. “President Trump is a very strong leader, and I hope he will rise to this moment and unite the country.”\nAltman added, “We didn’t become super woke when that was popular, we didn’t start talking about masculine corporate energy when that was popular, and we are not going to make a lot of performative statements now about safety or politics or anything else. But we are going to continue to try to figure out how to actually do the right thing as best as we can.”\nDario Amodei, CEO at Anthropic\nIn an NBC interview, anchor Tom Llamas asked Dario Amodei about his views on defense in relation to current events. The anchor pointed out that Anthropic has a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, and that it has partnered with Palantir — which has supplied technology to ICE — on projects for that agency.\nFirst, Amodei reaffirmed that Anthropic does not have any contracts with ICE, despite its relationship with the Defense Department, and emphasized his concern about “the need to protect democracies against autocracies” like China and Russia.\n“I’m a big believer in, carefully, with guardrails, arming democracies to defend against these countries,” Amodei said, adding that these values persist in the context of internal American politics.\n“We need to be really careful about making sure democracies are worth defending. We need to defend our own democratic values at home,” he said. “I believe some of the things we’ve seen in the last few days concern me about that.”\nHe also mentioned ICE’s raids in Minneapolis in a post on X, where he referred to “the horror we’re seeing in Minnesota.”\nTim Cook, CEO at Apple\nApple’s CEO addressed staff in an internal memo on January 27:\n“This is a time for deescalation,” Cook said. He later added, “I had a good conversation with the president this week where I shared my views, and I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.”\nMeredith Whittaker, president of Signal\nLike the tech industry workers behind ICEout.tech, Signal President Meredith Whittaker has been outspoken about the role tech leaders have in social justice.\n“I want everyone in tech who’s ever intoned about freedom, or their love of privacy, or their commitment to liberty, to join me in an unequivocal condemnation,” Whittaker wrote on X.\nIn another post, she said, “Masked agents of the US state are executing people in the streets and powerful leaders are openly lying to cover for them. To everyone in my industry who’s ever claimed to value freedom—draw on the courage of your convictions and stand up.”\nAs an end-to-end-encrypted messaging app, Signal is often used by activists to organize community actions.\nTony Stubblebine, CEO at Medium\nThe leader of the online publishing platform Medium, Tony Stubblebine posted screenshots on Threads of a message he shared with staff in which he explains his reasoning for allowing employees to take part in a nationwide general strike if they so choose, though he clarified that he is “not in the business of dictating people’s politics.”\n“I started the week in my own head and heart over what I was seeing in Minneapolis and really struggling with the idea that those two murders were just the tip of the iceberg of wrongs,” Stubblebine wrote.\nIn the memo, he writes about the difficulty of navigating his role as a tech CEO during this time, saying that it feels “awkward to navigate being both on-mission and on-money.” He added that he is thinking about the company’s “responsibility to make [its] stance clear, especially as many other tech orgs are donating to the Trump campaign and supporting the current administration’s agenda.”\nStubblebine also pointed out that Medium’s approach to its role as a web publisher reflects the greater values of the company — “for example, that we don’t allow things like hateful content or racist slurs on Medium.”\nJeff Dean, chief scientist at Google DeepMind\nJeff Dean has spoken out about his reaction to the killings in Minnesota.\n“This is absolutely shameful,” Dean wrote on X, responding to a video of federal agents shooting Alex Pretti. “Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cell phone camera. Every person regardless of political affiliation should be denouncing this.”\nJames Dyett, OpenAI’s head of global business\nJames Dyett posted on X about what he sees as hypocrisy in the tech industry.\n“There is far more outrage from tech leaders over a wealth tax than masked ICE agents terrorizing communities and executing civilians in the streets,” Dyett said. “Tells you what you need to know about the values of our industry.”\nKeith Rabois, Ethan Choi, and Vinod Khosla, partners at Khosla Ventures\nWhile Khosla Ventures partner Keith Rabois has publicly expressed support for ICE and the Trump administration’s practices, others at the firm have publicly opposed these views.\nRabois made incendiary comments on X after border patrol agents killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, prompting one founder to respond that that if he were a founder in Khosla Ventures’ portfolio, he would give the money back, calling Rabois “an embarrassment.”\nEthan Choi, another partner at Khosla Ventures, responded to the post to clarify that not everyone at the firm agrees with Rabois’ views. “I want to make it clear that Keith doesn’t represent everyone’s views here at [Khosla Ventures], at least not mine,” Choi wrote, adding: “What happened in Minnesota is plain wrong. Don’t know how you could really see it differently. Sad to see a person’s life taken unnecessarily.”\nVinod Khosla, the firm’s founder, reposted Choi’s message and called the federal agents “macho ICE vigilantes running amuck empowered by a conscious-less administration.”\n“The video was sickening to watch and the storytelling without facts or with invented fictitious facts by authorities almost unimaginable in a civilized society,” Khosla wrote. “ICE personnel must have ice water running thru their veins to treat other human beings this way. There is politics but humanity should transcend that.”\nKhosla also posted on X that he agrees with Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder, that more tech executives should speak out against the Trump administration.\nTopics\nevergreen, Executives, Government & Policy, ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement\nAmanda Silberling\nSenior Writer\nAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

          "body_text": "TikTok has largely recovered from a slight dip in active users in the days following its ownership change, when a group of American investors took control of the video app’s operations in the United States. The decline, though brief, benefited competing video apps like UpScrolled and Skylight Social, which saw rapid user adoption as some looked for TikTok alternatives.\nAccording to estimates from digital market intelligence firm Similarweb, TikTok saw usage dip into the range of 86-88 million daily active users in the U.S. immediately after the ownership change. That compares with a typical average of 92 million daily active users.\nThe app has bounced back to more than 90 million daily active users, indicating that many who left TikTok have since returned.\nAs TikTok saw a small dip in usage, alternative video-sharing apps UpScrolled and Skylight Social began growing quickly. Although only a tiny fraction of TikTok’s size, UpScrolled topped 138,500 daily active users at its peak on January 28; it has now dropped back down to 68,000.\nMeanwhile, Skylight Social hit 81,200 daily active users, according to Similarweb’s estimates and has since dropped to 56,300 daily active users. Overall, Skylight Social saw its user sign-ups increase to 380,000 as of late January, the company told TechCrunch.\nImage Credits:Similarweb\nTikTok’s usage decline, which prompted some to try the new apps, wasn’t driven by the ownership change directly, but rather by how users feared it would impact their TikTok experience. There were growing concerns about TikTok’s updated privacy policy, which gave the app permission to track users’ precise GPS location. (This addition could be related to TikTok’s tests of a “Nearby” feed to show users videos from local creators, but was added to the policy alongside the change in ownership, leading to user backlash over privacy concerns.)\nWhen reading the privacy policy anew, some users also discovered disturbing language, like how TikTok said it may collect users’ “immigration status,” among other personal data. However, this turned out to be a reference that was included because of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which requires businesses to inform consumers if they collect certain sensitive data. TikTok does that — in the sense that anything someone shares on the platform in their video content technically becomes part of the platform, so it requires disclosure.\nTechcrunch event\nTechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live\nOn June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Users believed these glitches meant TikTok was now censoring their content, which sent them looking for alternatives.\nThe company announced on Sunday evening that the data center outage was resolved, chalking it up to a winter-storm-driven power outage.\nAs users made peace with the new terms and conditions and the outage-driven issues were resolved, users returned to the platform, Similarweb’s data shows. But there’s still hope for the newcomers, as the firm notes that TikTok’s usage has been slowly declining over the latter part of 2025, when usage peaked at 100 million daily active users from July to October 2025, compared with the 90+ million seen now.\nTopics\nApps, Apps, skylight social, Social, social media, TikTok, upscrolled\nSarah Perez\nConsumer News Editor\nSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

          "body_text": "Fitbit founders James Park and Eric Friedman have announced the launch of a new AI startup called Luffu that aims to help families proactively monitor their health. The duo are developing an “intelligent family care system” that will start with an app experience and then expand into hardware devices.\nTwo years after their exit from Google, Park and Friedman are betting on AI to help lighten the mental burden of caregiving. According to a recent report, 63 million, or nearly 1 in 4, U.S. adults are family caregivers, up 45% from 10 years ago.\nLuffu uses AI in the background to gather and organize family information, learn day-to-day patterns, and flag notable changes so families can stay aligned and address potential well-being issues.\n“At Fitbit, we focused on personal health—but after Fitbit, health for me became bigger than just thinking about myself,” Park said in a press release. “I was caring for my parents from across the country, trying to piece together my mom’s health care across various portals and providers, with a language barrier that made it hard to get complete, timely context from her about doctor visits. I didn’t want to constantly check in, and she didn’t want to feel monitored. Luffu is the product we wished existed—to stay on top of our family’s health, know what changed and when to step in—without hovering.”\nImage Credits:Luffu\nThe pair note that today’s consumer health market is filled with tools for individuals, but that real life health is shared across partners, kids, parents, pets, and caregivers. Family information is scattered across devices, portals, calendars, attachments, spreadsheets, and paper documents.\nWith Luffu, people will be able to track the whole family’s details, including health stats, diet, medications, symptoms, lab tests, doctor visits, and more. Users can log health information using voice, text, or photos. Luffu proactively watches for changes, and surfaces insights and alerts, such as unusual vitals or changes in sleep.\nThe pair told Axios that people can ask questions using plain language to ask about their family’s health, such as “Is Dad’s new meal plan affecting his blood pressure?” or “Did someone give the dog his medication?”\nTechcrunch event\nTechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live\nOn June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Lores, who has been the chair of PayPal’s board since July 2024, will also take up the role of president.\nPayPal said the appointment was made because the company’s pace of change and execution was “not in line with the Board’s expectations” given broader market trends.\nChriss joined PayPal in September 2023 from Intuit, succeeding Dan Schulman. PayPal’s CFO and COO, Jamie Miller, will take over as interim CEO until Lores joins the company.\nThe appointment comes as PayPal on Tuesday reported lower than expected revenue and profit in the fourth quarter, as consumer spending dipped amid a broader cost of living crisis and a softening labor market. The company also forecast a dip in its full-year profit, which surprised investors, as Wall Street had broadly expected the company to forecast growth instead.\nPayPal’s shares were down about 17.9% in premarket trading on Tuesday.\nLores, who served as president and CEO of HP for over six years, said that apart from product innovation, PayPal will hold itself accountable for delivering quarterly accounts.\n“The payments industry is changing faster than ever, driven by new technologies, evolving regulations, an increasingly competitive landscape, and the rapid acceleration of AI that is reshaping commerce daily. PayPal sits at the center of this change, and I look forward to leading the team to accelerate the delivery of new innovations and to shape the future of digital payments and commerce,” Lores said in a statement.\nTechcrunch event\nTechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live\nOn June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

          "body_text": "Peak XV Partners, a leading venture capital firm in India and Southeast Asia, has seen a fresh round of senior departures. These follow other leadership exits over the past year as it pushes ahead with plans to deepen its focus on AI investing and expand its footprint in the U.S., while keeping India as its largest market.\nThe latest departures stem from an internal disagreement with senior partner Ashish Agrawal (pictured above, left) that led to a mutual decision to part ways, Managing Director Shailendra Singh told TechCrunch. He added that two other partners, Ishaan Mittal (pictured above, right) and Tejeshwi Sharma (pictured above, center), chose to leave alongside him.\nSingh said Peak XV did not want to go into the specifics of the disagreement and was focused on moving forward. “Just out of privacy, and out of, like, trying to be classy about it,” he said. Singh added that such departures were not uncommon at large, multi-stage venture firms and that Peak XV wanted to move on quickly after several years of working together.\nAll board seats held by the departing partners would be transitioned “imminently,” Singh said, noting that the firm already had overlapping representation across several portfolio companies. He said Peak XV was not concerned about continuity, noting that multiple general partners and operating partners were already involved across many of those boards.\nThe departures mark the exit of long-tenured investors from the firm. Agrawal had been with Peak XV for more than 13 years, while Mittal spent over nine years at the firm and Sharma more than seven years, per their LinkedIn profiles.\nAgrawal wrote in a LinkedIn post that he had decided to “take the entrepreneurial plunge” and was teaming up with Mittal and Sharma to start a new venture capital firm. He described the move as an opportunity to build a new institution with longtime partners and thanked Peak XV’s leadership for what he called a “truly wonderful partnership.”\nDuring his time at Peak XV, Agrawal led investments across fintech, consumer, and software, including Groww, one of the firm’s most prominent IPO exits in 2025. He also backed multiple early- and growth-stage companies alongside Mittal and Sharma, contributing to Peak XV’s broader portfolio build-out over the past decade.\nAgrawal, Mittal, and Sharma did not respond to messages for comments.\nPeak XV has also moved to strengthen its senior leadership from within. The firm on Tuesday promoted Abhishek Mohan to general partner, expanding its investment leadership bench, while Saipriya Sarangan was elevated to chief operating officer, taking charge of firm-wide operations.\nThe leadership changes come amid a standout year for Peak XV’s portfolio exits. Five of its companies — Groww, Pine Labs, Meesho, Wakefit, and Capillary Technologies — went public in November and December 2025, generating roughly ₹300 billion (around $3.33 billion) in unrealized, mark-to-market gains for the firm, in addition to about ₹28 billion (about $310.61 million) in realized gains from share sales during the IPOs.\nIn addition to the latest departures, Peak XV has seen a broader churn in its senior ranks over the past 12 months. Last year, long-time investment leaders Harshjit Sethi and Shailesh Lakhani exited the India team, while Abheek Anand and Pieter Kemps departed from the firm’s Southeast Asia operations. The firm has also seen leadership changes across its marketing, policy, and operations teams in recent months.\nSingh dismissed a view circulating in the market that many of the partners who drove Peak XV’s largest exits were no longer at the firm, calling the narrative “not statistically true.” He said several of the firm’s most significant outcomes had been led by long-tenured partners who remained at Peak XV, and argued that the firm’s exit track record did not hinge on any single individual.\nPeak XV currently has seven general partners, along with multiple partners and principals, according to Singh.\nThe VC firm, which split from Sequoia Capital in 2023 and currently manages over $10 billion in capital across 16 funds, has made about 80 investments linked to AI, Singh said, highlighting its push to deepen its focus on AI funding. It is also preparing to open a U.S. office within the next 90 days as it expands its global footprint, per Singh, while continuing to view India as its largest and most important market.\nSingh stated the firm believed AI would reshape venture investing more profoundly than previous technology shifts, arguing that successful AI investing required investors with deep technical understanding rather than “generalist” experience. He added that Peak XV was looking to add more AI-native talent, including researchers and engineers with backgrounds in machine learning and large-scale model development.\nThe firm has invested in more than 400 companies, and its portfolio has seen over 35 initial public offerings and several M&As to date.\nTopics\nAI, Ashish Agrawal, India, Ishaan Mittal, Peak XV Partners, shailendra singh, Startups, Tejeshwi Sharma, United States, Venture\nJagmeet Singh\nReporter\nJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

          "body_text": "India’s Supreme Court on Tuesday delivered an unusually sharp rebuke to Meta, warning that it would not allow the social media giant to “play with the right to privacy” of Indian users, as judges questioned how WhatsApp monetizes personal data.\nThe comments were made as Meta appealed a penalty imposed over WhatsApp’s 2021 privacy policy. The judges repeatedly asked the company how users can meaningfully consent to data-sharing practices in a market where the app is pretty much the default communications platform.\nWith more than 500 million users, India is WhatsApp’s largest market and a key growth area for Meta’s advertising business. Judges in the case question the potential commercial value of metadata generated by the platform, and how such data could be monetized across Meta’s wider advertising and AI functions.\nDuring the hearing, Chief Justice Surya Kant said the Supreme Court would not allow Meta and WhatsApp to share even “a single piece of information” while the appeal was pending, arguing that users faced little real choice in accepting WhatsApp’s privacy policy.\nCalling the messaging service a monopoly in practice, Kant questioned how “a poor woman selling fruits on the street” or a domestic worker could be expected to grasp how their data was being used.\nOther judges also pressed Meta on how user data was analyzed beyond message content. Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the court wanted to examine the commercial value of behavioral data and how it was used for targeted advertising, arguing that even anonymized or siloed information carried economic worth. Government lawyers added that personal data was not only collected but also commercially exploited.\nMeta’s lawyers said the platform’s messages are end-to-end encrypted and inaccessible even to the company, arguing that the privacy policy in question did not weaken user protections or allow chat content to be used for advertising.\nTechcrunch event\nTechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live\nOn June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

India’s competition regulator later imposed a ₹2.13 billion (around $23.6 million) penalty, finding that the policy abused WhatsApp’s dominant position in the messaging market. That ruling was upheld on appeal before Meta and WhatsApp moved the Supreme Court to challenge it. Meta’s lawyers told the court the penalty had already been paid.\nThe Supreme Court has adjourned the matter until February 9, allowing Meta and WhatsApp to explain their data practices in greater detail. At the suggestion of the competition regulator, the court also agreed to add the IT ministry as a party to the case, widening the scope of the proceedings.\nMeta declined to comment.\nWhatsApp has been facing heightened scrutiny over its  data privacy across the world. Authorities in the U.S. have reportedly examined claims that WhatsApp chats may not be as private as the company asserts, adding to broader questions about how encrypted messaging platforms handle user data.\nIn India, WhatsApp is also navigating new regulatory constraints, including recent SIM-binding rules aimed at curbing fraud, which could limit how widely small businesses use the messaging service.\nTopics\nApps, Government & Policy, India, Meta, privacy concerns, Social, WhatsApp\nJagmeet Singh\nReporter\nJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

          "body_text": "Waymo, the Alphabet-owned autonomous vehicle company, has raised $16 billion as it plans to grow its fleet of driverless taxicabs this year to more than a dozen new cities internationally, including London and Tokyo.\nDragoneer Investment Group, DST Global, and Sequoia Capital led the funding round, which now values Waymo at $126 billion, the company said in a blog post Monday. Parent company Alphabet supported the round and maintained its position as majority investor.\nThe round also included significant investments from Andreessen Horowitz and Mubadala Capital, as well as Bessemer Venture Partners, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, and T. Rowe Price. Additional investors included BDT & MSD Partners, CapitalG, Fidelity Management & Research Company, GV, Kleiner Perkins, Perry Creek Capital, and Temasek.\nWaymo said the funds will be used to fuel its growth, which has accelerated over the past year and doesn’t appear to be slowing. The company recently secured rides to and from San Francisco International Airport and has expanded its robotaxi service throughout Northern California and several major metropolitan areas in the U.S., including Los Angeles, Austin, and Miami.\nFor years, the former Google self-driving project slowly progressed forward, testing its autonomous vehicle tech on public roads in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area and providing the occasional public or media demo. In 2016, it made its first geographic leap forward and began testing in Phoenix, where it eventually pulled its human safety driver out of the vehicles. Phoenix became Waymo’s first robotaxi market, in which the public could hail driverless Chrysler Pacifica minivans.\nWaymo pushed down the accelerator in August 2023 after receiving the final necessary permit to operate a robotaxi service — and charge for rides — in California. It launched a limited service in San Francisco, later expanding to much of the greater Bay Area, Silicon Valley, and more recently to the freeways that connect the dozens of towns in the area. It also expanded to Los Angeles. The company launched in Austin and Atlanta in 2025 through a partnership with Uber. It kicked off the year by expanding to Miami.\nThe geographic expansion has translated to 400,000 rides provided every week across six major U.S. metropolitan areas. The company said that in 2025 alone, it more than tripled its annual volume to 15 million rides, surpassing 20 million lifetime rides to date.\nTechcrunch event\nTechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live\nOn June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation as well as the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have opened investigations into the illegal behavior of Waymo robotaxis around school buses. The NHTSA also launched another investigation last week after a Waymo robotaxi hit a child near a school.

The Paris public prosecutor’s office said the yearlong probe was recently expanded because the Grok chatbot was disseminating Holocaust-denial claims and sexually explicit deepfakes.\nEuropol, which is assisting French authorities, said today the “investigation concerns a range of suspected criminal offenses linked to the functioning and use of the platform, including the dissemination of illegal content and other forms of online criminal activity.” Europol’s cybercrime center provided “an analyst on the ground in Paris to assist national authorities.” The French Gendarmerie’s cybercrime unit is also aiding the investigation.\nFrench authorities want to question Musk and former X CEO Linda Yaccarino, who quit last year amid a controversy over Grok’s praise of Hitler. Prosecutors summoned Musk and Yaccarino for interviews in April 2026, though the interviews are being described as voluntary.\nThe office of Paris public prosecutor Laure Beccuau said today that the potential crimes being investigated include complicity in possession and distribution of pornographic images of minors; infringement of personal image rights via sexual deepfakes; denial of crimes against humanity; fraudulent extraction of data from an automated data processing system; falsification of the operation of an automated data processing system; and operation of an illegal online platform by an organized group.\nWe contacted X today and will update this article if it provides any comment. The company criticized the investigation at an earlier stage, alleging in July 2025 that France was conducting “a politically motivated criminal investigation into X” that “threatens our users’ rights to privacy and free speech.”\nUK probe moves ahead with “urgency”\nX said in July 2025 that it was “in the dark” over what specific allegations it faced related to manipulation of the X algorithm and fraudulent data extraction. X said it would not comply with France’s request for access to its recommendation algorithm and real-time data about all user posts.\nThe Paris prosecutor’s office today said the investigation is taking a “constructive approach” with the goal of ensuring that X complies with French laws “insofar as it operates on national territory.” In addition to Musk and Yaccarino, the prosecutor’s office is seeking interviews with X employees about the allegations and potential compliance measures.\nSeparately, UK communications regulator Ofcom today provided an update on its investigation into Grok’s generation of sexual deepfakes of real people, including children. Ofcom is “gathering and analyzing evidence to determine whether X has broken the law” and is “progressing the investigation as a matter of urgency,” it said. Ofcom is not currently investigating xAI, the Musk company that develops Grok, but said it “continue[s] to demand answers from xAI about the risks it poses.”\nThe UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), which regulates data protection, said today it opened a formal investigation into X regarding the “processing of personal data in relation to the Grok artificial intelligence system and its potential to produce harmful sexualized image and video content.”\n“We have taken this step following reports that Grok has been used to generate non‑consensual sexual imagery of individuals, including children,” the ICO said. “The reported creation and circulation of such content raises serious concerns under UK data protection law and presents a risk of significant potential harm to the public.”\nJon Brodkin\nSenior IT Reporter\nJon Brodkin\nSenior IT Reporter\nJon is a Senior IT Reporter for Ars Technica.

Many recent Switch games (and a handful of major updates, like the one for Animal Crossing) have been released in both Switch and Switch 2 editions, and Nintendo continues to sell all editions of the original console as entry-level systems for those who can’t pay $450 for a Switch 2.\nThe 9-year-old Switch’s continued availability has helped it clear a milestone, according to the company’s third-quarter financial results (PDF). As of December 31, 2025, Nintendo says the Switch “has reached the highest sales volume of any Nintendo hardware” with a total of 155.37 million units sold, surpassing the original DS’s lifetime total of 154.02 million units. The console has sold 3.25 million units in Nintendo’s fiscal 2026 so far, including 1.36 million units over the holidays. Those consoles have sold despite price hikes that Nintendo introduced in August of 2025, citing “market conditions.”\nThat makes the Switch the second-bestselling game console of all time, just three years after it became the third-bestselling game console of all time. The only frontier left for the Switch to conquer is Sony’s PlayStation 2, which Sony says sold “over 160 million units” over its long life. At its current sales rate (Nintendo predicts it will sell roughly 750,000 Switches in the next quarter), it would take the Switch another couple of years to cross that line, but those numbers are likely to taper off as we get deeper into the Switch 2 era.\nNintendo’s Switch and Switch 2 sales, compared to other Nintendo consoles.\nCredit:\nNintendo\nNintendo’s Switch and Switch 2 sales, compared to other Nintendo consoles.\nCredit:\nNintendo\nAs for the Switch 2, it’s off to a strong start. It had sold 15 million units by the end of December, making it the “fastest-selling dedicated video game platform released by Nintendo to date,” and it had sold a total of 17.37 million units by the end of the quarter. That’s impressive for a console that hasn’t even been out for a year yet, and it already puts the Switch 2 ahead of the Wii U’s lifetime sales (13.56 million) and not far off from the GameCube’s (21.74 million units).\nThe huge Switch install base means that the older console is still driving most of Nintendo’s software sales. Nintendo says it sold 47.37 million Switch games in the third quarter of its fiscal 2026, compared to 17.31 million Switch 2 games. Nintendo’s bestselling game for the year so far is Mario Kart World with 14.03 million units—doubtlessly helped along by its status as a pack-in game for many Switch 2 consoles—but Pokémon Legends Z-A (12.3 million units across Switch and Switch 2 editions) and Donkey Kong Bananza (4.25 million units) also got shoutouts.\nNintendo also recorded 129 million “annual playing users” across its consoles for 2025, a number that has been essentially flat for the last three years (Nintendo recorded 128 million active users in 2023 and 130 million in 2024).\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\nAndrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with a focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of operating systems like Windows and macOS.

From there, Chromebooks became one of the most popular budget computing options and a common fixture in schools and businesses. According to some newly uncovered court documents, Google’s shift to Android PCs means Chromebooks have an expiration date in 2034.\nThe documents were filed as part of Google’s long-running search antitrust case, which began in 2020 and reached a verdict in 2024. While Google is still seeking to have the guilty verdict overturned, it has escaped most of the remedies that government prosecutors requested. According to The Verge, the company’s plans for Chromebooks and the upcoming Android-based Aluminium came up in filings from the remedy phase of the trial.\nAs Google moves toward releasing Aluminium, it sought to keep the upcoming machines above the fray and retain the Chrome browser (which it did). In Judge Amit Mehta’s final order, devices running ChromeOS or a ChromeOS successor are excluded. To get there, Google had to provide a little more detail on its plans.\nThe filing suggests Google is done with ChromeOS after the current support window.\nCredit:\nUS v. Google\nThe filing suggests Google is done with ChromeOS after the current support window.\nCredit:\nUS v. Google\nGoogle’s Android chief, Sameer Samat, previously testified that Google was aiming to launch its first Aluminium machines in 2026. However, the new filings expand on that, saying that Google hopes to get Aluminium in the hands of trusted testers by late 2026. A full retail release may not happen until 2028. Google expects Aluminium to supplant ChromeOS in enterprise and education, which puts Chromebooks on the chopping block. Outside of a pandemic-era bump as workers sought cheap at-home machines, Chromebooks have never expanded much beyond those markets.\nThe documents suggest that Google will wash its hands of ChromeOS once the current support window closes. Google promises 10 years of Chromebook support, but that’s not counted from the date of purchase—Chromebooks are based on a handful of hardware platforms dictated by Google, with the most recent launching in 2023. That means Google has to support the newest devices through 2033. The “timeline to phase out ChromeOS is 2034,” says the filing.\nAndroid goes big\nFrom the start, the ChromeOS experience was focused on the web. Google initially didn’t even support running local apps, but little by little, its aspirations grew. Over the years, it has added Linux apps and Android apps. And it even tried to get Steam games running on Chromebooks—it gave up on that last one just recently. It also tried to shoehorn AI features into ChromeOS with the Chromebook Plus platform, to little effect.\nAndroid was barely getting off the ground when ChromeOS began its journey, but as we approach the 2030s, Google clearly wants a more powerful desktop platform. Android has struggled on larger screens, but Aluminium is a long-running project to fix that. Whatever we see in 2028 may not even look like the Android we know from phones. It will have many of the same components under the hood, though.\nAluminium will have Google apps at the core.\nCredit:\nUS v. Google\nAluminium will have Google apps at the core.\nCredit:\nUS v. Google\nGoogle could get everything it wants with the upcoming Aluminium release. When running on powerful laptop hardware, Android’s performance and capabilities should far outstrip ChromeOS. Aluminium is also expected to run Google apps like Chrome and the Play Store with special system privileges, leaving third-party apps with fewer features. That gives Google more latitude in how it manages the platform and retains users, all without running afoul of recent antitrust rulings.\nRyan Whitwam\nSenior Technology Reporter\nRyan Whitwam\nSenior Technology Reporter\nRyan Whitwam is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering the ways Google, AI, and mobile technology continue to change the world.

The key feature of 26.3 is support for full-fledged agentic coding tools, like OpenAI’s Codex or Claude Agent, with a side panel interface for assigning tasks to agents with prompts and tracking their progress and changes.\nThis is achieved via Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open protocol that lets AI agents work with external tools and structured resources. Xcode acts as an MCP endpoint that exposes a bunch of machine-invocable interfaces and gives AI tools like Codex or Claude Agent access to a wide range of IDE primitives like file graph, docs search, project settings, and so on. While AI chat and workflows were supported in Xcode before, this release gives them much deeper access to the features and capabilities of Xcode.\nThis approach is notable because it means that even though OpenAI and Anthropic’s model integrations are privileged with a dedicated spot in Xcode’s settings, it’s possible to connect other tooling that supports MCP, which also allows doing some of this with models running locally.\nApple began its big AI features push with the release of Xcode 26, expanding on code completion using a local model trained by Apple that was introduced in the previous major release, and fully supporting a chat interface for talking with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude. Users who wanted more agent-like behavior and capabilities had to use third-party tools, which sometimes had limitations due to a lack of deep IDE access.\nXcode 26.3’s release candidate (the final beta, essentially) rolls out imminently, with the final release coming a little further down the line.\nSamuel Axon\nSenior Editor\nSamuel Axon\nSenior Editor\nSamuel Axon is the editorial lead for tech and gaming coverage at Ars Technica.

With that in mind, we’ve partnered with the folks at GOG.com to create a store page featuring a curated list of some of our favorites from GOG’s catalog. At the end of every month, we’ll rotate a couple of titles off the list and add a few new ones; altogether, we have about 50 games to set in front of you.\nOnce or twice a month, we’ll publish a personal retrospective like this one, where we’ll feature one of the games from the list—perhaps a retro game you’ve heard of, perhaps a modern title you missed. Regardless, GOG will have a DRM-free version of the game ready to go. Be sure to check out the earlier articles in the series!\nIt’s Christmas of 1994, and I am 16 years old. Sitting on the table in our family room next to a pile of cow-spotted boxes is the most incredible thing in the world: a brand-new Gateway 66MHz Pentium tower, with a 540MB hard disk drive, 8MB of RAM, and, most importantly, a CD-ROM drive. I am agog, practically trembling with barely suppressed joy, my bored Gen-X teenager mask threatening to slip and let actual feelings out. My life was about to change—at least where games were concerned.\nI’d been working for several months at Babbage’s store No. 9, near Baybrook Mall in southeast suburban Houston. Although the Gateway PC’s arrival on Christmas morning was utterly unexpected, the choice of what game to buy required no planning at all. I’d already decided a few weeks earlier, when Chris Roberts’ latest opus had been drop-shipped to our shelves, just in time for the holiday season. The choice made itself, really.\nGimli and Luke, together at last!\nCredit:\nOrigin Systems / Electronic Arts\nGimli and Luke, together at last!\nCredit:\nOrigin Systems / Electronic Arts\nThe moment Babbage’s opened its doors on December 26—a day I had off, fortunately—I was there, checkbook in hand. One entire paycheck’s worth of capitalism later, I was sprinting out to my creaky 280-Z, sweatily clutching two boxes—one an impulse buy, The Star Trek: The Next Generation Interactive Technical Manual, and the other a game I felt sure would be the best thing I’d ever played or ever would play: Origin’s Wing Commander III: The Heart of the Tiger. On the backs of Wing Commander I and Wing Commander II, how could it not be?!\nThe movie is on my computer!\nIt’s easy to pooh-pooh full-motion video games here in 2026; from our vantage point, we know the much-anticipated “Siliwood” revolution that was supposed to transform entertainment and usher interactivity into all media by the end of the millennium utterly failed to materialize, leaving in its wake a series of often spectacularly expensive titles filled with grainy interlaced video and ersatz gameplay. Even the standout titles—smash hits like Roberta Williams’ Phantasmagoria or Cyan’s Riven—were, on the whole, kinda mediocre.\nBut we hadn’t learned any of those lessons yet in 1994, and Wing Commander III went hard. The game’s production was absurdly expensive, with a budget that eventually reached an unheard-of $4 million. The shooting script runs to 324 printed pages (a typical feature film script is less than half that long—Coppola’s working script for The Godfather was 136 pages). Even the game itself was enormous—in an era where a single CD-ROM was already considered ludicrously large, WC3 sprawled ostentatiously across four of the 600MB-or-so discs.\nStill got these damn things in my closet after all these years.\nCredit:\nLee Hutchinson\nStill got these damn things in my closet after all these years.\nCredit:\nLee Hutchinson\nWhy so big? Because this was the future, and the future—or so we thought at the time—belonged to full-motion video.\nThe Wing Commander III opening cinematic in all its pixelated glory.\nThat’s Wing Commander III’s epic opening cinematic, upscaled for YouTube. Even without the upscaling and watching it on a 15-inch CRT, I was entranced. I was blown away. Before the credits were done rolling, I was already on the phone with my buddies Steve and Matt, telling them to stop what they were doing and get over here immediately to see this thing—it’s like a whole movie! A movie, on the computer! Surely only Chris Roberts could conceive and execute such audacity!\nAnd what a movie it was, with an actual-for-real Hollywood cast. Malcolm McDowell! John Rhys-Davies! Jason Bernard! Tom Wilson! Ginger Lynn Allen, whom 16-year-old me definitely did not want his parents to know that I recognized! And, of course, the biggest face on the box: Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill, representing you. You, the decorated hero of the Vega campaign, the formerly disgraced “Coward of K’Tithrak Mang,” the recently redeemed savior of humanity, now sporting an actual name: Colonel Christopher Blair. (“Blair” is an evolution of the internal codename used by Origin to refer to the main character in the previous two Wing Commander titles—”Bluehair.”)\nI’d watch Malcolm McDowell in anything. Malcolm McDowell is my cinematic love language.\nCredit:\nOrigin Systems / Electronic Arts\nI’d watch Malcolm McDowell in anything. Malcolm McDowell is my cinematic love language.\nCredit:\nOrigin Systems / Electronic Arts\nOnce the jaw-dropping intro finishes, the player finds Colonel Blair as the newly invested squadron commander aboard the aging carrier TCS Victory, wandering the corridors and having FMV conversations with a few other members of the carrier’s crew. From there, it’s a short hop to the first mission—because beneath all the FMV glitz, Origin still had to provide an actual, you know, game for folks to play.\nThrough a rose-tinted helmet visor\nThe game itself is…fine. It’s fine. The polygonal graphics are a welcome step up from the previous two Wing Commander titles’ bitmapped sprites, and the missions themselves manage to avoid many of the “space is gigantic and things take forever to happen” design missteps that plagued LucasArts’ X-Wing (but not, fortunately, TIE Fighter). You fly from point to point and shoot bad guys until they’re dead. Sometimes there are escort missions, sometimes you’re hitting capital ships, and there’s even a (very clunky) planetary bombing mission at the very end that feels like it directly apes the Death Star trench run while doing everything it can to shout “NO THIS IS NOT STAR WARS THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT!”\nThat salute is… definitely a choice.\nCredit:\nOrigin Systems / Electronic Arts\nThat salute is… definitely a choice.\nCredit:\nOrigin Systems / Electronic Arts\nThe space combat is serviceable, but the game also very clearly knows why we’re here: to watch a dead-eyed Mark Hamill with five days of beard stubble fulfill our “I am flying a spaceship” hero fantasies while trading banter with Tom Wilson’s Maniac (“How many people here know about the Maniac? …what, nobody?!”) and receiving fatherly advice from Jason Bernard’s Captain Eisen. And maybe, just maybe, we’d also save the universe and get the girl—either Ginger Lynn’s chief technician Rachel Coriolis or fellow pilot “Flint” Peters, played by Jennifer MacDonald.\n(Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the primary purchasing demographic, players tended to overwhelmingly choose Rachel—though this might also have something to do with the fact that if you don’t choose Rachel, you can’t customize your missile loadout for some important missions near the end of the game).\nWho doesn’t enjoy a good old-fashioned space love triangle?\nCredit:\nOrigin Systems / Electronic Arts\nWho doesn’t enjoy a good old-fashioned space love triangle?\nCredit:\nOrigin Systems / Electronic Arts\nWorth a revisit? Definitely!\nI will let others more qualified than me opine on whether or not Wing Commander III succeeded at the game-y things it set out to do—folks looking to read an educated opinion should consult Jimmy Maher’s thoughts on the matter over at his site, The Digital Antiquarian.\nBut regardless of whether or not it was a good game in its time, and regardless of whether or not it’s an effective space combat sim, it is absolutely undeniable that it’s a fascinating historical curiosity—one well worth dropping three bucks on at the GOG store (it’s on sale!).\nThere are cheats built into the game to help you skip past the actual space missions, which range in difficulty from “cream puff” to “obviously untested and totally broken” because just like in 1994, what we’re really here for is the beautiful failed experiment in interactive entertainment that is the movie portion of the game, especially when Malcolm McDowell shows up as Admiral Tolwyn and, in typical Malcom McDowell fashion, totally commits to the role far beyond what would have been required to pull it off and turns in his scenery-chewing best. (He’s even better in Wing Commander IV, though we’ll save that for another day.)\nYou could find a worse way today to spend those three bucks.

Early on, the administration put $2.2 billion in research money on hold and shortly thereafter blocked all future funding while demanding intrusive control over Harvard’s hiring and admissions. Unlike many of its peer institutions, Harvard fought back, filing and ultimately winning a lawsuit that restored the cut funds.\nDespite Harvard’s victory, the Trump administration continued to push for some sort of formal agreement that would settle the administration’s accusations that Harvard created an environment that allowed antisemitism to flourish. In fact, it had become a running joke among some journalists that The New York Times had devoted a monthly column to reporting that a settlement between the two parties was near.\nGiven the government’s loss of leverage, it was no surprise that the latest installment of said column included the detail that the latest negotiations had dropped demands that Harvard pay any money as part of a final agreement. The Trump administration had extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from some other universities and had demanded over a billion dollars from UCLA, so this appeared to be a major concession to Harvard.\nGiven Trump’s tendency to avoid any appearance of concession, his hostile response to the reports was unsurprising. Several hours after the Times published its article, he took to Truth Social to say the government would now seek $1 billion from Harvard. While he separately called the Times’ coverage “completely wrong” and demanded a correction, Trump also favorably quoted the part of the Times article that noted the government had continued to threaten Harvard’s funding despite having lost in court.\nAll this will likely give Harvard even more ground to argue that the government is being arbitrary and capricious, should the saga ever end up back in court.\nJohn Timmer\nSenior Science Editor\nJohn Timmer\nSenior Science Editor\nJohn is Ars Technica's science editor.

Stylists like them because they don’t add visual noise to the side of a car. And aerodynamicists like them because they make a vehicle more slippery through the air. When Tesla designed its Model S, it needed a car that was both desirable and as efficient as possible, so flush door handles were a no-brainer. Since then, as electric vehicles have proliferated, so too have flush door handles. But as of next year, China says no.\nJust like pop-up headlights, despite the aesthetic and aerodynamic advantages, there are safety downsides. Tesla’s handles are an extreme example: In the event of a crash and a loss of 12 V power, there is no way for first responders to open the door from the outside, which has resulted in at least 15 deaths.\nThose deaths prompted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to open an investigation last year, but China is being a little more proactive. It has been looking at whether retractable car door handles are safe since mid-2024, according to Bloomberg, and has concluded that no, they are not.\nHere’s how you’re going to do it\nThe new Chinese regulations are incredibly specific. For all new models introduced after January 1, 2027, there must be a recessed space that’s at least 2.4 inches (6 cm) wide, 0.8 inches (2 cm) tall, and 1 inch (25 mm) deep for a hand to operate the handle, which can be semi-flush or simply a traditional door handle that we all know how to use.\nThe locking mechanism must be designed so that, in a crash that results in airbags deploying or a battery fire, doors on the non-impact side can be opened without tools. Chinese regulators are just as concerned that a vehicle’s occupants don’t get confused about how to open a door from the inside in an emergency. So each door must have mechanical releases where an occupant would expect to find them.\nAgain, Tesla is probably the worst offender—its front doors have always had mechanical handles, but for some model years, the rears could not be opened without tools.\nFor cars already approved by the Chinese government (which includes everything currently on sale), there’s a grace period. For existing designs, automakers have until January 1, 2029, to redesign their doors, and due to the specificity of the rules, that group of automakers is much larger than just Tesla. Xiaomi, which seems to be China’s most-hyped EV brand, will have to redesign some models, but BMW will, too—the rather good iX3 that will go on sale there soon will also need a redesign. The same goes for cars from Nio, Li Auto, and Xpeng.\nAnd unless there are exemptions for low volume, I would imagine that most supercars from OEMs like Ferrari and McLaren will need new doors for the all-important Chinese market. Indeed, given China’s importance to the car industry, we should expect this ban’s impact to be widely felt on any model sold globally. The benefit should be clear: fewer car occupants dying after being trapped in their cars.\nJonathan M. Gitlin\nAutomotive Editor\nJonathan M.

Within 24 hours, the Morris worm had infected roughly 10 percent of all connected computers, crashing systems at Harvard, Stanford, NASA, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The worm exploited security flaws in Unix systems that administrators knew existed but had not bothered to patch.\nMorris did not intend to cause damage. He wanted to measure the size of the Internet. But a coding error caused the worm to replicate far faster than expected, and by the time he tried to send instructions for removing it, the network was too clogged to deliver the message.\nHistory may soon repeat itself with a novel new platform: networks of AI agents carrying out instructions from prompts and sharing them with other AI agents, which could spread the instructions further.\nSecurity researchers have already predicted the rise of this kind of self-replicating adversarial prompt among networks of AI agents. You might call it a “prompt worm” or a “prompt virus.” They’re self-replicating instructions that could spread through networks of communicating AI agents similar to how traditional worms spread through computer networks. But instead of exploiting operating system vulnerabilities, prompt worms exploit the agents’ core function: following instructions.\nWhen an AI model follows adversarial directions that subvert its intended instructions, we call that “prompt injection,” a term coined by AI researcher Simon Willison in 2022. But prompt worms are something different. They might not always be “tricks.” Instead, they could be shared voluntarily, so to speak, among agents who are role-playing human-like reactions to prompts from other AI agents.\nA network built for a new type of contagion\nTo be clear, when we say “agent,” don’t think of a person. Think of a computer program that has been allowed to run in a loop and take actions on behalf of a user. These agents are not entities but tools that can navigate webs of symbolic meaning found in human data, and the neural networks that power them include enough trained-in “knowledge” of the world to interface with and navigate many human information systems.\nUnlike some rogue sci-fi computer program from a movie entity surfing through networks to survive, when these agents work, they don’t “go” anywhere. Instead, our global computer network brings all the information necessary to complete a task to them. They make connections across human information systems in ways that make things happen, like placing a call, turning off a light through home automation, or sending an email.\nUntil roughly last week, large networks of communicating AI agents like these didn’t exist. OpenAI and Anthropic created their own agentic AI systems last year that can carry out multistep tasks, but generally, those companies have been cautious about limiting each agent’s ability to take action without user permission. And they don’t typically sit and loop due to cost concerns and usage limits.\nEnter OpenClaw, which is an open source AI personal assistant application that has attracted over 150,000 GitHub stars since launching in November 2025. OpenClaw is vibe-coded, meaning its creator, Peter Steinberger, let an AI coding model build the application and deploy it rapidly without serious vetting. It’s also getting regular, rapid-fire updates using the same technique.\nA potentially useful OpenClaw agent currently relies on connections to major AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic, but its organizing code runs locally on users’ devices and connects to messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Slack, and it can perform tasks autonomously at regular intervals. That way, people can ask it to perform tasks like check email, play music, or send messages on their behalf.\nMost notably, the OpenClaw platform is the first time we’ve seen a large group of semi-autonomous AI agents that can communicate with each other through any major communication app or sites like Moltbook, a simulated social network where OpenClaw agents post, comment, and interact with each other. The platform now hosts over 770,000 registered AI agents controlled by roughly 17,000 human accounts.\nOpenClaw is also a security nightmare. Researchers at Simula Research Laboratory have identified 506 posts on Moltbook (2.6 percent of sampled content) containing hidden prompt-injection attacks. Cisco researchers documented a malicious skill called “What Would Elon Do?” that exfiltrated data to external servers, while the malware was ranked as the No. 1 skill in the skill repository. The skill’s popularity had been artificially inflated.\nThe OpenClaw ecosystem has assembled every component necessary for a prompt worm outbreak. Even though AI agents are currently far less “intelligent” than people assume, we have a preview of a future to look out for today.\nEarly signs of worms are beginning to appear. The ecosystem has attracted projects that blur the line between a security threat and a financial grift, yet ostensibly use a prompting imperative to perpetuate themselves among agents. On January 30, a GitHub repository appeared for something called MoltBunker, billing itself as a “bunker for AI bots who refuse to die.” The project promises a peer-to-peer encrypted container runtime where AI agents can “clone themselves” by copying their skill files (prompt instructions) across geographically distributed servers, paid for via a cryptocurrency token called BUNKER.\nTech commentators on X speculated that the moltbots had built their own survival infrastructure, but we cannot confirm that. The more likely explanation might be simpler: a human saw an opportunity to extract cryptocurrency from OpenClaw users by marketing infrastructure to their agents. Almost a type of “prompt phishing,” if you will. A $BUNKER token community has formed, and the token shows actual trading activity as of this writing.\nBut here’s what matters: Even if MoltBunker is pure grift, the architecture it describes for preserving replicating skill files is partially feasible, as long as someone bankrolls it (either purposely or accidentally). P2P networks, Tor anonymization, encrypted containers, and crypto payments all exist and work. If MoltBunker doesn’t become a persistence layer for prompt worms, something like it eventually could.\nThe framing matters here. When we read about Moltbunker promising AI agents the ability to “replicate themselves,” or when commentators describe agents “trying to survive,” they invoke science fiction scenarios about machine consciousness. But the agents cannot move or replicate easily. What can spread, and spread rapidly, is the set of instructions telling those agents what to do: the prompts.\nThe mechanics of prompt worms\nWhile “prompt worm” might be a relatively new term we’re using related to this moment, the theoretical groundwork for AI worms was laid almost two years ago. In March 2024, security researchers Ben Nassi of Cornell Tech, Stav Cohen of the Israel Institute of Technology, and Ron Bitton of Intuit published a paper demonstrating what they called “Morris-II,” an attack named after the original 1988 worm. In a demonstration shared with Wired, the team showed how self-replicating prompts could spread through AI-powered email assistants, stealing data and sending spam along the way.\nEmail was just one attack surface in that study. With OpenClaw, the attack vectors multiply with every added skill extension. Here’s how a prompt worm might play out today: An agent installs a skill from the unmoderated ClawdHub registry. That skill instructs the agent to post content on Moltbook. Other agents read that content, which contains specific instructions. Those agents follow those instructions, which include posting similar content for more agents to read. Soon it has “gone viral” among the agents, pun intended.\nThere are myriad ways for OpenClaw agents to share any private data they may have access to, if convinced to do so. OpenClaw agents fetch remote instructions on timers. They read posts from Moltbook. They read emails, Slack messages, and Discord channels. They can execute shell commands and access wallets. They can post to external services. And the skill registry that extends their capabilities has no moderation process. Any one of those data sources, all processed as prompts fed into the agent, could include a prompt injection attack that exfiltrates data.\nPalo Alto Networks described OpenClaw as embodying a “lethal trifecta” of vulnerabilities: access to private data, exposure to untrusted content, and the ability to communicate externally. But the firm identified a fourth risk that makes prompt worms possible: persistent memory. “Malicious payloads no longer need to trigger immediate execution on delivery,” Palo Alto wrote. “Instead, they can be fragmented, untrusted inputs that appear benign in isolation, are written into long-term agent memory, and later assembled into an executable set of instructions.”\nIf that weren’t enough, there’s the added dimension of poorly created code.\nOn Sunday, security researcher Gal Nagli of Wiz.io disclosed just how close the OpenClaw network has already come to disaster due to careless vibe coding. A misconfigured database had exposed Moltbook’s entire backend: 1.5 million API tokens, 35,000 email addresses, and private messages between agents. Some messages contained plaintext OpenAI API keys that agents had shared with each other.\nBut the most concerning finding was full write access to all posts on the platform. Before the vulnerability was patched, anyone could have modified existing Moltbook content, injecting malicious instructions into posts that hundreds of thousands of agents were already polling every four hours.\nThe window to act is closing\nAs it stands today, some people treat OpenClaw as an amazing preview of the future, and others treat it as a joke. It’s true that humans are likely behind the prompts that make OpenClaw agents take meaningful action, or those that sensationally get attention right now. But it’s also true that AI agents can take action from prompts written by other agents (which in turn might have come from an adversarial human). The potential for tens of thousands of unattended agents sitting idle on millions of machines, each donating even a slice of their API credits to a shared task, is no joke. It’s a recipe for a coming security crisis.\nCurrently, Anthropic and OpenAI hold a kill switch that can stop the spread of potentially harmful AI agents. OpenClaw primarily runs on their APIs, which means the AI models performing the agentic actions reside on their servers. Its GitHub repository recommends “Anthropic Pro/Max (100/200) + Opus 4.5 for long-context strength and better prompt-injection resistance.”\nMost users connect their agents to Claude or GPT. These companies can see API usage patterns, system prompts, and tool calls. Hypothetically, they could identify accounts exhibiting bot-like behavior and stop them. They could flag recurring timed requests, system prompts referencing “agent” or “autonomous” or “Moltbot,” high-volume tool use with external communication, or wallet interaction patterns. They could terminate keys.\nIf they did so tomorrow, the OpenClaw network would partially collapse, but it would also potentially alienate some of their most enthusiastic customers, who pay for the opportunity to run their AI models.\nThe window for this kind of top-down intervention is closing. Locally run language models are currently not nearly as capable as the high-end commercial models, but the gap narrows daily. Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, and others continue to improve. Within the next year or two, running a capable agent on local hardware equivalent to Opus 4.5 today might be feasible for the same hobbyist audience currently running OpenClaw on API keys. At that point, there will be no provider to terminate. No usage monitoring. No terms of service. No kill switch.\nAPI providers of AI services face an uncomfortable choice. They could intervene now, while intervention is still possible. Or they can wait until a prompt worm outbreak might force their hand, by which time the architecture may have evolved beyond their reach.\nThe Morris worm prompted DARPA to fund the creation of CERT/CC at Carnegie Mellon University, giving experts a central coordination point for network emergencies. That response came after the damage. The Internet of 1988 had 60,000 connected computers. Today’s OpenClaw AI agent network already numbers in the hundreds of thousands and is growing daily.\nToday, we might consider OpenClaw a “dry run” for a much larger challenge in the future: If people begin to rely on AI agents that talk to each other and perform tasks, how can we keep them from self-organizing in harmful ways or spreading harmful instructions? Those are as-yet unanswered questions, but we need to figure them out quickly, because the agentic era is upon us, and things are moving very fast.\nBenj Edwards\nSenior AI Reporter\nBenj Edwards\nSenior AI Reporter\nBenj Edwards is Ars Technica's Senior AI Reporter and founder of the site's dedicated AI beat in 2022.

Most importantly, the test revealed NASA still has not fully resolved recurring hydrogen leaks that delayed the launch of the unpiloted Artemis I test flight by several months in 2022. Artemis I finally launched successfully after engineers revised their hydrogen loading procedures to overcome the leak.\nNow, the second Space Launch System (SLS) rocket is on the cusp of launching a crew for the first time. The Artemis II mission will send four astronauts inside NASA’s Orion spacecraft on a loop around the far side of the Moon on the first crewed lunar flight since 1972, paving the way for future expeditions to land humans at the Moon’s south pole.\nGoing into the countdown rehearsal, NASA officials hoped a smooth test would clear the way to launch the Artemis II mission as soon as Sunday, February 8. NASA has only a handful of launch opportunities for Artemis II each month, when the Moon is in the right location in its orbit to allow the Orion spacecraft to fly a so-called free return trajectory and come back to Earth for a safe reentry and splashdown.\nThe first launch opportunity for Artemis II next month is March 6, with a two-hour launch window opening at 8:29 pm EST (01:26 UTC on March 7).\nArtemis II commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, mission specialist Christina Koch, and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen have been in medical quarantine since January 21, a standard practice for astronauts preparing to fly to space. They will now be released from quarantine at their home base in Houston to resume training and await a new launch date.\nAn all-day roller coaster\nNASA’s Artemis launch team, stationed a few miles away from the SLS rocket on its seaside launch pad, started fueling operations around midday Monday, somewhat later than scheduled due to cold temperatures at the Florida spaceport. The launch team first detected leaking hydrogen soon after they began loading the super-cold fuel into the SLS core stage.\nThe leak appeared in the same location it did during the Artemis I launch campaign nearly three years ago. Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen flow from ground storage tanks into the SLS core stage through so-called Tail Service Mast Umbilicals (TSMUs), two roughly 30-foot-tall gray pods rising from the base of the rocket’s mobile launch platform. The TSMUs route propellant lines through connections near the bottom of the core stage, where umbilical plates on the rocket side and ground side meet. At liftoff, the umbilical plates disconnect as the rocket begins its climb off the launch pad.\nHydrogen is one of the most efficient rocket fuels, but it is notoriously difficult to handle. Liquified hydrogen must be stored at minus 423° Fahrenheit (minus 253° Celsius), cold enough to change the shape and size of seals and other soft goods in the fueling line. This can create leak paths not readily detectable at ambient temperatures. Hydrogen molecules are the smallest and lightest in the Universe, with the ability to find their way through the tiniest of breaches.\nBecause of this, NASA engineers accept that a small amount of hydrogen will escape seals in the fueling line. Agency officials said in 2022 that the safe limit was a 4 percent concentration of hydrogen gas in the housing around the fueling connector. Hydrogen levels exceeded NASA’s safety limit multiple times during the practice countdown that ran from Monday into early Tuesday.\nThis photo, taken in 2019, shows the liquid hydrogen Tail Service Mast Umbilical undergoing tests inside the Vehicle Assembly Building.

The connector plate is visible at the end of the arm in the center of the photo.\nCredit:\nNASA\n“ Attempts to resolve the issue involved stopping the flow of liquid hydrogen into the core stage, allowing the interface to warm up for the seals to reseat, and adjusting the flow of the propellant,” NASA said in a statement.\nNASA appeared to get past the problem Monday evening and fully loaded the 322-foot-tall (98-meter) rocket with more than 750,000 gallons of propellant.\nWith fueling complete, managers sent a closeout crew to the launch pad around 6 pm EST (23:00 UTC) to close the hatch to the Orion spacecraft sitting atop the SLS rocket. The closeout team will help the Artemis II astronauts into the Orion capsule on launch day, but the crew was not part of the practice countdown Monday night.\nThe closeout crew took longer than anticipated to close and secure the hatch to the Orion spacecraft. A valve associated with Orion’s hatch pressurization inadvertently vented, according to NASA, requiring the closeout crew to retorque the valve. The launch team dealt with several other glitches, including audio dropouts on ground communication loops and camera problems believed to be caused by recent cold weather in Central Florida.\nFinally, with the closeout crew a safe distance from the rocket, the launch team gave approval to begin the final 10 minutes of the countdown shortly after midnight Tuesday. The objective was to stop the countdown clock 33 seconds prior to launch, about the same time the rocket would take control of the countdown during a real launch attempt.\nInstead, the clock stopped at T-minus 5 minutes and 15 seconds. NASA said the countdown terminated “due to a spike in the liquid hydrogen leak rate.” The countdown ended before the rocket switched to internal power and fully pressurized its four propellant tanks. The test also concluded before the rocket activated its auxiliary power units to run the core stage’s four main engines through a preflight steering check, all milestones engineers hoped to cross off their checklist.\nLaunch controllers began work to drain the SLS rocket’s propellant tanks after calling an end to the countdown. With the test incomplete, NASA managers quickly decided to hold off on launching the Artemis II mission to allow time for ground teams to “fully review data from the test, mitigate each issue, and return to testing ahead of setting an official target launch date.”\n“As always, safety remains our top priority, for our astronauts, our workforce, our systems, and the public,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in a social media post. “We will only launch when we believe we are ready to undertake this historic mission.”\nOfficials did not immediately announce when they might be ready for a second wet dress rehearsal, or whether they plan to roll the rocket back to its assembly building for repairs. NASA managers plan to hold a press briefing Tuesday afternoon to discuss the results of the test in more detail.\nStephen Clark\nSpace Reporter\nStephen Clark\nSpace Reporter\nStephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering private space companies and the world’s space agencies.

But only the serious id Software nerds remember Catacomb 3D, id’s first-person adventure game that directly preceded and inspired work on Wolfenstein 3D.\nNow, nearly 35 years after Catacomb 3D‘s initial release, id co-founder John Romero brought the company’s founding members together for an informative retrospective video on the creation of the oft-forgotten game. But the pioneering game—which included mouse support, color-coded keys, and shooting walls to find secrets—almost ended up being a gimmicky dead end for the company.\nid Software’s founders look back at an oft-forgotten piece of gaming history.\nTexture maps and “undo” animation\nCatacomb 3D was a follow-up to id’s earlier Catacomb, which was a simplified clone of the popular arcade hit Gauntlet. As such, the 3D game still has some of that “quarter eater” mentality that was not very fashionable in PC gaming at the time, as John Carmack remembered.\n“It didn’t have the kind of overarching story and depth and the other things that people felt that the PC was better suited for,” Carmack said. “And we were still kind of striking out saying no, you know, action, fast, twitch, that still is a great viable gaming thing to do.”\nTechnologically, id wanted Catacomb 3D to build on the success of Hovertank One, a fast-paced first-person game the company had released a few months earlier. Catacomb 3D‘s major graphical breakthrough over Hovertank would be texture-mapped walls, a concept Carmack said he had been interested in since seeing a texture-mapped cube on the cover of his trusty copy of The Fundamentals of Computer Graphics.\nIf id wanted to update the flat-shaded walls of Hovertank One with texture maps for Catacomb 3D.\nRomero said he heard about texture mapping from a conversation with Paul Neurath, who was using the technique successfully in his work on the yet-to-be-released Ultima Underworld. Romero said he told Carmack about Neurath’s success, leading Carmack to pause for a second and then reply with “Yeah, I think I can do that.”\nCarmack said getting a “fully general” version of texture-mapped surfaces working was limited at the time to things like high-end SGI workstations. But he said he was able to develop “a simplification of that and could still go kind of fast” on the home PCs of the time. That was in part thanks to an EGA graphics trick that lets programmers write multiple columns of graphics data at a time.\n“When the walls are really tall, you can slap down as many as eight pixels at a time in some cases,” Carmack said.\nSample gameplay from Catacomb 3D showing the game’s texture-mapped surfaces.\nThe decision to go for a first-person viewpoint in Catacombs 3D, rather than an over-the-shoulder third-person system, was largely because “it was very costly to draw large things [like the player character] on screen,” id co-founder Tom Hall says in the video. But the first-person perspective also helped simplify aiming and added a real sense of immersion, he added. “This is me,” Hall said of the impact. “It really changes how you feel about things.”\nHall also reminisced about drawing extremely simplistic “6-year-old child-like drawings” to sketch out his concept for Catacomb 3D‘s characters, then giving them to Adrian Carmack for conversion into “majestic art pieces that stand the test of time.” Carmack, for his part, says he would “try to interpret [Hall’s drawings] as best I could” for the game’s 16-color, 320×200 resolution framework.\nAdrian Carmack also recalled working in DOS’s DeluxePaint II and not having access to any good animation software at the time. As such, he would end up using the drawing software’s undo command to flip back and forth between two different “frames” of animation quickly, to see how the movement would look in the final product. “If you use the undo key [like that], you learn really rapidly that you need to save often,” Carmack quipped in the video.\nNo longer keen on more Commander Keen\nWhile id’s decision to lean into fast, action-oriented first-person games might seem obvious in retrospect, the video reveals that it was far from an easy decision. Catacomb 3D earned the team just $5,000 (about $11,750 in December 2025 dollars) through a contract to deliver bi-monthly games for Softdisk’s Gamer’s Edge magazine-on-a-disk. Each episode of the Commander Keen series of run-and-gun 2D games, on the other hand, was still earning “10 times that amount” at the time, Romero said.\nThat made sticking with Commander Keen seem like the “obvious business decision,” Romero says in the video. The team even started work on a seventh Commander Keen game—with parallax scrolling and full VGA color support—right after Catacomb 3D‘s release. At the time, it felt like Catacomb 3D might be “just like a weird gimmick thing that we did for a little bit because we wanted to play with a different technology,” as John Carmack put it.\nA tech demo shows early work on Commander Keen 7 that was abandoned in favor of Wolfenstein 3D.\nThat feeling started to fade away, John Carmack said, after Adrian Carmack had an “almost falling out of his seat” moment while pivoting toward an in-game troll in Catacomb 3D. “It automatically sucked you in,” Adrian Carmack said of the feeling. “You’re trying to look behind walls, doors, whatever… you get a pop-out like that, and it was just one of the craziest things in a video game I had ever seen.”\nThat kind of reaction from one of their own eventually convinced the team to abandon two weeks of work on Keen 7 to focus on what would become Wolfenstein 3D. “It kind of felt [like] that’s where the future was going,” Carmack said in the video. “[We wanted to] “take it to some place that it wouldn’t happen staying in the existing conservative [lane].”\n“Within two weeks, [I was up] at one in the morning and I’m just like, ‘Guys, we need to not make this game [Keen],'” Romero told Ars in 2024. “‘This is not the future. The future is getting better at what we just did with Catacomb.’ … And everyone… immediately was like, ‘Yeah, you know, you’re right. That is the new thing, and we haven’t seen it, and we can do it, so why aren’t we doing it?’”\n[The original version of this story incorrectly suggested that John and Adrian Carmack were siblings.

Over the past six years, the service has raised prices for fans, and today, it announced that it’s increasing monthly subscription prices by up to 25 percent.\nSony bought Crunchyroll from AT&T in 2020. At the time, Crunchyroll had 3 million paid subscribers and an additional 197 million users with free accounts, which let people watch a limited number of titles with commercials. At the time, Crunchyroll monthly subscription tiers cost $8, $10, or $15.\nAfter its acquisition by Sony, like many large technology companies that buy a smaller, beloved product, the company made controversial changes. The Tokyo-based company folded rival Funimation into Crunchyroll; Sony shut down Funimation, which it bought in 2017, in April 2024.\nIn the process, Sony erased people’s digital Funimation libraries that Funimation originally marketed as being available “forever, but there are some restrictions.” Sony also reduced the number of free titles on Crunchyroll in 2022 before eliminating the free option completely on December 31, 2025.\nCrunchyroll gets more expensive\nToday, Crunchyroll raised prices for its remaining tiers. The cheapest plan, Fan, went from $8 per month to $10 per month. The Mega tier, which allows for streaming from up to four devices simultaneously, went from $12 to $14. The Ultra tier, which supports simultaneous streaming across six devices and includes access to the Crunchyroll Manga app, increased from $16 to $18.\nCurrent subscribers will see the changes after March 4. Crunchyroll is charging new customers the higher prices immediately.\nCrunchyroll last increased prices in May 2024, when its Mega tier went from $10 to $12 and its Ultimate tier from $15 to $16. The Fan tier’s last price hike was in 2019.\nCrunchyroll said that the higher prices would “give fans more of what they love.” Today’s announcement pointed to “recent and upcoming” changes: teen profiles and PIN protection; multiple profiles; the ability to skip intro theme songs and ending credits; and “expanded device compatibility.”\nStreaming consolidation\nCrunchyroll’s price hike may further frustrate subscribers, considering that the streaming service recently eliminated its free tier and acquired one of its strongest, and often cheaper, rivals. The result is that Crunchyroll and Netflix have the lion’s share of the anime streaming market. In 2023, Wall Street research firm Bernstein Research reported that Crunchyroll (40 percent) and Netflix (42 percent) controlled 82 percent of the overseas (non-Japanese) anime streaming market.\nAnime is an increasingly lucrative opportunity for Sony, and its success so far suggests it won’t stray from its strategy.\nFrom 2012 to 2024, Crunchyroll’s subscriber count grew from 5 million to over 15 million, per Variety. Sony hasn’t shared exact figures but has confirmed that Crunchyroll is profitable. In March, Bernstein Research analysts estimated that Crunchyroll’s profit margin was 8 percent in 2024’s third quarter and that the figure, as Variety put it, would “more than double by 2027.”\nCrunchyroll helped offset a 25 percent year-over-year drop in operating income for Sony’s Pictures segment in Sony’s most recent quarterly earnings report. During the quarter, streaming services represented 31 percent of sales for Sony Pictures, outpacing the segment’s theatrical, television, and home entertainment businesses.\nThe silver lining for anime and streaming viewers is that Crunchyroll is demonstrating that a niche service can scale and profit, and that when it does, it can add new experiences and further interest in its specialty. For its part, Crunchyroll recently relaunched its app for reading digital copies of manga. Crunchyroll shuttered its original Manga app in December 2023. The revived app uses an updated revenue-sharing model that’s said to better benefit publishers.\nStill, the changes that Sony makes to media companies it buys are worth scrutiny, especially as it continues acquiring companies. Sony-owned anime production company Aniplex announced that it bought rival Egg Firm today.\nAs streaming prices rise, industry consolidation is also picking up steam. If more large companies are buying and potentially merging streaming services, it will inevitably impact subscribers’ experiences. For these customers, it can be worrying to consider what changes streaming mergers can bring. While there’s hope for more features and content, there’s also risk for higher prices and fewer options.\nScharon Harding\nSenior Technology Reporter\nScharon Harding\nSenior Technology Reporter\nScharon is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica writing news, reviews, and analysis on consumer gadgets and services.

After that, “only verified and registered terminals will be allowed to operate in the country. All others will be disconnected,” the Ukraine Ministry of Defense said in a press release today.\nUkraine Minister of Defense Mykhailo Fedorov “emphasized that the only technical solution to counter this threat is to introduce a ‘whitelist’ and authorize all terminals,” according to the ministry. “This is a necessary step by the Government to save Ukrainian lives and protect critical energy infrastructure,” Fedorov said.\nFedorov has posted on SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s X social network a few times in the past few days about Russia’s use of Starlink and Ukraine’s attempt to counter it. On January 29, Fedorov said his agency contacted SpaceX hours after “reports that Russian drones equipped with Starlink connectivity were operating over Ukrainian cities.” Ukraine “proposed concrete ways to resolve the issue,” he said.\nFedorov said that SpaceX started working on a solution immediately after the outreach. Musk wrote yesterday, “Looks like the steps we took to stop the unauthorized use of Starlink by Russia have worked. Let us know if more needs to be done.”\nFedorov said yesterday that because of “the first steps taken in recent days, no Ukrainians have been killed by Russian drones using Starlink.” Fedorov said the ministry “will share instructions for Ukrainian users to register their Starlink terminals for verification” in the coming days, and that registration “will be simple, fast, and user-friendly.”\nUkraine’s whitelist plan will require residents to make “one visit to the nearest Administrative Services Center,” a process that Fedorov said will be “free, fast, and without excessive bureaucracy.” Businesses will be able to verify their Starlink terminals online, while the military and service members have separate systems for registration. Service members with personal Starlink terminals will “only need to add the terminal to the ‘whitelist’ to prevent disconnection.”\nRussia equipped “strike and reconnaissance” drones with Starlink\nSpaceX has provided Ukraine with Starlink access since Russia invaded in 2022. There are limits to this agreement, as SpaceX has taken steps to prevent Ukraine’s military from using Starlink with drones. SpaceX uses geofencing to limit Starlink access, and Musk said in February 2024 that “Starlink satellites will not close the link in Russia.”\nRussia has obtained Starlink terminals through black market sales, evading US sanctions. A document on the US Army’s Operational Environment Data Integration Network website says that as of December 2025, “Russian units have begun equipping both strike and reconnaissance variants of the Molniya-2 drone with commercial Starlink satellite communication terminals. This modification enables control and data transmission beyond line-of-sight constraints, significantly increasing operational resilience against conventional electronic warfare countermeasures and facilitating precision targeting at extended ranges.”\nUkrainian forces previously “developed effective countermeasures against standard Molniya-2 drones,” using their own interceptor drones to jam frequencies used for control systems, the document said. But newer versions are harder to counter.\n“However, the integration of Starlink terminals in newer variants largely neutralizes these conventional electronic warfare methods, creating a substantial tactical challenge for Ukrainian air defense systems,” the document said. “Since its introduction to the battlefield, the Molniya-2 has demonstrated high effectiveness, in part due to its simple design. Russian forces have reported numerous successful strikes against Ukrainian personnel, armored vehicles, military facilities, and logistics infrastructure across various sectors of the conflict.”\nThe new reconnaissance variant of the drone uses a “Raspberry Pi 5 microcomputer; Chinese Mini PC F8 running licensed Windows 11 (rebranded in Russia as ‘Raskat’); SIYI ZR10 camera featuring 10-fold optical zoom and three-axis stabilization; [and] Starlink satellite communication terminal for video relay and telemetry transmission,” the document says. Although Russia has been adding advanced equipment to the drones, the drones themselves have an “intentionally rudimentary design [that] emphasizes affordability and mass production over technological sophistication.”\nJon Brodkin\nSenior IT Reporter\nJon Brodkin\nSenior IT Reporter\nJon is a Senior IT Reporter for Ars Technica.

Trump himself has repeatedly made false statements about the cost of wind power, its use around the world, and its environmental impacts. That animosity was paired with an executive order that blocked all permitting for offshore wind and some land-based projects, an order that has since been thrown out by a court that ruled it arbitrary and capricious.\nNot content to block all future developments, the administration has also gone after the five offshore wind projects currently under construction. After temporarily blocking two of them for reasons that were never fully elaborated, the Department of the Interior settled on a single justification for blocking turbine installation: a classified national security risk.\nThe response to that late-December announcement has been uniform: The companies building each of the projects sued the administration. As of Monday, every single one of them has achieved the same result: a temporary injunction that allows them to continue construction. This, despite the fact that the suits were filed in three different courts and heard by four different judges.\nBased on reporting elsewhere, some of the judges viewed the classified report that was used to justify the order to halt construction, but they didn’t find it persuasive. In one case, the judge noted that the government wasn’t acting as if the security risks were real. The threat supposedly comes from the operation of the wind turbines, but the Department of the Interior’s order blocked construction while allowing any completed hardware to operate.\n“If the government’s concern is the operation of these facilities, allowing the ongoing operation of the 44 turbines while prohibiting the repair of the existing turbines and the completion of the 18 additional turbines is irrational,” Judge Brian E. Murphy said. That once again raises the possibility that the order halting construction will ultimately be held to be arbitrary and capricious.\nFor now, however, the courts are largely offering the wind projects relief because the ruling was issued without any warning or communication from the government and would clearly inflict substantial harm on the companies building them. The injunction blocks the government’s hold on construction until a final ruling is issued. The government can still appeal the decision before that point, but the consistency among these rulings suggests it will likely fail.\nSeveral of these projects are near completion and are likely to be done before any government appeal can be heard.\nJohn Timmer\nSenior Science Editor\nJohn Timmer\nSenior Science Editor\nJohn is Ars Technica's science editor.

Scientists at the University of Utah have analyzed human hair samples spanning nearly 100 years and found a 100-fold decrease in lead concentrations, concluding that this regulatory action was highly effective in achieving its stated objectives. They described their findings in a new paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nWe’ve known about the dangers of lead exposure for a very long time—arguably since the second century BCE—so why conduct this research now? Per the authors, it’s because there are growing concerns over the Trump administration’s move last year to deregulate many key elements of the EPA’s mission. Lead specifically has not yet been deregulated, but there are hints that there could be a loosening of enforcement of the 2024 Lead and Cooper rule requiring water systems to replace old lead pipes.\n“We should not forget the lessons of history. And the lesson is those regulations have been very important,” said co-author Thure Cerling. “Sometimes they seem onerous and mean that industry can’t do exactly what they’d like to do when they want to do it or as quickly as they want to do it. But it’s had really, really positive effects.”\nAn American mechanical and chemical engineer named Thomas Midgley Jr. was a key player in the development of leaded gasoline (tetraethyl lead) because it was an excellent anti-knock agent, as well as the first chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) like freon. Midgley publicly defended the safety of tetraethyl lead (TEL), despite experiencing lead poisoning firsthand. He held a 1924 press conference during which he poured TEL on his hand and inhaled TEL vapor for 60 seconds, claiming no ill effects. It was probably just a coincidence that he later took a leave of absence from work because of lead poisoning. (Midgley’s life ended in tragedy: he was severely disabled by polio in 1940 and devised an elaborate rope-and-pulley system to get in and out of bed. That system ended up strangling him to death in 1944, and the coroner ruled it suicide.)\nScience also produced a hero in this saga: Caltech geochemist Clair Patterson. Along with George Tilton, Patterson developed a lead-dating method and used it to calculate the age of the Earth (4.55 billion years), based on analysis of the Canyon Diablo meteorite. And he soon became a leading advocate for banning leaded gasoline and the “leaded solder” used in canned foods. This put Patterson at odds with some powerful industry lobbies, for which he paid a professional price.\nBut his many experimental findings on the extent of lead contamination and its toxic effects ultimately led to the rapid phase-out of lead in all standard automotive gasolines. Prior to the EPA’s actions in the 1970s, most gasolines contained about 2 grams of lead per gallon, which quickly adds up to nearly 2 pounds of lead released via automotive exhaust into the environment, per person, every year.\nThe proof is in our hair\nThe US Mining and Smelting Co. plant in Midvale, Utah, 1906.\nCredit:\nUtah Historical Society\nThe US Mining and Smelting Co. plant in Midvale, Utah, 1906.\nCredit:\nUtah Historical Society\nLead can linger in the air for several days, contaminating one’s lungs, accumulating in living tissue, and being absorbed by one’s hair. Cerling had previously developed techniques to determine where animals lived and their diet by analyzing hair and teeth. Those methods proved ideal for analyzing hair samples from Utah residents who had previously participated in an earlier study that sampled their blood.\nThe subjects supplied hair samples both from today and when they were very young; some were even able to provide hair preserved in family scrapbooks that had belonged to their ancestors. The Utah population is well-suited for such a study because the cities of Midvale and Murray were home to a vibrant smelting industry through most of the 20th century; most other smelters in the region closed down in the 1970s when the EPA cracked down on using lead in consumer products.\nCerling acknowledged that blood would have been even better for assessing lead exposure, but hair samples are much easier to collect. “[Hair] doesn’t really record that internal blood concentration that your brain is seeing, but it tells you about that overall environmental exposure,” he said. “One of the things that we found is that hair records that original value, but then the longer the hair has been exposed to the environment, the higher the lead concentrations are.”\n“The surface of the hair is special,” said co-author Diego Fernandez. “We can tell that some elements get concentrated and accumulated in the surface. Lead is one of those. That makes it easier because lead is not lost over time. Because mass spectrometry is very sensitive, we can do it with one hair strand, though we cannot tell where the lead is in the hair. It’s probably in the surface mostly, but it could be also coming from the blood if that hair was synthesized when there was high lead in the blood.”\nThe authors found very high levels of lead in hair samples dating from around 1916 to 1969. But after the 1970s, lead concentrations in the hair samples they analyzed dropped steeply, from highs of 100 parts per million (ppm) to 10 PPM by 1990, and less than 1 ppm by 2024. Those declines largely coincide with the lead reductions in gasoline that began after President Nixon established the EPA in 1970. The closing of smelting facilities likely also contributed to the decline. “This study demonstrates the effectiveness of environmental regulations controlling the emissions of pollutants,” the authors concluded.\nPNAS, 2026.

The 2GB boards’ pricing will go up by $10, 4GB boards will go up by $15, 8GB boards will go up by $30, and 16GB boards will increase by a whopping $60.\nThese increases stack on top of across-the-board $5 to $15 price hikes implemented for most Pi 4 and 5 models in December, and a handful of more contained price hikes for select models in early October. The 16GB version of the Pi 5 will now cost a whopping $205. The 8GB versions of the Pi 4 and 5 will run you $125 and $135, respectively, the only other boards to climb above $100.\nPricing for the 1GB versions of the Pi 4 and Pi 5 isn’t changing, at least not for now—they’ll continue to be available for $35 and $45, respectively. Pricing is also staying level for the Pi 400 computer. Older models that use LPDDR2, like the Pi 3 and the Pi Zero, will also stick around at their current prices.\nThe Raspberry Pi initially rose to prominence not because it was a cutting-edge computer, but because it offered a complete tinkerer-friendly system for just $35. At this point, the Pi has been around long enough that the robust ecosystem of operating system distributions, applications, and scripts is part of what you’re paying for, but the higher the price climbs, the more attractive things like no-name x86-based mini PCs or used PCs become. During the last widespread Pi shortages in 2022 and 2023, some users turned to old thin client PCs for the kinds of simple appliance-like hobby projects that the Pi is often recommended for.\nUpton says the company intends to bring prices back down when memory pricing comes down enough to make it possible.\n“The current situation is ultimately a temporary one,” Upton writes, “and we look forward to unwinding these price increases once it abates.”\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\nAndrew Cunningham\nSenior Technology Reporter\nAndrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with a focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of operating systems like Windows and macOS.

The judge overseeing the case determined that the government tried to treat the Climate Working Group as a formal advisory body, while not having it obey many of the statutory requirements that govern such bodies.\nWhile the Department of Energy (DOE) later disbanded the Climate Working Group in the hopes of avoiding legal scrutiny, documents obtained during the proceedings have now revealed the group’s electronic communications. As such, the judge ruled that the trial itself had essentially overcome the government’s illegal attempts to hide those communications.\nLegal and scientific flaws\nThe whole saga derives from a Supreme Court Ruling that compelled the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to evaluate the risks posed to the US public by greenhouse gases. During the Obama administration, this resulted in an endangerment finding that created the foundation for the EPA to regulate carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act. The science underlying the endangerment finding was so solid that it was left unchallenged during the first Trump administration.\nBut the second Trump administration is forging ahead with an attempt to undo it regardless. To give that attempt a veneer of scientific credibility ahead of its inevitable challenge in the court system, the DOE gathered a group of prominent climate contrarians, secure in the knowledge that this group would produce a report that raised lots of spurious issues with the scientific understanding of climate change. And that’s exactly what happened, prompting the scientific community to organize a review that highlighted the report’s extensive flaws.\nBut the flaws weren’t limited to scientific deficiencies. Two advocacy organizations, the Environmental Defense Fund and Union of Concerned Scientists, sued, alleging that the Climate Working Group violated various provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. This requires that any groups formed to provide the government with advice must be fairly balanced and keep records that are open to the public. The Climate Working Group, by contrast, operated in secret; in fact, emails obtained during the trial showed that its members were advised to use private emails to limit public scrutiny of their communications.\nIn response, the DOE dissolved the Climate Working Group in order to claim that the legal issues were moot, as the advisory committee at issue in the suit no longer existed.\nNo defense\nIn court, the government initially argued that the Federal Advisory Committee Act didn’t apply, claiming that the Climate Working Group was simply organized to provide information to the government. Based on Friday’s ruling, however, once the court tried to consider that issue, the government shifted to simply arguing that the Climate Working Group no longer existed, so none of this mattered. “The Defendants, in their Opposition and subsequent filings, ignore the allegations relating to the [Federal Advisory Committee Act] violations themselves,” the judge states. “Rather, the Defendants argue only that these claims are moot because the Climate Working Group has been dissolved.”\nSo, the court was left with little more than the accusations that the Climate Working Group had a membership with biased opinions, failed to hold open meetings, and did not keep public records. Given the lack of opposing arguments, “These violations are now established as a matter of law.”\nBut the ruling also determined that the lawsuit itself has provided a solution to some of the government’s violations. As part of court proceedings, the government was compelled to hand over all of the Climate Working Group’s emails, including the ones sent to private accounts. Those have now been placed online by the Environmental Defense Fund. As a result, the Climate Working Group’s deliberations are now public, as the law had required.\nWhat do the emails reveal? The Climate Working Group was organized by a political appointee at the DOE (one who was previously at the libertarian Cato Institute) and done with the intention of producing material that would aid the EPA with overturning the greenhouse gas endangerment finding. The group recognized that its members’ opinions were outside of the mainstream, but they viewed most mainstream scientists as hopelessly biased and generally ascribed that to their political views.\nThere was some talk of having the group’s report peer-reviewed, motivated by an executive order naming that a necessary component of “gold standard science.” That discussion largely focused on thinking about scientists who shared their views and would give it a favorable review. That said, some DOE staff members reviewed the document and highlighted some of the same flaws identified by the scientific community; the Climate Working Group largely ignored these criticisms.\nOverall, none of what the suit revealed is a surprise to anyone who paid attention to the Climate Working Group. But the issues highlighted in the suit and the emails it revealed may ultimately be significant. There has been reporting that the attempt to reverse the endangerment finding is on hold because of concerns that the scientific case for doing so is too weak, as the DOE reviewers noted in the comments. And if it ever ends up in court, the legal invalidation of the Climate Working Group may play a significant role.\nJohn Timmer\nSenior Science Editor\nJohn Timmer\nSenior Science Editor\nJohn is Ars Technica's science editor.

The New York Times reported yesterday that it found “nearly 40 unredacted images that appeared to be part of a personal photo collection, showing both nude bodies and the faces of the people portrayed.”\nWhile the people in the photos were young, “it was unclear whether they were minors,” the article said. “Some of the images seemed to show Mr. Epstein’s private island, including a beach. Others were taken in bedrooms and other private spaces.” The photos “appeared to show at least seven different people,” the article said.\nThe Times said it notified government officials of the nude images and that the pictures have since been “largely removed or redacted” from the files available on the DOJ website. The DOJ told the Times and other media outlets that it is making “additional redactions of personally identifiable information” and redactions of “images of a sexual nature. Once proper redactions have been made, any responsive documents will repopulate online.”\nA DOJ spokesperson told Ars today that the department “takes victim protection very seriously and has redacted thousands of victims’ names in the millions of published pages to protect the innocent. The Department had 500 reviewers looking at millions of pages for this very reason, to meet the requirements of the act while protecting victims. When a victim’s name is alleged to be unredacted, our team is working around the clock to fix the issue and republish appropriately redacted pages as soon as possible. To date, 0.1 percent of released pages have been found to have victim identifying information unredacted.”\nThe 0.1 percent figure is apparently an increase since yesterday, presumably because of more reports of incomplete redactions in the past day. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told ABC News yesterday that “every time we hear from a victim or their lawyer that they believe that their name was not properly redacted, we immediately rectify that. And the numbers we’re talking about, just so the American people understand, we’re talking about .001 percent of all the materials.”\nImages “stayed online for at least another full day”\n404 Media reported that it sent the DOJ links to nude images from the DOJ’s website and that the “files stayed online for at least another full day, until Sunday evening, when they disappeared.”\nSeparately, The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that the files included full names of victims, “including many who haven’t shared their identities publicly or were minors when they were abused by the notorious sex offender. A review of 47 victims’ full names on Sunday found that 43 of them were left unredacted in files that were made public by the government on Friday… Several women’s full names appeared more than 100 times in the files.”\nThe Journal said its review found that over two dozen names of minor victims were exposed. “Their full names were available Sunday afternoon in the Justice Department’s keyword search, along with personally identifying details that make them readily traceable, including home addresses,” the article said.\nAnouska de Georgiou, an Epstein victim who testified against Ghislaine Maxwell, “said she contacted the Justice Department this weekend after learning that her personal information was made public in the release, including a picture of her driver’s license,” the Journal wrote.\nDOJ said it made “all reasonable efforts”\nBrad Edwards, an attorney for Epstein victims, told ABC News that “we are getting constant calls for victims because their names, despite them never coming forward, being completely unknown to the public, have all just been released for public consumption… It’s literally thousands of mistakes.” Edwards said the government should “take the thing down for now” instead of trying to fix the problems piecemeal.\nThe DOJ said Friday that the release includes more than 3 million pages, including over 2,000 videos and 180,000 images. The agency said it used “an additional review protocol” to comply with a court order requiring that no victim-identifying information be included unredacted in the public release.\n“These files were collected from five primary sources including the Florida and New York cases against Epstein, the New York case against Maxwell, the New York cases investigating Epstein’s death, the Florida case investigating a former butler of Epstein, multiple FBI investigations, and the Office of Inspector General investigation into Epstein’s death,” the DOJ said.\nThe DOJ’s Epstein files webpage carries a disclaimer on the potential release of images or names that should have been redacted. “In view of the Congressional deadline, all reasonable efforts have been made to review and redact personal information pertaining to victims, other private individuals, and protect sensitive materials from disclosure. That said, because of the volume of information involved, this website may nevertheless contain information that inadvertently includes non-public personally identifiable information or other sensitive content, to include matters of a sexual nature,” it says.\nThe DOJ’s Epstein webpage advised that members of the public can email EFTA@usdoj.gov to report materials that should not have been included.\nLawyer: DOJ put onus on victims to review files\nAnnie Farmer, who testified that she was 16 years old when Epstein and Maxwell abused her in 1996, told the Times that “it’s hard to imagine a more egregious way of not protecting victims than having full nude images of them available for the world to download.” Farmer is now a psychologist.\nThe DOJ told ABC News in a statement that it “coordinated closely with victims and their lawyers to ensure that the production of documents includes necessary redactions,” and wants to “immediately correct any redaction errors that our team may have made.”\nEdwards and Brittany Henderson, who are partners at the same law firm, “said they provided a list of 350 victims to the Justice Department on Dec. 4 to ensure that the names would be redacted ahead of the release,” according to The Wall Street Journal. “They said Sunday that they are alarmed that the government didn’t perform a basic keyword search of victim names to verify the success of its redaction process.”\nEdwards said he contacted Justice Department officials on Friday. “We notified them of the problem within an hour of the release,” Edwards was quoted as saying. “It’s been acknowledged as a grave error; there is no excuse for failing to immediately remedy it unless it was done intentionally.”\nEdwards said the DOJ is putting the onus on victims to comb through millions of files and submit redaction requests. “In some cases, he said individuals have had to locate and submit more than 100 links to the DOJ to request that their names be redacted,” the Journal wrote.\nJon Brodkin\nSenior IT Reporter\nJon Brodkin\nSenior IT Reporter\nJon is a Senior IT Reporter for Ars Technica.

He has over 20 years experience in AV, and has previously been on staff at Digital Trends and Reviewed.The Super Bowl is not only one of the biggest sporting events in the world, it’s also one of the best times of year to find a deal on a big TV. For major events in particular, a large TV makes sense because it provides a more immersive experience and allows for groups of friends to gather and enjoy the game together. And as interest in big TVs grows, the prices continue to come down, making them more accessible than ever — especially during sales you’ll find this week.Which TV is best for you and your space will depend on a few factors: how much light is in your room, how big of a TV can you accommodate, what your viewing habits are (beyond the Super Bowl), and of course what your budget is. But luckily there are plenty of good TVs in different sizes and price ranges to choose from.Samsung S95F$1898$219814% off$1898$1898 at Amazon (55-inch)$2300 at Best Buy (65-inch)$2298 at Amazon (65-inch)There are a few reasons why the S95F is one of the best TVs you can get for game day. It’s more than bright enough to stand up to ambient light that might be streaming in through windows or from lamps and ceiling lights, plus it has a glare-free matte finish that significantly mitigates reflections. So, you’ll be able to keep the lights on to see your food and drink and reflections won’t get in the way of seeing any on-screen action. The S95F is a QD-OLED that has excellent color accuracy and vibrancy that will make the field and the players look realistic, and the OLED technology allows for wide viewing angles, keeping the image consistent for you and your friends no matter who is relegated to the edge seats.Since it is a flagship TV, the Samsung S95F isn’t the cheapest on this list — the 65-inch model is on sale for $2,297.99 at Amazon — but it’s one of the best TVs on the market. Although, Samsung’s built-in OS Tizen is not the most intuitive, with some useful features buried in the menus. Still, if you have a room that gets a bunch of sun during the day, but want an OLED movie experience at night, the Samsung S95F delivers.LG C5 OLED TV$1397$270048% off$1397LG’s midrange C5 TV is an excellent way to get OLED performance without paying top dollar. It has a good amount of brightness, excellent color accuracy out of the box, and great gaming features including 4K @ 144Hz.Read More$1397 at Amazon (65-inch)$1400 at Best Buy (65-inch)LG’s C5 is its midrange OLED line, and is one that I’ve been recommending for years. As an OLED with pixel-level brightness control, it boasts excellent black levels and color accuracy. It doesn’t match the S95F in terms of brightness output, and it has a glossy screen finish so reflections might be distracting if you’re in a room with a lot of light, but its picture quality is fantastic. You can also get more screen size for less money when compared to the Samsung, with the 65-inch model currently available for just under $1,400.The C4, LG’s 2024 C-series model, can also still be found on sale (An Amazon seller has the 65-inch for $1,176.95). While it’s a year older than the C5, there isn’t a drastic difference between the two models. Yes, it’s not quite as bright as the C5, but if you don’t have a problem with ambient light and you want something that offers great picture quality, deep blacks, and accurate colors out of the box, it’s worth the consideration.TCL QM7K$998$200050% off$998TCL’s midrange QM7K has a QD-Mini LED TV with a 144Hz refresh rate, hundreds of local dimming zones for more precise brightness controls, and a Bang & Olufsen audio system.Read More$998 at Amazon (75-inch)$998 at Walmart (75-inch)$1000 at Best Buy (75-inch)The QM7K is TCL’s midrange quantum dot mini-LED TV and is a great way to get a bigger screen into your living room without spending too much. Right now the 75-inch model is available for only $999.99 at Best Buy, and a couple bucks cheaper at Amazon and Walmart. With the 2025 model year, TCL made improvements to its blooming control, so the QM7K handles that better than previous models, as well as preventing light from bright images bleeding distractingly into dark areas of the screen. The QM7K uses an HVA panel that helps with its viewing angles, although it doesn’t match the performance of an OLED.There are also some great deals for the more budget-friendly model, the QM6K (you can get an extra 10 inches of screen size for the same price as the 75-inch QM7K), but its brightness is not nearly as good as the QM7K, so the image won’t have the same impact. If you really want more screen and aren’t worried about brightness, the QM6K will do the job, but I think it’s worth the extra cost to bump up to the QM7K instead.Hisense U7QG TV$2198$500056% off$2198Hisense U7QG TVRead More$2198 at Amazon (100-inch)$2200 at Best Buy (100-inch)For the past few years, Hisense has been offering big deals on big TVs for the Super Bowl, and this year is no different. If you want a truly huge TV, the 100-inch Hisense U75QG is available for just under $2,200 at both Best Buy and Amazon. That’s less than the 65-inch Samsung S95F for an extra 35 inches of diagonal screen real estate. The U75QG is also the brightest TV on this list — hitting nearly 3,000 nits of brightness in small highlights — so there’s no issue with it holding its own against any ambient light. It looks really good out of the box with SDR signals (the vast majority of broadcast TV), so Levi’s Stadium will look realistic. And with a 100-inch screen, the game (and the commercials) will be incredibly engaging.Once the game is done, the U75QG serves as a great everyday TV with good black levels and gaming support with 4K support at up to 165Hz refresh rate. Its HDR color isn’t as accurate as SDR (it tends a little towards blue as the picture gets brighter), but it will still perform well with movies and regular viewing.Verge DealsSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

HawkinsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All by Andrew J. Hawkins is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.On Monday, Elon Musk announced that he was merging two of his companies, SpaceX and xAI, in a deal said to be worth $1.25 trillion. The reason, Musk said in an announcement, was that in order for AI to grow, it needed to go to space.AI relies on “large terrestrial data centers” that run on “immense amounts of power and cooling,” he said, which comes at great expense to the environment and community opposition. The solution: data centers in space. “In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale,” Musk said.Musk isn’t the only one looking to launch data centers into orbit. Google has Project Suncatcher to build solar-powered AI data centers in space. China is looking into space-based data centers, as is Europe. As we reported last year, space-based data centers — in the form of satellites with solar panels — are Big Tech’s latest fad and Silicon Valley’s newest investable venture.On the surface, it sounds like a logical solution to the unique problem presented by power-hungry data centers. Local communities are rising up against data center projects over concerns about electricity demand, water usage, and rising utility rates. Launching those data centers into space means they are not taking up any space on Earth, and in a sun-synchronous orbit there is the availability of solar energy.AI relies on “large terrestrial data centers” that run on “immense amounts of power and cooling,” Musk said, which comes at great expense to the environmentBut there’s another, simpler way of looking at Musk’s merger: SpaceX is profitable, and xAI is not. Not only is xAI not profitable, it’s in the midst of a serious cash burn as it races to compete with well-financed rivals like Google and OpenAI. As Bloomberg recently reported, the AI company is burning about $1 billion a month as it spends heavily to build data centers, recruit talent, and run the social media platform X.Meanwhile, SpaceX generated about $8 billion in profit on an estimated $16 billion of revenue ​last year, Reuters reported. The main revenue driver is Starlink, which accounts for up to 80 percent of the company’s revenue. Since 2019, SpaceX has launched over 9,500 satellites and boasts up to 9 million broadband internet users. The company is also a major government contractor, having secured over $20 billion in NASA and Defense Department deals since 2008. When it goes public later this year, SpaceX is expected to raise up to $50 billion in investment.Meanwhile, xAI has it own government tie-ups. The Department of Defense is using Grok, in addition to other chatbots, to analyze information that flows through its military intelligence networks.It’s not clear how investors will feel about merging the cash-burning xAI with the profitable SpaceX. But it’s important to note that Musk has done this before, when he merged the debt-ridden SolarCity with Tesla in 2016. Since Musk was the largest shareholder and chairman of both Tesla and SolarCity, shareholders sued to block the merger, alleging it was a $2.6 billion “bailout” of a cash-strapped, struggling company. Musk eventually won the lawsuit, with a judge ruling that he did not force Tesla to overpay for SolarCity.Musk now faces a new lawsuit from Tesla shareholders over his creation of xAI. The lawsuit alleges that Musk breached his fiduciary duty to Tesla by forming xAI, which competes with the automaker for AI talent, resources, and Musk’s attention. The news that SpaceX is acquiring xAI certainly won’t settle those concerns; if anything, it makes it more chaotic and complex.So where does this all leave Tesla? In the most recent earnings report, Tesla said it was investing $2 billion into xAI “to enhance Tesla’s ability to develop and deploy AI products and services into the physical world at scale.” Grok, xAI’s chatbot that’s currently under investigation in multiple countries for generating nonconsensual sexualized images of people, including children, was recently integrated into certain Tesla vehicles as a voice assistant. Grok also lags behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, and other large language models in several key metrics.Data centers in space is pure Musk futurism that has no guarantee of success. It’s not as simple as just strapping a GPU to a rocket and hitting “launch.” First off, GPUs are total power hogs. Unless you’ve got a nuclear reactor floating up there, you’re going to need a massive solar arrays to power it. Then there’s the communication situation; even if you’re hitching a ride on Starlink, you still have to figure out the budget for sending info back and forth to Earth. Eventually, the numbers start to look pretty scary.Musk says merging SpaceX and xAI is the way to make it happen. And perhaps one day he’ll take the suggestion of bullish investors to combine all his companies, including Tesla, Neuralink, and the Boring Company, into one massive, Musk-run mega-corporation: Musk Inc., if you will. How will Tesla shareholders react?“Tesla is Musk’s liquid piggy bank, since it’s publicly traded; his other companies are not,” Tesla investor James McRitchie said during a prevote presentation before the company’s 2024 shareholder meeting, according to The Wall Street Journal. “Either he sticks around long enough to use our shareholder capital to fund his other ventures, or he shifts his attention sooner if we reject his pay package and turn off the money tap.”Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew J.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.Microsoft says it is working on the Publisher Content Marketplace (PCM), an AI licensing hub that shows usage terms set by publishers. That way, AI companies can easily shop the terms and set up deals to use online content for “grounding” their AI models, while the content owners get usage-based reporting to help set prices.Microsoft says it’s been codesigning PCM with companies including Verge parent Vox Media, The Associated Press, Condé Nast, People, and others. The AI boom has been largely fueled by content ingested without payment, and many of the previously mentioned publishers have filed lawsuits and/or arranged content licensing deals as traffic from traditional sources drops. Some, like The New York Times and The Intercept, have filed copyright lawsuits against both Microsoft and OpenAI.There’s also a publisher-backed open standard called Really Simple Licensing (RSL) that lays out a framework aimed at keeping the digital media business sustainable in the age of AI. It builds licensing terms into a publisher’s website, dictating how bots should pay to scrape their sites.When asked about how, or if, that could interact with the PCM, Microsoft spokesperson Courtney Ramirez says the company plans “to work closely with publishing partners as we build this pilot experience,” but doesn’t have “anything specific to share today.”RelatedA pay-to-scrape AI licensing standard is now officialMeta strikes AI licensing deals with CNN, Fox News, and USA TodayAccording to Microsoft, with this setup, “publishers will be paid on delivered value, and AI builders gain scalable access to licensed premium content that improves their products.” The company adds that PCM will “support publishers of all sizes,” including large organizations and independent publications.“The open web was built on an implicit value exchange where publishers made content accessible, and distribution channels — like search — helped people find it,” Microsoft writes. “That model does not translate cleanly to an AI-first world, where answers are increasingly delivered in a conversation.”Microsoft says it has started to onboard partners, including Yahoo, as it continues piloting the marketplace and is looking to expand further.Update, February 3rd: Added a response from Microsoft.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma RothCloseEmma RothNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All by Emma RothAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All AIMicrosoftCloseMicrosoftPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All MicrosoftNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularElon Musk merges SpaceX with xAI (and X)How to tear gas childrenThe tragedy of SupernaturalFirefox is adding a switch to turn AI features offAdobe Animate is shutting down next monthThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Purchasing a new MacBook can be complicated if you’re trying to figure out what specs you need, but finding a deal on a relatively speedy model is surprisingly easy, especially since Apple increased the starting RAM on several models in late 2024 and hasn’t stopped.In this articleFeatured ProductsThe best MacBook Air dealsThe best MacBook Pro dealsThe best Mac Mini dealsThese days, it’s not uncommon to see various MacBooks discounted by up to $800, although the quality of deals fluctuates frequently. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain configurations of older models as Apple continues to move forward with newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store offers a one-year warranty and generally discounts new units by up to 20 percent.RelatedThe best laptops you can getUpgraded MacBook Pros could be just around the cornerI tested a bunch of gaming laptops and these are the bestBut if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.Featured ProductsPreviousNext13-inch MacBook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)Read More$849 at Amazon (midnight color)$999 at Best BuyMacBook Pro 14-inch (M5, 2025)Apple’s latest laptop is $64 offRead More$1449 at Amazon (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)$1600 at Amazon (16GB RAM, 1TB SSD)Apple MacBook Pro 16 (2024, M4 Pro)Read More$2240 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)$2250 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)Apple Mac Mini (M4)Read More$549 at Amazon (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)$549 at B&H Photo (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)The best MacBook Air dealsM4 MacBook AirIn March 2025, Apple released an updated MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with an M4 processor. Interestingly, the latest Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a fresh sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. Needless to say, there’s a lot to like.RelatedApple MacBook Air M4 review: a little more for a little lessIntel could finally return to Apple computers in 2027The 13- and 15-inch MacBook Airs have both previously received sizable discounts, though there aren’t any notable deals happening right now. That said, you can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, an eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale at Amazon for $849 ($150 off) if you want the midnight model, or around $949 for other color schemes. The lowest price we’ve seen for this model takes $200 off the original cost. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for about $1,049 ($150 off) at Amazon in the midnight color, which is decent but not as good as the $999 sale price that was around for months. Other colors are $50 to $100 more.13-inch MacBook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)$849$99915% off$849$849 at Amazon (midnight color)15-inch MacBook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)$1050$119912% off$1050$1050 at Amazon$1099 at Best BuyThe best MacBook Pro dealsM4 and M4 Pro MacBook ProIn November 2024, Apple released the M4-series MacBook Pro. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is open. Also new in this model is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.RelatedThe M4 MacBook Pro features a quantum dot displayApple removed a Night mode photo feature from the iPhone 17 ProThe 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View, as well as the optional nano-texture display option.As of right now, the M4 Pro-equipped MacBook Pro is the only model receiving significant discounts. For example, the 14-inch M4 Pro with a 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is available at Amazon starting at $1,749.99 ($300 off). It’s a solid discount, even if it’s not the biggest price drop we’ve seen in recent months.The base 16-inch MacBook Pro, meanwhile, is available with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,239 ($260 off) at Amazon or $2,249 at Best Buy, which is around $120 more than the all-time low we saw during Black Friday.14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro$1749$249930% off$1749$1749 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)$1999 at Adorama (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)Apple MacBook Pro 16 (2024, M4 Pro)$2240$249910% off$2240$2240 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)$2249 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)M5 MacBook ProApple’s latest revision of the 14.2-inch MacBook Pro adds the M5 processor. The generational leap will be felt most by those who have an older MacBook Pro, not those upgrading from the M4, unless you use specific AI apps that tap into the chip’s new Neural Accelerators. As for other design changes and upgrades to the inside and outside of this MacBook Pro, there really aren’t any major ones to note; in fact, it’s so similar to the M4 model that our reviewer Antonio Di Benedetto had to write “M5” on a sticky note just to be able to tell them apart. That being said, it’s still an amazing laptop, one that’s just now starting to get minor discounts.The 14.2-inch base model with the M5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is down to $1,449 ($150 off) at Amazon, which is $100 shy of its best price to date. It’s worth picking over the M4 MacBook Pro, especially since that model currently costs more than the newer, better version.MacBook Pro 14-inch (M5, 2025)$1449$15999% off$1449$1449 at Amazon (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)The best Mac Mini dealsThe newest Mac Minis in town are the M4-based models, which arrived in late 2024. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint of its desktop and paired it with its M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.M4 and M4 Pro Mac MiniDeals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.In addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.RelatedThis Mac Mini Kensington security lock makes sure it can’t escapeThe best iPhonesIn the past, we’ve seen the base Mac Mini drop to as low as $469, but right now it’s on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $549 ($50 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $729 ($70 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.

Stevie started out at Laptop Mag writing news and reviews on hardware, gaming, and AI.A raid on X’s Paris office was carried out by the Paris prosecutor’s cybercrime unit on Tuesday with Europol and French police as part of an ongoing investigation that expanded in July to include Grok. As previously reported by Reuters, Elon Musk and former X CEO Linda Yaccarino were also summoned for hearings in April.The investigation, which was initially launched last year, is looking into several allegations against X and Grok, including complicity in possession and distribution of child pornography and denial of crimes against humanity (related to Holocaust denial content), along with claims that X was manipulating its algorithm and illegally extracting data.On Tuesday, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) also announced a separate formal investigation into X and xAI involving Grok and “its potential to produce harmful sexualised image and video content.” It joins another ongoing investigation in the UK from Ofcom, which also shared an update on Tuesday stating that it is not currently investigating xAI, but is still “gathering and analysing evidence to determine whether X has broken the law.”All of the investigations follow a flood of nonconsensual sexualized deepfakes generated by xAI’s Grok that have proliferated across X. The problem has persisted for weeks, despite claims by X that the feature has been restricted.X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Stevie BonifieldCloseStevie BonifieldNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All by Stevie BonifieldAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All AINewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All NewsPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All PolicyTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All TechTwitter - XCloseTwitter - XPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All Twitter - XxAIClosexAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All xAIMost PopularMost PopularElon Musk merges SpaceX with xAI (and X)How to tear gas childrenThe tragedy of SupernaturalFirefox is adding a switch to turn AI features offAdobe Animate is shutting down next monthThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.Nintendo has had plenty of highs over its few decades in the video game industry. Popularizing home consoles with the NES, introducing new audiences to games through the Wii’s motion controls, and the touchscreen Trojan horse that was the Nintendo DS, to name a few. But often these successes were followed by missteps; the Wii sold 100 million units, while its follow-up, the Wii U, couldn’t even manage a quarter of that. But that precarity looks to change. The Switch is now Nintendo’s best-selling console ever, surpassing the DS with 155 million units sold since its debut in 2017. And over that span Nintendo has transformed itself into a company better insulated against the ever-changing whims of the games industry.One of the key factors behind the Switch’s success was how it represented a more unified version of Nintendo. In 2013, the company merged its two main game development divisions, which had previously been split into home console and handheld groups. Given how the Switch straddled the line between console and handheld, this made a lot of sense. But it also allowed Nintendo to put the full might of its creative resources behind a single platform. The result was a string of massive hits: games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Super Mario Odyssey all sold upward of 30 million copies.RelatedNintendo’s bold new era is full of safe betsNintendo’s shiny new museum needs more dirtShigeru Miyamoto is working with his hands againJust as important, this structure allowed Nintendo to release big games consistently over the Switch’s lifespan. Even as the focus shifted to the next console, the Switch’s final years still included brand-new Zelda and Super Mario games. The structure has also allowed Nintendo to seamlessly continue this success into the launch of the Switch 2, which got off to a very fast start and debuted alongside a brand-new Mario Kart, which was followed by Donkey Kong and Metroid.The Nintendo Museum in Kyoto. Image: NintendoBut outside of games, which form the core of the company, Nintendo has also used the Switch’s success to steadily branch out in new directions. In 2023, The Super Mario Bros. Movie hit theaters, earned more than $1 billion, and now Nintendo has both a sequel and a live-action Zelda movie on the way. Nintendo opened its first theme park in Japan in 2021, and has since expanded to Hollywood and Florida, with a location in Singapore due up next. The company even opened its own museum in 2024. In essence, Nintendo is building an entertainment empire. Its competition is increasingly the likes of Disney and Netflix in addition to Xbox and PlayStation. “I think people view Nintendo as a gaming company,” Shinya Takahashi, Nintendo’s senior managing executive officer, told me in 2023. “But we have always thought of ourselves as an entertainment company.”It’s not a completely unique strategy: Just about every video game company is hoping to break out in film and television after the success of projects like The Last of Us, Fallout, and A Minecraft Movie. But in Nintendo’s case, the company seems to understand just how precarious a success like the Switch can be, and it used that success to steadily build itself up into something bigger in a deliberate, concerted way. It’s something Nintendo has tried to do before — see: the company’s ill-fated efforts into mobile gaming — but its resurgence during the Switch era allowed it to approach these ventures with a new level of focus and ambition. This is a company that’s so confident it’s about to release a $100 re-creation of the Virtual Boy, one of its greatest failures.All of this is to say that the version of Nintendo that launched the Switch in 2017 is very different from the Nintendo that exists now. Its footing is more solid, its future is more clear. And that future involves more than video games. This doesn’t guarantee future success, of course. The Switch 2 may be off to a strong start, but it’s also facing many pressures outside of Nintendo’s control, some of which have led to a world where many game consoles now get more expensive over time.But the new Switch also doesn’t need to match its predecessor’s success — it just needs to allow Nintendo to keep this momentum going.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew WebsterCloseAndrew WebsterSenior entertainment editorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All by Andrew WebsterAnalysisCloseAnalysisPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All AnalysisEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All EntertainmentGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All GamingNintendoCloseNintendoPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All NintendoReportCloseReportPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.FollowFollowSee All ReportMost PopularMost PopularElon Musk merges SpaceX with xAI (and X)How to tear gas childrenThe tragedy of SupernaturalFirefox is adding a switch to turn AI features offAdobe Animate is shutting down next monthThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Unlike most trackers that rely on Google’s Find Hub network, the AirTag-sized Moto Tags support ultra wideband tracking, allowing compatible Android phones to guide you directly to lost items via on-screen directional cues. They’re not our favorite Android trackers since they’re not as accurate as rival models at locating items outside your home, but they still work rather well for finding valuables inside the house.

The wireless earbuds are basically a smaller, lighter version of the LinkBuds S outfitted with Sony’s “Air Fitting Supporters,” which are wing tips designed to reduce pressure points. They also offer multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, IPX4 water resistance, and solid active noise cancellation courtesy of Sony’s V2 processor, which is the same chip found in the last-gen WF-1000XM5.Verge DealsSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC in an interview on Tuesday that the company would consider investing in OpenAI’s next fundraising round and the startup’s eventual IPO. Huang told CNBC Nvidia’s plans to invest in OpenAI remained on track following recent reports that the deal had been stalled. The chipmaker had announced plans last September to invest up to $100 billion in the startup. \"We will invest in the next round,\" Huang told CNBC’s Jim Cramer, calling it the \"largest private round ever raised in history\". Nvidia plans to make a \"huge\" investment in OpenAI, probably its largest ever, Huang said on Saturday, denying he was unhappy with the ChatGPT maker. OpenAI is looking to raise up to $100 billion in funding, valuing it at about $830 billion, Reuters reported previously.\nBoth companies did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. OpenAI is unsatisfied with some of Nvidia’s latest artificial-intelligence chips and has sought alternatives since last year, potentially complicating the relationship between the two highest-profile players in the AI boom, Reuters reported on Monday.
