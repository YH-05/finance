"""Rate limiter for SEC EDGAR API requests.

This module provides a thread-safe rate limiter that enforces the
SEC EDGAR fair access policy of 10 requests per second.

The implementation uses a simple token bucket algorithm with a
sliding window approach: it tracks timestamps of recent requests
and ensures the minimum interval between requests is respected.

Notes
-----
SEC EDGAR requires that automated tools make no more than 10 requests
per second. Exceeding this limit may result in IP-based throttling
or temporary bans.

class RateLimiter:
    """Thread-safe rate limiter for SEC EDGAR API requests.

    Uses a minimum interval approach to enforce the rate limit.
    Each call to ``acquire()`` ensures that enough time has passed
    since the last request before proceeding.

    Parameters
    ----------
    max_requests_per_second : int
        Maximum number of requests allowed per second.
        Defaults to ``DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT_PER_SECOND`` (10).

    Attributes
    ----------
    max_requests_per_second : int
        The configured maximum requests per second
    _min_interval : float
        Minimum time (in seconds) between consecutive requests
    _last_request_time : float
        Monotonic timestamp of the last request
    _lock : threading.Lock
        Lock for thread-safe access to timing state

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If max_requests_per_second is not positive

    Examples
    --------
    >>> limiter = RateLimiter(max_requests_per_second=10)
    >>> limiter.acquire()  # First request passes immediately
    >>> limiter.acquire()  # Second request may sleep if too fast
