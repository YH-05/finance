"""Data models for the news collection workflow.

This module provides core data models for representing news article sources
and their metadata in a unified format. These models are used throughout
the news collection pipeline.

Notes
-----
- `SourceType` represents the type of data source (RSS, yfinance, scraper)
- `ArticleSource` represents metadata about where an article came from
- `CollectedArticle` represents an article collected from a source

Examples
--------
>>> from news.models import SourceType, ArticleSource
>>> source = ArticleSource(
...     source_type=SourceType.RSS,
...     source_name="CNBC Markets",
...     category="market",
... )
>>> source.source_type
